# *** ASSERTION DESCRIPTION ***
#
# Verify that executing 'zfs inherit' at the top level in the hierarchy
# when the top level and bottom level properties are set locally and the 
# middle dataset has inherited from the top level, results in the top level
# properties reverting back to their default values, and the middle level
# inheriting the new top level value.
#
# Executing 'zfs inherit' at the bottom level results in it inheriting
# the middle level values.
