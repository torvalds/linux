# *** ASSERTION DESCRIPTION ***
#
# Verify that running 'zfs inherit -r' at each level of the data hierarchy
# when the bottom and middle level properties have been set locally results
# in the top level property values being propogated down the data
# hierarchy.
#
# Note : executing inherit -r at the middle level and bottom levels after
# running it at the top level is somewhat redundant as the top level value
# should propogate down the entire data hierarchy. Done for completeness
# sake.
