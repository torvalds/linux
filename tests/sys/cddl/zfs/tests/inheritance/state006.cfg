# *** ASSERTION DESCRIPTION ***
#
# No command is actually run (hence '-:-') but rather this state file is
# used to verify that when we set a property on a top level pool, followed
# by a bottom level filesystem, that the middle level dataset inherits
# the property from the top level pool, and not from the bottom level
# filesystem.
