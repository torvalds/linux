# *** ASSERTION DESCRIPTION ***
#
# Verify that executing 'zfs inherit -r' at the top level in the hierarchy
# when each levels properties are set locally, results in the top level
# properties reverting back to their default values, and the changed
# values being propogated down the hierarchy.
#
# Executing 'zfs inherit -r' at the middle and bottom levels after doing so
# at the top level is somewhat redundant but is done for completeness.
