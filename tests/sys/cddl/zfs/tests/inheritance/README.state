# For every configX.cfg file there must be a corresponding stateX.cfg
# file. The state file both drives the operations to be performed on the
# dataset hierarchy which has been specified by the corresponding
# configX.cfg file, and also specifies the expected state of the 
# properties after the operation has been completed.
#
# The format of the file is:
#       <target dataset>:<command>
#       <property source before command>        <property src after command>
#       <property source before command>        <property src after command>
#       ....                                    ....
#       ....                                    ....
#
# <target dataset> - dataset upon which the <command> is to be executed. Can
#                    be any of the datasets specified in the corresponding 
#                    configX.cfg file. If no command is to be executed
#                    then must be set to '-'
#                  
#
# <command>        - command to be executed upon the specified dataset.
#                    Currently the only supported commands are 'inherit' 
#                    or 'inherit -r'. If no command is to be executed, 
#                    then must be set to '-'.
#
# <property src before command>
#                  - the 'source' (as reported in 'zfs get') for the
#                    the properties before <command> is executed. This
#                    can be 'default', 'local' or the name of a dataset
#                    from which the property is inherited. (The code
#                    automatically adds in the 'inherited from..' part
#                    of the string when doing the check.
#
#                    This field is for informational purposes only, to 
#                    aid the user in seeing how the changes trickle down 
#                    the data hierarchy. 
#
# <property src after command>
#                  - the expected value of the 'source' field after the
#                    <command> has been executed on the <target dataset>.
#                    As above can be 'default', 'local', or the dataset
#                    from which the property is inherited.
#                       
# Two important things to note:
# 1) there must be a <property src..> line corresponding to each dataset
#    line specified in the configX.cfg file.
#
#
# 2) There can be as many <command>/<property src> blocks as desired, but
#    there must be at least one, and the effect of each block is cumulative
#    (i.e. the properties are not reset back to their default values between
#    each block. If that is desired then each block must be placed in its
#    own state file with its own corresponding configX.cfg file).
#
# 
# Below are two sample <command>/<property src> blocks. 
#
# The first simply verifies that the properties on the top level dataset 
# were set locally, and that the middle and bottom datasets properties
# were inherited from the top level pool (called TESTPOOL). Note the '-:-'
# which means that no command is to be executed, but simply that the
# properties settings are to be verified.
#
-:-
#
local                           local
TESTPOOL                        TESTPOOL
TESTPOOL                        TESTPOOL
#
#
# The block below describes the expected state of the properties after 
# an 'inherit -r' command has been run on the top level pool (called 
# TESTPOOL). 
#
TESTPOOL:inherit -r
#
local				default
TESTPOOL			default
TESTPOOL			default
