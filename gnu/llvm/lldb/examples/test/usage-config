# This is an example of using the "-c" option to source a config file to
# reassign the system stderr and stdout and to exercise different combinations
# of architectures and compilers.
#
# The config file is checked in as .lldbtest-config and the redirected stderr
# and stdout are checked in as lldbtest-stderr and lldbtest-stdout, all in the
# the same directory as this file.
