# Doxyfile 1.7.1

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See
# http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv for the list of possible encodings.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME           = LLDB

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number.
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = @PACKAGE_VERSION@

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute)
# base path where the generated documentation will be put.
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = @abs_top_builddir@/docs/cpp_reference

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES, then doxygen will create
# 4096 sub-directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output
# format and will distribute the generated files over these directories.
# Enabling this option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of
# source files, where putting all generated files in the same directory would
# otherwise cause performance problems for the file system.

CREATE_SUBDIRS         = NO

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language.
# The default language is English, other supported languages are:
# Afrikaans, Arabic, Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese, Chinese-Traditional,
# Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Farsi, Finnish, French, German,
# Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Japanese-en (Japanese with English
# messages), Korean, Korean-en, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Macedonian, Persian,
# Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Serbian-Cyrilic, Slovak,
# Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.

OUTPUT_LANGUAGE        = English

# If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# include brief member descriptions after the members that are listed in
# the file and class documentation (similar to JavaDoc).
# Set to NO to disable this.

BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC      = YES

# If the REPEAT_BRIEF tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will prepend
# the brief description of a member or function before the detailed description.
# Note: if both HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS and BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC are set to NO, the
# brief descriptions will be completely suppressed.

REPEAT_BRIEF           = YES

# This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator
# that is used to form the text in various listings. Each string
# in this list, if found as the leading text of the brief description, will be
# stripped from the text and the result after processing the whole list, is
# used as the annotated text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is.
# If left blank, the following values are used ("$name" is automatically
# replaced with the name of the entity): "The $name class" "The $name widget"
# "The $name file" "is" "provides" "specifies" "contains"
# "represents" "a" "an" "the"

# description.

ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC    = NO

# If the INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB tag is set to YES, doxygen will show all
# inherited members of a class in the documentation of that class as if those
# members were ordinary class members. Constructors, destructors and assignment
# operators of the base classes will not be shown.

INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB  = NO

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then Doxygen will prepend the full
# path before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set
# to NO the shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then the STRIP_FROM_PATH tag
# can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path. Stripping is
# only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand part of
# the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the
# path to strip.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        = ../..

# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of
# the path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells
# the reader which header file to include in order to use a class.
# If left blank only the name of the header file containing the class
# definition is used. Otherwise one should specify the include paths that
# are normally passed to the compiler using the -I flag.

STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH    =

# If the SHORT_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate much shorter
# (but less readable) file names. This can be useful is your file systems
# doesn't support long names like on DOS, Mac, or CD-ROM.

SHORT_NAMES            = NO

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen
# will interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a JavaDoc-style
# comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the JavaDoc
# comments will behave just like regular Qt-style comments
# (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief description.)

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES

# If the QT_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen will
# interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a Qt-style
# comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the comments
# will behave just like regular Qt-style comments (thus requiring
# an explicit \brief command for a brief description.)

QT_AUTOBRIEF           = YES

# The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make Doxygen
# treat a multi-line C++ special comment block (i.e. a block of //! or ///
# comments) as a brief description. This used to be the default behaviour.
# The new default is to treat a multi-line C++ comment block as a detailed
# description. Set this tag to YES if you prefer the old behaviour instead.

MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF = NO

# If the INHERIT_DOCS tag is set to YES (the default) then an undocumented
# member inherits the documentation from any documented member that it
# re-implements.

INHERIT_DOCS           = YES

# If the SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES tag is set to YES, then doxygen will produce
# a new page for each member. If set to NO, the documentation of a member will
# be part of the file/class/namespace that contains it.

SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES  = NO

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab.
# Doxygen uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.

TAB_SIZE               = 2

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that acts
# as commands in the documentation. An alias has the form "name=value".
# For example adding "sideeffect=\par Side Effects:\n" will allow you to
# put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the documentation, which
# will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading "Side Effects:".
# You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert newlines.

ALIASES                =

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C
# sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C.
# For instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list
# of all members will be omitted, etc.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = NO

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA tag to YES if your project consists of Java
# sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for
# Java. For instance, namespaces will be presented as packages, qualified
# scopes will look different, etc.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA   = NO

# Set the OPTIMIZE_FOR_FORTRAN tag to YES if your project consists of Fortran
# sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for
# Fortran.

# VHDL.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_VHDL   = NO

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it
# parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given extension.
# Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it using this
# tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and language
# is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, Javascript, CSharp, C,
# C++, D, PHP, Objective-C, Python, Fortran, VHDL, C, C++. For instance to make
# doxygen treat .inc files as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C
# (default is Fortran), use: inc=Fortran f=C. Note that for custom extensions
# you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise the files are not read by doxygen.

EXTENSION_MAPPING      =

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should
# set this tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string); v.s.
# func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.

BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT    = NO

# If you use Microsoft's C++/CLI language, you should set this option to YES to
# enable parsing support.

CPP_CLI_SUPPORT        = NO

# Set the SIP_SUPPORT tag to YES if your project consists of sip sources only.
# Doxygen will parse them like normal C++ but will assume all classes use public
# instead of private inheritance when no explicit protection keyword is present.

SIP_SUPPORT            = NO

# For Microsoft's IDL there are propget and propput attributes to indicate getter
# and setter methods for a property. Setting this option to YES (the default)
# will make doxygen to replace the get and set methods by a property in the
# documentation. This will only work if the methods are indeed getting or
# setting a simple type. If this is not the case, or you want to show the
# methods anyway, you should set this option to NO.

IDL_PROPERTY_SUPPORT   = YES

# If member grouping is used in the documentation and the DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC
# tag is set to YES, then doxygen will reuse the documentation of the first
# member in the group (if any) for the other members of the group. By default
# all members of a group must be documented explicitly.

DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC   = NO

# Set the SUBGROUPING tag to YES (the default) to allow class member groups of
# the same type (for instance a group of public functions) to be put as a
# subgroup of that type (e.g. under the Public Functions section). Set it to
# NO to prevent subgrouping. Alternatively, this can be done per class using
# the \nosubgrouping command.

SUBGROUPING            = YES

# When TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT is enabled, a typedef of a struct, union, or enum
# is documented as struct, union, or enum with the name of the typedef. So
# typedef struct TypeS {} TypeT, will appear in the documentation as a struct
# with name TypeT. When disabled the typedef will appear as a member of a file,
# namespace, or class. And the struct will be named TypeS. This can typically
# be useful for C code in case the coding convention dictates that all compound
# types are typedef'ed and only the typedef is referenced, never the tag name.

TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT   = NO

# The SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE determines the size of the internal cache use to
# determine which symbols to keep in memory and which to flush to disk.
# When the cache is full, less often used symbols will be written to disk.
# For small to medium size projects (<1000 input files) the default value is
# probably good enough. For larger projects a too small cache size can cause
# doxygen to be busy swapping symbols to and from disk most of the time
# causing a significant performance penality.
# If the system has enough physical memory increasing the cache will improve the
# performance by keeping more symbols in memory. Note that the value works on
# a logarithmic scale so increasing the size by one will rougly double the
# memory usage. The cache size is given by this formula:
# 2^(16+SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE). The valid range is 0..9, the default is 0,
# corresponding to a cache size of 2^16 = 65536 symbols

SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE      = 0
