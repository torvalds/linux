// C Language Family Front-end
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//

Welcome to Clang.  This is a compiler front-end for the C family of languages
(C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++) which is built as part of the LLVM
compiler infrastructure project.

Unlike many other compiler frontends, Clang is useful for a number of things
beyond just compiling code: we intend for Clang to be host to a number of
different source-level tools.  One example of this is the Clang Static Analyzer.

If you're interested in more (including how to build Clang) it is best to read
the relevant web sites.  Here are some pointers:
