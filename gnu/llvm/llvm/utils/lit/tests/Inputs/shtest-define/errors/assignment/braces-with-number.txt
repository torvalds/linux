# In python's re.sub patterns, '%{3}' means three '%%%'.  If we permitted that
# as a substitution name (and escaped it before recording it as a
# substitution), it would be confusing if someone tried to use the same name in
# a lit configuration file, where the pattern isn't escaped automatically.

# DEFINE: %{3} = value
# RUN: echo %{3}

#      CHECK: Substitution name '%{3}' is malformed {{.*}}
# CHECK-NEXT: in {{DEFINE}}: directive on test line [[#@LINE-4]]

# CHECK: Unresolved: 1 {{\([0-9]*.[0-9]*%\)}}
