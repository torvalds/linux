# Check that we route argv[0] as it was written, instead of the resolved
# path. This is important for some tools, in particular '[' which at least on OS
# X only recognizes that it is in '['-mode when its argv[0] is exactly
# '['. Otherwise it will refuse to accept the trailing closing bracket.

# RUN: [ "A" = "A" ]
