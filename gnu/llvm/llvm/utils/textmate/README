This directory contains a "bundle" for doing syntax highlighting of TableGen
files for the TextMate editor for OS X. The highlighting follows that done 
by the TextMate "C" bundle.  Currently, keywords, comments, and strings are 
highlighted.

To install this bundle, copy it to the per user area:
  cp -R utils/textmate/TableGen.tmbundle \
    ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/TableGen.tmbundle
