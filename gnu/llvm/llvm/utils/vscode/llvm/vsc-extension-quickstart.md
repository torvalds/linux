# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your language support and define the location of the grammar file that has been copied into your extension.
* `syntaxes/ll.tmLanguage.json` - this is the Text mate grammar file that is used for tokenization.
* `language-configuration.json` - this is the language configuration, defining the tokens that are used for comments and brackets.

## Get up and running straight away

* Make sure the language configuration settings in `language-configuration.json` are accurate.
* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Create a new file with a file name suffix matching your language.
* Verify that syntax highlighting works and that the language configuration settings are working.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Add more language features
