These are syntax highlighting files for the jEdit editor. Included are:

* tablegen.xml

  Syntax highlighting mode for TableGen description files. To use, copy this
  file to ~/.jedit/modes/ and add this code to your ~/.jedit/modes/catalog:

  <MODE NAME="tablegen" FILE="tablegen.xml" FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.td" />

Note: If you notice missing or incorrect syntax highlighting, please contact
<llvm-bugs [at] lists.llvm.org>; if you wish to provide a patch to improve the
functionality, it will be most appreciated. Thank you.
