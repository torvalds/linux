// The LiveRangeCalc class can be used to implement the computation of
// live ranges from scratch.
// It caches information about values in the CFG to speed up repeated
// operations on the same live range.  The cache can be shared by
// non-overlapping live ranges. SplitKit uses that when computing the live
// range of split products.
//
// A low-level interface is available to clients that know where a variable is
// live, but don't know which value it has as every point.  LiveRangeCalc will
// propagate values down the dominator tree, and even insert PHI-defs where
// needed. SplitKit uses this faster interface when possible.
