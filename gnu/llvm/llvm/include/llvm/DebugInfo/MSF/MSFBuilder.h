  /// at least `MinBlockCount` blocks.  This is useful when using `MSFBuilder`
  /// to read an existing MSF that you want to write back out later.  The
  /// original MSF file's SuperBlock contains the exact number of blocks used
  /// by the file, so is a good hint as to how many blocks the new MSF file
  /// will contain.  Furthermore, it is actually necessary in this case.  To
  /// preserve stability of the file's layout, it is helpful to try to keep
  /// all streams mapped to their original block numbers.  To ensure that this
  /// is possible, space for all blocks must be allocated beforehand so that
  /// streams can be assigned to them.
  ///
  /// \param CanGrow If true, any operation which results in an attempt to
  /// locate a free block when all available blocks have been exhausted will
  /// allocate a new block, thereby growing the size of the final MSF file.
  /// When false, any such attempt will result in an error.  This is especially
  /// useful in testing scenarios when you know your test isn't going to do
  /// anything to increase the size of the file, so having an Error returned if
  /// it were to happen would catch a programming error
  ///
  /// \returns an llvm::Error representing whether the operation succeeded or
  /// failed.  Currently the only way this can fail is if an invalid block size
  /// is specified, or `MinBlockCount` does not leave enough room for the
