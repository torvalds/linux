  /// On this stage method, in case when lossless bitcast is not possible
  /// method returns -1 or 1, thus also defining which type is greater in

  /// Stage 0: If types are equal in terms of cmpTypes, then we can go straight
  ///          to the contents comparison.
  ///          If types differ, remember types comparison result and check
  ///          whether we still can bitcast types.
  /// Stage 1: Types that satisfies isFirstClassType conditions are always
  ///          greater then others.
  /// Stage 2: Vector is greater then non-vector.
  ///          If both types are vectors, then vector with greater bitwidth is
  ///          greater.
  ///          If both types are vectors with the same bitwidth, then types
  ///          are bitcastable, and we can skip other stages, and go to contents
  ///          comparison.
  /// Stage 3: Pointer types are greater than non-pointers. If both types are
  ///          pointers of the same address space - go to contents comparison.
  ///          Different address spaces: pointer with greater address space is
  ///          greater.
  /// Stage 4: Types are neither vectors, nor pointers. And they differ.
  ///          We don't know how to bitcast them. So, we better don't do it,
  ///          and return types comparison result (so it determines the
  ///          relationship among constants we don't know how to bitcast).
  ///
  /// Just for clearance, let's see how the set of constants could look
  /// on single dimension axis:
  ///
  /// [NFCT], [FCT, "others"], [FCT, pointers], [FCT, vectors]
  /// Where: NFCT - Not a FirstClassType
  ///        FCT - FirstClassTyp:
  ///
  /// 2. Compare raw contents.
  /// It ignores types on this stage and only compares bits from L and R.
  /// Returns 0, if L and R has equivalent contents.
  /// -1 or 1 if values are different.
  /// Pretty trivial:
  /// 2.1. If contents are numbers, compare numbers.
  ///    Ints with greater bitwidth are greater. Ints with same bitwidths
  ///    compared by their contents.
  /// 2.2. "And so on". Just to avoid discrepancies with comments
  /// perhaps it would be better to read the implementation itself.
  /// 3. And again about overall picture. Let's look back at how the ordered set
  /// of constants will look like:
  /// [NFCT], [FCT, "others"], [FCT, pointers], [FCT, vectors]
  ///
  /// Now look, what could be inside [FCT, "others"], for example:
  /// [FCT, "others"] =
  /// [
  ///   [double 0.1], [double 1.23],
  ///   [i32 1], [i32 2],
  ///   { double 1.0 },       ; StructTyID, NumElements = 1
  ///   { i32 1 },            ; StructTyID, NumElements = 1
  ///   { double 1, i32 1 },  ; StructTyID, NumElements = 2
  ///   { i32 1, double 1 }   ; StructTyID, NumElements = 2
  /// ]
  ///
  /// Let's explain the order. Float numbers will be less than integers, just
  /// because of cmpType terms: FloatTyID < IntegerTyID.
  /// Floats (with same fltSemantics) are sorted according to their value.
  /// Then you can see integers, and they are, like a floats,
  /// could be easy sorted among each others.
  /// The structures. Structures are grouped at the tail, again because of their
  /// TypeID: StructTyID > IntegerTyID > FloatTyID.
  /// Structures with greater number of elements are greater. Structures with
  /// greater elements going first are greater.
  /// The same logic with vectors, arrays and other possible complex types.
  ///
  /// Bitcastable constants.
  /// Let's assume, that some constant, belongs to some group of
  /// "so-called-equal" values with different types, and at the same time
  /// belongs to another group of constants with equal types
  /// and "really" equal values.
  ///
  /// Now, prove that this is impossible:
  ///
  /// If constant A with type TyA is bitcastable to B with type TyB, then:
  /// 1. All constants with equal types to TyA, are bitcastable to B. Since
  ///    those should be vectors (if TyA is vector), pointers
  ///    (if TyA is pointer), or else (if TyA equal to TyB), those types should
  ///    be equal to TyB.
  /// 2. All constants with non-equal, but bitcastable types to TyA, are
  ///    bitcastable to B.
  ///    Once again, just because we allow it to vectors and pointers only.
  ///    This statement could be expanded as below:
  /// 2.1. All vectors with equal bitwidth to vector A, has equal bitwidth to
  ///      vector B, and thus bitcastable to B as well.
  /// 2.2. All pointers of the same address space, no matter what they point to,
  ///      bitcastable. So if C is pointer, it could be bitcasted to A and to B.
  /// So any constant equal or bitcastable to A is equal or bitcastable to B.
  /// QED.
  ///
  /// In another words, for pointers and vectors, we ignore top-level type and
  /// look at their particular properties (bit-width for vectors, and
  /// address space for pointers).
  /// If these properties are equal - compare their contents.

  /// this walk, the numbering depends only on how BBs located inside the CFG.

  ///

  /// from FR, we could compare their origins and check whether they are
  /// defined at the same place.

  /// could be operands from further BBs we didn't scan yet.
