/// info analysis. It can be used for any kind of CFG (Loop, MachineLoop,
/// Function, MachineFunction, etc.) by providing an RPO traversal (\p
/// RPOTraversal) and the loop info analysis (\p LI) of the CFG. This utility
/// function is only recommended when loop info analysis is available. If loop
/// info analysis isn't available, please, don't compute it explicitly for this
/// purpose. There are more efficient ways to detect CFG irreducibility that
/// don't require recomputing loop info analysis (e.g., T1/T2 or Tarjan's
/// algorithm).
///
/// Requirements:
///   1) GraphTraits must be implemented for NodeT type. It is used to access
///      NodeT successors.
//    2) \p RPOTraversal must be a valid reverse post-order traversal of the
///      target CFG with begin()/end() iterator interfaces.
///   3) \p LI must be a valid LoopInfoBase that contains up-to-date loop
///      analysis information of the CFG.
///
/// This algorithm uses the information about reducible loop back-edges already
/// computed in \p LI. When a back-edge is found during the RPO traversal, the
/// algorithm checks whether the back-edge is one of the reducible back-edges in
/// loop info. If it isn't, the CFG is irreducible. For example, for the CFG
/// below (canonical irreducible graph) loop info won't contain any loop, so the
/// algorithm will return that the CFG is irreducible when checking the B <-
/// -> C back-edge.
