/// Implements a lazy call graph analysis and related passes for the new pass
/// manager.
///
/// NB: This is *not* a traditional call graph! It is a graph which models both
/// the current calls and potential calls. As a consequence there are many
/// edges in this call graph that do not correspond to a 'call' or 'invoke'
/// instruction.
///
/// The primary use cases of this graph analysis is to facilitate iterating
/// across the functions of a module in ways that ensure all callees are
/// visited prior to a caller (given any SCC constraints), or vice versa. As
/// such is it particularly well suited to organizing CGSCC optimizations such
/// as inlining, outlining, argument promotion, etc. That is its primary use
/// case and motivates the design. It may not be appropriate for other
/// purposes. The use graph of functions or some other conservative analysis of
/// call instructions may be interesting for optimizations and subsequent
/// analyses which don't work in the context of an overly specified
/// potential-call-edge graph.
///
/// To understand the specific rules and nature of this call graph analysis,
/// see the documentation of the \c LazyCallGraph below.

/// A lazily constructed view of the call graph of a module.
///
/// With the edges of this graph, the motivating constraint that we are
/// attempting to maintain is that function-local optimization, CGSCC-local
/// optimizations, and optimizations transforming a pair of functions connected
/// by an edge in the graph, do not invalidate a bottom-up traversal of the SCC
/// DAG. That is, no optimizations will delete, remove, or add an edge such
/// that functions already visited in a bottom-up order of the SCC DAG are no
/// longer valid to have visited, or such that functions not yet visited in
/// a bottom-up order of the SCC DAG are not required to have already been
/// visited.
///
/// Within this constraint, the desire is to minimize the merge points of the
/// SCC DAG. The greater the fanout of the SCC DAG and the fewer merge points
/// in the SCC DAG, the more independence there is in optimizing within it.
/// There is a strong desire to enable parallelization of optimizations over
/// the call graph, and both limited fanout and merge points will (artificially
/// in some cases) limit the scaling of such an effort.
///
/// To this end, graph represents both direct and any potential resolution to
/// an indirect call edge. Another way to think about it is that it represents
/// both the direct call edges and any direct call edges that might be formed
/// through static optimizations. Specifically, it considers taking the address
/// of a function to be an edge in the call graph because this might be
/// forwarded to become a direct call by some subsequent function-local
/// optimization. The result is that the graph closely follows the use-def
/// edges for functions. Walking "up" the graph can be done by looking at all
/// of the uses of a function.
///
/// The roots of the call graph are the external functions and functions
/// escaped into global variables. Those functions can be called from outside
/// of the module or via unknowable means in the IR -- we may not be able to
/// form even a potential call edge from a function body which may dynamically
/// load the function and call it.
///
/// This analysis still requires updates to remain valid after optimizations
/// which could potentially change the set of potential callees. The
/// constraints it operates under only make the traversal order remain valid.
///
/// The entire analysis must be re-computed if full interprocedural
/// optimizations run at any point. For example, globalopt completely
/// invalidates the information in this analysis.
///
/// FIXME: This class is named LazyCallGraph in a lame attempt to distinguish
/// it from the existing CallGraph. At some point, it is expected that this
