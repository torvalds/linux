// This analysis computes the optimal spill code placement between basic blocks.
//
// The runOnMachineFunction() method only precomputes some profiling information
// about the CFG. The real work is done by prepare(), addConstraints(), and
// finish() which are called by the register allocator.
//
// Given a variable that is live across multiple basic blocks, and given
// constraints on the basic blocks where the variable is live, determine which
// edge bundles should have the variable in a register and which edge bundles
// should have the variable in a stack slot.
//
// The returned bit vector can be used to place optimal spill code at basic
// block entries and exits. Spill code placement inside a basic block is not
// considered.
