Subject: windows vs. llvm

If you're interested, here are some of the major problems compiling LLVM
under Cygwin and/or Mingw.

1. Cygwin doesn't have <inttypes.h> or <stdint.h>, so all the INT*_MAX
   symbols and standard int*_t types are off in limbo somewhere. Mingw has
   <stdint.h>, but Cygwin doesn't like it.

2. Mingw doesn't have <dlfcn.h> (because Windows doesn't have it.)

3. SA_SIGINFO and friends are not around; only signal() seems to work.

4. Relink, aka ld -r, doesn't work (probably an ld bug); you need
   DONT_BUILD_RELINKED. This breaks all the tools makefiles; you just need to
   change them to have .a's.

5. There isn't a <values.h>.

6. There isn't a mallinfo() (or, at least, it's documented, but it doesn't seem
   to link).

7. The version of Bison that cygwin (and newer Linux versions) comes with
   does not like = signs in rules. Burg's gram.yc source file uses them. I think
   you can just take them out.
