#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This script starts a shell in a container running the libc++ build bot Docker
# image. That image emulates the environment used by libc++'s Linux builders on
# BuildKite.
#
# Once you're inside the shell, you can run the various build jobs with the
# `run-buildbot` script.
#
# This script must be run from within the LLVM monorepo. Furthermore, the
# monorepo will be mounted as `/llvm` inside the container. Be careful, the
# state in `/llvm` is shared between the container and the host machine, which
# is useful for editing files on the host machine and re-running the build bot
# in the container.
#
# If you are on Linux you will likely not be able to write to the mount because
# the user in the container doesn't have permissions to do so.
# If you need to do this, give that user permission to do so after running
# the container or add this flag to run the container as your local user IDs:
# --user $(id -u):$(id -g)
