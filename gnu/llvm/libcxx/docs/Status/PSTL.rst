Overview
========

This document contains the status of the Parallel STL (PSTL) in libc++. It is
used to track both the status of the sub-projects of the PSTL and who is
assigned to these sub-projects. This is imperative to effective implementation
so that work is not duplicated.

If you are interested in contributing to the libc++ PSTL, please send a message
to the #libcxx channel in the LLVM discord. Please *do not* start working on
any of the *assigned* items below.

Sub-Projects in the Implementation Effort
