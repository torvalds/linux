Overview
========

This document contains the status of the C++23 zip implementation in libc++.
It is used to track both the status of the sub-projects of the effort and who
is assigned to these sub-projects. This avoids duplicating effort.

If you are interested in contributing to this effort, please send a message
to the #libcxx channel in the LLVM discord. Please *do not* start working
on any items below that has already been assigned to someone else.
