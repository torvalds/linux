Overview
================================

In April 2013, the C++ standard committee approved the draft for the next version of the C++ standard, initially known as "C++1y".

The draft standard includes papers and issues that were voted on at the previous three meetings (Kona, Portland, and Bristol).

In August 2014, this draft was approved by ISO as C++14.

This page shows the status of libc++; the status of clang's support of the language features is `here <https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx14>`__.

The groups that have contributed papers:

-  CWG - Core Language Working group
-  LWG - Library working group
-  SG1 - Study group #1 (Concurrency working group)
