Overview
================================

This document contains the status of the Ranges library in libc++. It is used to track
both the status of the sub-projects of the ranges library and who is assigned to these
sub-projects. This is imperative to effective implementation so that work is not
duplicated and implementors are not blocked by each other.

If you are interested in contributing to the libc++ Ranges library, please send a message
to the #libcxx channel in the LLVM discord. Please *do not* start working on any of the
*assigned* items below.
