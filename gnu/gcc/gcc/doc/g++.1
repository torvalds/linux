.PP
Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
remainder.  \fBg++\fR accepts mostly the same options as \fBgcc\fR.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
When you invoke \s-1GCC\s0, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The \*(L"overall options\*(R" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the \fB\-c\fR option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
.PP
Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
.PP
Most of the command line options that you can use with \s-1GCC\s0 are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually \*(C+), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.
.PP
The \fBgcc\fR program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may \fInot\fR be grouped: \fB\-dr\fR is very different from \fB\-d\ \-r\fR.
.PP
You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several options
of the same kind; for example, if you specify \fB\-L\fR more than once,
the directories are searched in the order specified.
.PP
Many options have long names starting with \fB\-f\fR or with
\&\fB\-W\fR\-\-\-for example, 
\&\fB\-fmove\-loop\-invariants\fR, \fB\-Wformat\fR and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
\&\fB\-ffoo\fR would be \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  \s-1GCC\s0 is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.
.PP
For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

Normally the \fBgcc\fR program will exit with the code of 1 if any

\&\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR, the \fBgcc\fR program will instead return with
numerically highest error produced by any phase that returned an error

compiler error is encountered.
.PP
If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
\&\fB\-x\fR (or filename suffixes) to tell \fBgcc\fR where to start, and
one of the options \fB\-c\fR, \fB\-S\fR, or \fB\-E\fR to say where

sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

If \fB\-o\fR is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in \fIa.out\fR, the object file for
\&\fI\fIsource\fI.\fIsuffix\fI\fR in \fI\fIsource\fI.o\fR, its
assembler file in \fI\fIsource\fI.s\fR, a precompiled header file in

of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.
.IP "\fB\-###\fR" 4

Like \fB\-v\fR except the commands are not executed and all command
arguments are quoted.  This is useful for shell scripts to capture the
driver-generated command lines.
.IP "\fB\-pipe\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pipe"
Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the \s-1GNU\s0 assembler has
no trouble.
.IP "\fB\-combine\fR" 4
.IX Item "-combine"
If you are compiling multiple source files, this option tells the driver
to pass all the source files to the compiler at once (for those
languages for which the compiler can handle this).  This will allow
intermodule analysis (\s-1IMA\s0) to be performed by the compiler.  Currently the only
language for which this is supported is C.  If you pass source files for
multiple languages to the driver, using this option, the driver will invoke
the compiler(s) that support \s-1IMA\s0 once each, passing each compiler all the
source files appropriate for it.  For those languages that do not support
\&\s-1IMA\s0 this option will be ignored, and the compiler will be invoked once for
each source file in that language.  If you use this option in conjunction
with \fB\-save\-temps\fR, the compiler will generate multiple
pre-processed files
(one for each source file), but only one (combined) \fI.o\fR or
\&\fI.s\fR file.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line options
understood by \fBgcc\fR.  If the \fB\-v\fR option is also specified
then \fB\-\-help\fR will also be passed on to the various processes
invoked by \fBgcc\fR, so that they can display the command line options
they accept.  If the \fB\-Wextra\fR option is also specified then command
line options which have no documentation associated with them will also
be displayed.
.IP "\fB\-\-target\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--target-help"
Print (on the standard output) a description of target specific command
line options for each tool.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4

Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked \s-1GCC\s0.
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.  
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.
.Sh "Compiling \*(C+ Programs"
.IX Subsection "Compiling  Programs"
\&\*(C+ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes \fB.C\fR,
\&\fB.cc\fR, \fB.cpp\fR, \fB.CPP\fR, \fB.c++\fR, \fB.cp\fR, or
\&\fB.cxx\fR; \*(C+ header files often use \fB.hh\fR or \fB.H\fR; and
preprocessed \*(C+ files use the suffix \fB.ii\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as \*(C+ programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually
with the name \fBgcc\fR).
.PP
However, the use of \fBgcc\fR does not add the \*(C+ library.
\&\fBg++\fR is a program that calls \s-1GCC\s0 and treats \fB.c\fR,
\&\fB.h\fR and \fB.i\fR files as \*(C+ source files instead of C source
files unless \fB\-x\fR is used, and automatically specifies linking
against the \*(C+ library.  This program is also useful when
precompiling a C header file with a \fB.h\fR extension for use in \*(C+
compilations.  On many systems, \fBg++\fR is also installed with
the name \fBc++\fR.
.PP
When you compile \*(C+ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for \*(C+ programs.

.IX Item "-ansi"
In C mode, support all \s-1ISO\s0 C90 programs.  In \*(C+ mode,
remove \s-1GNU\s0 extensions that conflict with \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+.
.Sp
This turns off certain features of \s-1GCC\s0 that are incompatible with \s-1ISO\s0
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard \*(C+ (when compiling \*(C+ code),
such as the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR keywords, and
predefined macros such as \f(CW\*(C`unix\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`vax\*(C'\fR that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used \s-1ISO\s0 trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of \*(C+ style \fB//\fR comments as well as
the \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR keyword.
.Sp
The alternate keywords \f(CW\*(C`_\|_asm_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_inline_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR continue to work despite
\&\fB\-ansi\fR.  You would not want to use them in an \s-1ISO\s0 C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with \fB\-ansi\fR.  Alternate predefined macros
such as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_unix_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_vax_\|_\*(C'\fR are also available, with or
without \fB\-ansi\fR.
.Sp
The \fB\-ansi\fR option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, \fB\-pedantic\fR is required in
addition to \fB\-ansi\fR.  
.Sp
The macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STRICT_ANSI_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined when the \fB\-ansi\fR
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
\&\s-1ISO\s0 standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.
.Sp
Functions which would normally be built in but do not have semantics
defined by \s-1ISO\s0 C (such as \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ffs\*(C'\fR) are not built-in

This option is accepted by \s-1GCC\s0 versions 4.1.3 and up.  In \s-1GCC\s0 versions
prior to 4.3, C99 inline semantics are not supported, and thus this

disable warnings about using inline functions in C99 mode.  Likewise,
the option \fB\-fno\-gnu89\-inline\fR is not supported in versions of

Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with

.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR may become single
instructions that adjust the stack directly, and calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, \s-1GCC\s0 may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with \fB\-Wformat\fR for bad calls to
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR, when \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR is built in, and \f(CW\*(C`strlen\*(C'\fR is

not necessarily be at \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR.  The most obvious example is an \s-1OS\s0 kernel.
This is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-hosted\fR.

Formerly, these options caused \s-1GCC\s0 to attempt to emulate a pre-standard

.IP "\fB\-fcond\-mismatch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcond-mismatch"

.IP "\fB\-funsigned\-char\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funsigned-char"
Let the type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR be unsigned, like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Each kind of machine has a default for what \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR should
be.  It is either like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR by default or like
\&\f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR by default.
.Sp
Ideally, a portable program should always use \f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.
.Sp
The type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR is always a distinct type from each of
\&\f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.
.IP "\fB\-fsigned\-char\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsigned-char"
Let the type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR be signed, like \f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Note that this is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-unsigned\-char\fR, which is
the negative form of \fB\-funsigned\-char\fR.  Likewise, the option
\&\fB\-fno\-signed\-char\fR is equivalent to \fB\-funsigned\-char\fR.

.PD
These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either \f(CW\*(C`signed\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`unsigned\*(C'\fR.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR are signed types.
.Sh "Options Controlling \*(C+ Dialect"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling  Dialect"
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for \*(C+ programs; but you can also use most of the \s-1GNU\s0 compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file \f(CW\*(C`firstClass.C\*(C'\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C
.Ve
.PP
In this example, only \fB\-frepo\fR is an option meant
only for \*(C+ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by \s-1GCC\s0.
.PP
Here is a list of options that are \fIonly\fR for compiling \*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fabi\-version=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fabi-version=n"
Use version \fIn\fR of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0.  Version 2 is the version of the
\&\*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 that first appeared in G++ 3.4.  Version 1 is the version of
the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 that first appeared in G++ 3.2.  Version 0 will always be
the version that conforms most closely to the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 specification.
Therefore, the \s-1ABI\s0 obtained using version 0 will change as \s-1ABI\s0 bugs
are fixed.
.Sp
The default is version 2.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-access\-control\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-access-control"
Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.
.IP "\fB\-fcheck\-new\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcheck-new"
Check that the pointer returned by \f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the \*(C+ standard specifies that
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR will only return \f(CW0\fR if it is declared
\&\fB\f(BIthrow()\fB\fR, in which case the compiler will always check the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing \f(CW\*(C`std::bad_alloc\*(C'\fR.  See also
\&\fBnew (nothrow)\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fconserve\-space\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconserve-space"
Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the
common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at the
cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you compile with this
flag and your program mysteriously crashes after \f(CW\*(C`main()\*(C'\fR has
completed, you may have an object that is being destroyed twice because
two definitions were merged.
.Sp
This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support has
been added for putting variables into \s-1BSS\s0 without making them common.
.IP "\fB\-ffriend\-injection\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffriend-injection"
Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they are
visible outside the scope of the class in which they are declared.
Friend functions were documented to work this way in the old Annotated
\&\*(C+ Reference Manual, and versions of G++ before 4.1 always worked
that way.  However, in \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ a friend function which is not declared
in an enclosing scope can only be found using argument dependent
lookup.  This option causes friends to be injected as they were in
earlier releases.
.Sp
This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in a future
release of G++.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-elide\-constructors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-elide-constructors"
The \*(C+ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
which is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-enforce\-eh\-specs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-enforce-eh-specs"
Don't generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at runtime.  This option violates the \*(C+ standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
\&\fB\s-1NDEBUG\s0\fR.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
will still optimize based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception will result in undefined behavior.
.IP "\fB\-ffor\-scope\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffor-scope"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-fno\-for\-scope\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-for-scope"
.PD
If \fB\-ffor\-scope\fR is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a \fIfor-init-statement\fR is limited to the \fBfor\fR loop itself,
as specified by the \*(C+ standard.
If \fB\-fno\-for\-scope\fR is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a \fIfor-init-statement\fR extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of \*(C+.
.Sp
The default if neither flag is given to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-gnu\-keywords\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-gnu-keywords"
Do not recognize \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR instead.
\&\fB\-ansi\fR implies \fB\-fno\-gnu\-keywords\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-implicit\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implicit-templates"
Never emit code for non-inline templates which are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-implicit\-inline\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implicit-inline-templates"
Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization will need the same set of explicit instantiations.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-implement\-inlines\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implement-inlines"
To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by \fB#pragma implementation\fR.  This will cause linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.
.IP "\fB\-fms\-extensions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fms-extensions"
Disable pedantic warnings about constructs used in \s-1MFC\s0, such as implicit
int and getting a pointer to member function via non-standard syntax.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-nonansi\-builtins\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-nonansi-builtins"
Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
\&\s-1ANSI/ISO\s0 C.  These include \f(CW\*(C`ffs\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_exit\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`index\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bzero\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`conjf\*(C'\fR, and other related functions.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-operator\-names\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-operator-names"
Do not treat the operator name keywords \f(CW\*(C`and\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bitand\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`bitor\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`compl\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`not\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`or\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`xor\*(C'\fR as
synonyms as keywords.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-optional\-diags\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-optional-diags"
Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.
.IP "\fB\-fpermissive\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpermissive"
Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using \fB\-fpermissive\fR will allow some
nonconforming code to compile.
.IP "\fB\-frepo\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frepo"
Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also
implies \fB\-fno\-implicit\-templates\fR.  
.IP "\fB\-fno\-rtti\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-rtti"
Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the \*(C+ runtime type identification features
(\fBdynamic_cast\fR and \fBtypeid\fR).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but it will generate it as
needed. The \fBdynamic_cast\fR operator can still be used for casts that
do not require runtime type information, i.e. casts to \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR or to
unambiguous base classes.
.IP "\fB\-fstats\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstats"
Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.
This information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.
.IP "\fB\-ftemplate\-depth\-\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftemplate-depth-n"
Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to \fIn\fR.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  \s-1ANSI/ISO\s0 \*(C+
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-threadsafe\-statics\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-threadsafe-statics"
Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the \*(C+
\&\s-1ABI\s0 for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use this
option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need to be
thread\-safe.
.IP "\fB\-fuse\-cxa\-atexit\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fuse-cxa-atexit"
Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR function rather than the \f(CW\*(C`atexit\*(C'\fR function.
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but will only work if your C library supports
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-use\-cxa\-get\-exception\-ptr\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr"
Don't use the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_get_exception_ptr\*(C'\fR runtime routine.  This
will cause \f(CW\*(C`std::uncaught_exception\*(C'\fR to be incorrect, but is necessary
if the runtime routine is not available.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility\-inlines\-hidden\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility-inlines-hidden"
This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline methods where the addresses of the two functions
were taken in different shared objects.
.Sp
The effect of this is that \s-1GCC\s0 may, effectively, mark inline methods with
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_ ((visibility ("hidden")))\*(C'\fR so that they do not
appear in the export table of a \s-1DSO\s0 and do not require a \s-1PLT\s0 indirection
when used within the \s-1DSO\s0.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a \s-1DSO\s0 as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.
.Sp
The behaviour of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.
.Sp
You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility will have no effect.
.Sp
Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-weak\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-weak"
Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.
By default, G++ will use weak symbols if they are available.  This
option exists only for testing, and should not be used by end\-users;
it will result in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.
.IP "\fB\-nostdinc++\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdinc++"
Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
\&\*(C+, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the \*(C+ library.)
.PP
In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for \*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fno\-default\-inline\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-default-inline"
Do not assume \fBinline\fR for functions defined inside a class scope.
  Note that these
functions will have linkage like inline functions; they just won't be
inlined by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wabi\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wabi ( only)"
Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the
vendor-neutral \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0.  Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
will be compatible.
.Sp
You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.
.Sp
The known incompatibilities at this point include:
.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit\-fields.  G++ may attempt to
pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
\&        struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, G++ will place \f(CW\*(C`B::f2\*(C'\fR into the same byte
as\f(CW\*(C`A::f1\*(C'\fR; other compilers will not.  You can avoid this problem
by explicitly padding \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR so that its size is a multiple of the
byte size on your platform; that will cause G++ and other compilers to
layout \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR identically.
.IP "*" 4
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
\&        struct B { B(); char c2; };
\&        struct C : public A, public virtual B {};
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, G++ will not place \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR into the tail-padding for
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR; other compilers will.  You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR so that its size is a multiple of its
alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that will cause G++ and other
compilers to layout \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR identically.
.IP "*" 4
Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that
of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        union U { int i : 4096; };
.Ve
.Sp
Assuming that an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR does not have 4096 bits, G++ will make the
union too small by the number of bits in an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.
.IP "*" 4
Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        struct A {};
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        struct B {
\&          A a;
\&          virtual void f ();
\&        };
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        struct C : public B, public A {};
.Ve
.Sp
G++ will place the \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR base class of \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR at a nonzero offset;
it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR data member of \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR is already at offset zero.
.IP "*" 4
Names of template functions whose types involve \f(CW\*(C`typename\*(C'\fR or
template template parameters can be mangled incorrectly.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        template <typename Q>
\&        void f(typename Q::X) {}
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        template <template <typename> class Q>
\&        void f(typename Q<int>::X) {}
.Ve
.Sp
Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.

.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-null\-sentinel\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-null-sentinel ( only)"
Warn also about the use of an uncasted \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR as sentinel.  When
compiling only with \s-1GCC\s0 this is a valid sentinel, as \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR is defined
to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_null\*(C'\fR.  Although it is a null pointer constant not a null pointer,
it is guaranteed to of the same size as a pointer.  But this use is
not portable across different compilers.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-non\-template\-friend\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-non-template-friend ( only)"
Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template specification
support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
\&\fBfriend foo(int)\fR), the \*(C+ language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section
14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for G++, \fB\-Wnon\-template\-friend\fR allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots and is on by default.
This new compiler behavior can be turned off with
\&\fB\-Wno\-non\-template\-friend\fR which keeps the conformant compiler code
but disables the helpful warning.
.IP "\fB\-Wold\-style\-cast\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4

.Sh "Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ Dialects"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective- Dialects"
(\s-1NOTE:\s0 This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+
languages themselves.  See 
.PP
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs, but you can also use most of
the language-independent \s-1GNU\s0 compiler options.
For example, you might compile a file \f(CW\*(C`some_class.m\*(C'\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m
.Ve
.PP
In this example, \fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs; you can use the other options with
any language supported by \s-1GCC\s0.
.PP
Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR).  Similarly, Objective\-\*(C+ compilations may use
\&\*(C+\-specific options (e.g., \fB\-Wabi\fR).
.PP
Here is a list of options that are \fIonly\fR for compiling Objective-C
and Objective\-\*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class=\fR\fIclass-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconstant-string-class=class-name"
Use \fIclass-name\fR as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR.  The default
class name is \f(CW\*(C`NXConstantString\*(C'\fR if the \s-1GNU\s0 runtime is being used, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`NSConstantString\*(C'\fR if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
\&\fB\-fconstant\-cfstrings\fR option, if also present, will override the
\&\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class\fR setting and cause \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.
.IP "\fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgnu-runtime"
Generate object code compatible with the standard \s-1GNU\s0 Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.
.IP "\fB\-fnext\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnext-runtime"
Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac \s-1OS\s0 X.  The macro
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_NEXT_RUNTIME_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-nil\-receivers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-nil-receivers"
Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (e.g.,
\&\f(CW\*(C`[receiver message:arg]\*(C'\fR) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver
is not \f(CW\*(C`nil\*(C'\fR.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the runtime
to be used.  Currently, this option is only available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.3 and later.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-call\-cxx\-cdtors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors"
For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
\&\*(C+ object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR instance method that will run
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return \f(CW\*(C`self\*(C'\fR.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a \*(C+ object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR method that will run
all such default destructors, in reverse order.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR and/or \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods
thusly generated will only operate on instance variables declared in the
current Objective-C class, and not those inherited from superclasses.  It
is the responsibility of the Objective-C runtime to invoke all such methods
in an object's inheritance hierarchy.  The \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR methods
will be invoked by the runtime immediately after a new object
instance is allocated; the \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods will
be invoked immediately before the runtime deallocates an object instance.
.Sp
As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.4 and later has
support for invoking the \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-direct\-dispatch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-direct-dispatch"
Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.  On Darwin this is
accomplished via the comm page.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-exceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-exceptions"
Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in Objective\-C,
similar to what is offered by \*(C+ and Java.  This option is
unavailable in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.2 and
earlier.

.Sp
The \f(CW@throw\fR statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C or
Objective\-\*(C+ program; when used inside of a \f(CW@catch\fR block, the
\&\f(CW@throw\fR may appear without an argument (as shown above), in which case
the object caught by the \f(CW@catch\fR will be rethrown.
.Sp
Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and
caught using this scheme.  When an object is thrown, it will be caught
by the nearest \f(CW@catch\fR clause capable of handling objects of that type,
analogously to how \f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR blocks work in \*(C+ and Java.  A
\&\f(CW\*(C`@catch(id ...)\*(C'\fR clause (as shown above) may also be provided to catch
any and all Objective-C exceptions not caught by previous \f(CW@catch\fR
clauses (if any).
.Sp
The \f(CW@finally\fR clause, if present, will be executed upon exit from the
immediately preceding \f(CW\*(C`@try ... @catch\*(C'\fR section.  This will happen
regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown, caught or rethrown
inside the \f(CW\*(C`@try ... @catch\*(C'\fR section, analogously to the behavior
of the \f(CW\*(C`finally\*(C'\fR clause in Java.
.Sp
There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:
.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
Although currently designed to be binary compatible with \f(CW\*(C`NS_HANDLER\*(C'\fR\-style
idioms provided by the \f(CW\*(C`NSException\*(C'\fR class, the new
exceptions can only be used on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.3 (Panther) and later
systems, due to additional functionality needed in the (NeXT) Objective-C
runtime.
.IP "*" 4
As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling
types other than Objective-C objects.   Furthermore, when used from
Objective\-\*(C+, the Objective-C exception model does not interoperate with \*(C+
exceptions at this time.  This means you cannot \f(CW@throw\fR an exception
from Objective-C and \f(CW\*(C`catch\*(C'\fR it in \*(C+, or vice versa
(i.e., \f(CW\*(C`throw ... @catch\*(C'\fR).
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The \fB\-fobjc\-exceptions\fR switch also enables the use of synchronization
blocks for thread-safe execution:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&          @synchronized (ObjCClass *guard) {
\&            ...
\&          }
.Ve
.Sp
Upon entering the \f(CW@synchronized\fR block, a thread of execution shall
first check whether a lock has been placed on the corresponding \f(CW\*(C`guard\*(C'\fR
object by another thread.  If it has, the current thread shall wait until
the other thread relinquishes its lock.  Once \f(CW\*(C`guard\*(C'\fR becomes available,
the current thread will place its own lock on it, execute the code contained in
the \f(CW@synchronized\fR block, and finally relinquish the lock (thereby
making \f(CW\*(C`guard\*(C'\fR available to other threads).
.Sp
Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be marked
\&\f(CW@synchronized\fR.  Note that throwing exceptions out of
\&\f(CW@synchronized\fR blocks is allowed, and will cause the guarding object
to be unlocked properly.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-gc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-gc"
Enable garbage collection (\s-1GC\s0) in Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs.
.IP "\fB\-freplace\-objc\-classes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freplace-objc-classes"
Emit a special marker instructing \fB\f(BIld\fB\|(1)\fR not to statically link in
the resulting object file, and allow \fB\f(BIdyld\fB\|(1)\fR to load it in at
run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-Continue
debugging mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled and
dynamically reloaded in the course of program execution, without the need
to restart the program itself.  Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality
is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS\s0 X 10.3
and later.
.IP "\fB\-fzero\-link\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fzero-link"
When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the \fB\-fzero\-link\fR flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.
.IP "\fB\-gen\-decls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gen-decls"
Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a
file named \fI\fIsourcename\fI.decl\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wassign\-intercept\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wassign-intercept"
Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted by the
garbage collector.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-protocol\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-protocol"
If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the \fB\-Wno\-protocol\fR option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.
.IP "\fB\-Wselector\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wselector"
Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the \fB\-fsyntax\-only\fR option is
being used.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-selector\-match\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-selector-match"
Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are
found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this
selector to a receiver of type \f(CW\*(C`id\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Class\*(C'\fR.  When this flag
is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler will omit such warnings
if any differences found are confined to types which share the same size
and alignment.
.IP "\fB\-Wundeclared\-selector\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wundeclared-selector"
Warn if a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression referring to an
undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
method with that name has been declared before the
\&\f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression, either explicitly in an
\&\f(CW@interface\fR or \f(CW@protocol\fR declaration, or implicitly in
an \f(CW@implementation\fR section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression is found,
while \fB\-Wselector\fR only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation.  This also enforces the coding style convention
that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.
.IP "\fB\-print\-objc\-runtime\-info\fR" 4
.IX Item "-print-objc-runtime-info"
Generate C header describing the largest structure that is passed by
value, if any.
.Sh "Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting"
.IX Subsection "Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting"
Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...).  The options described
below can be used to control the diagnostic messages formatting
algorithm, e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Right now, only the \*(C+ front end can
honor these options.  However it is expected, in the near future, that
the remaining front ends would be able to digest them correctly.
.IP "\fB\-fmessage\-length=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmessage-length=n"
Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about \fIn\fR
characters.  The default is 72 characters for \fBg++\fR and 0 for the rest of
the front ends supported by \s-1GCC\s0.  If \fIn\fR is zero, then no
line-wrapping will be done; each error message will appear on a single
line.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-location=once\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-show-location=once"
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit \fIonce\fR source location information; that is, in
case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to
be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again,
over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-location=every\-line\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line"
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
a message which is too long to fit on a single line.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-option\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-show-option"
This option instructs the diagnostic machinery to add text to each
diagnostic emitted, which indicates which command line option directly
controls that diagnostic, when such an option is known to the
diagnostic machinery.
.Sh "Options to Request or Suppress Warnings"
.IX Subsection "Options to Request or Suppress Warnings"
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which
are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.
.PP
You can request many specific warnings with options beginning \fB\-W\fR,
for example \fB\-Wimplicit\fR to request warnings on implicit
declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a
negative form beginning \fB\-Wno\-\fR to turn off warnings;
for example, \fB\-Wno\-implicit\fR.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.
.PP
The following options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced
by \s-1GCC\s0; for further, language-specific options also refer to
\&\fB\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR and \fBObjective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ Dialect
Options\fR.

.IP "\fB\-pedantic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic"
Issue all the warnings demanded by strict \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+.  For \s-1ISO\s0 C, follows the
version of the \s-1ISO\s0 C standard specified by any \fB\-std\fR option used.
.Sp
Valid \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few will require \fB\-ansi\fR or a
\&\fB\-std\fR option specifying the required version of \s-1ISO\s0 C).  However,
without this option, certain \s-1GNU\s0 extensions and traditional C and \*(C+
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
.Sp
\&\fB\-pedantic\fR does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with \fB_\|_\fR.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
.Sp
Some users try to use \fB\-pedantic\fR to check programs for strict \s-1ISO\s0
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all\-\-\-only those for which
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C \fIrequires\fR a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.
.Sp
A feature to report any failure to conform to \s-1ISO\s0 C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from \fB\-pedantic\fR.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.
.Sp
Where the standard specified with \fB\-std\fR represents a \s-1GNU\s0
extended dialect of C, such as \fBgnu89\fR or \fBgnu99\fR, there is a
corresponding \fIbase standard\fR, the version of \s-1ISO\s0 C on which the \s-1GNU\s0
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from \fB\-pedantic\fR are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It would not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified \s-1GNU\s0
C dialect, since by definition the \s-1GNU\s0 dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)

.IP "\fB\-Wfatal\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wfatal-errors"
This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.
.IP "\fB\-Wformat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wformat"
Check calls to \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes, in the \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`strfmon\*(C'\fR (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families (or other target-specific families).
Which functions are checked without format attributes having been
specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
functions without the attribute specified are disabled by
\&\fB\-ffreestanding\fR or \fB\-fno\-builtin\fR.
.Sp
The formats are checked against the format features supported by \s-1GNU\s0
libc version 2.2.  These include all \s-1ISO\s0 C90 and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some \s-1BSD\s0 and \s-1GNU\s0
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; \s-1GCC\s0 does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library's limitations.  However, if \fB\-pedantic\fR is used
with \fB\-Wformat\fR, warnings will be given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for \f(CW\*(C`strfmon\*(C'\fR formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).

that such arguments are ignored.
.Sp
Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with \fB$\fR operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to \f(CW\*(C`va_arg\*(C'\fR to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of \f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR formats, this option will suppress the

Warn about uninitialized variables which are initialized with themselves.
Note this option can only be used with the \fB\-Wuninitialized\fR option,
which in turn only works with \fB\-O1\fR and above.
.Sp
For example, \s-1GCC\s0 will warn about \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR being uninitialized in the
following snippet only when \fB\-Winit\-self\fR has been specified:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        int f()

.IP "\fB\-Wmain\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmain"
Warn if the type of \fBmain\fR is suspicious.  \fBmain\fR should be a

arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-braces\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-braces"
Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.  In
the following example, the initializer for \fBa\fR is not fully
bracketed, but that for \fBb\fR is fully bracketed.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };

.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-include\-dirs\fR (C, \*(C+, Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-include-dirs (C, , Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not exist.
.IP "\fB\-Wparentheses\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wparentheses"
Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.  Only the warning for an assignment used as
a truth value is supported when compiling \*(C+; the other warnings are
only supported when compiling C.
.Sp
Also warn if a comparison like \fBx<=y<=z\fR appears; this is
equivalent to \fB(x<=y ? 1 : 0) <= z\fR, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.
.Sp
Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
\&\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement an \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        {
\&          if (a)
\&            if (b)
\&              foo ();
\&          else
\&            bar ();
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
In C, every \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR branch belongs to the innermost possible \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR
statement, which in this example is \f(CW\*(C`if (b)\*(C'\fR.  This is often not
what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above example by
indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the potential for this
confusion, \s-1GCC\s0 will issue a warning when this flag is specified.
To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the innermost
\&\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement so there is no way the \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR could belong to
the enclosing \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR.  The resulting code would look like this:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        {
\&          if (a)
\&            {
\&              if (b)
\&                foo ();
\&              else
\&                bar ();
\&            }
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wsequence\-point\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsequence-point"
Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and \*(C+ standards.
.Sp
The C and \*(C+ standards defines the order in which expressions in a C/\*(C+
program are evaluated in terms of \fIsequence points\fR, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
\&\f(CW\*(C`&&\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`? :\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.
.Sp
It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and \*(C+ standards specify that \*(L"Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.  
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.\*(R".  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.
.Sp
Examples of code with undefined behavior are \f(CW\*(C`a = a++;\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`a[n]
= b[n++]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`a[i++] = i;\*(C'\fR.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.
.Sp
The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the \s-1GCC\s0 readings page, at
<\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html\fR>.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR for C and \*(C+.
.IP "\fB\-Wreturn\-type\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wreturn-type"
Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults to
\&\f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.  Also warn about any \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR statement with no
return-value in a function whose return-type is not \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
For C, also warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier
such as \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR.  Such a type qualifier has no effect, since the
value returned by a function is not an lvalue.  \s-1ISO\s0 C prohibits
qualified \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR return types on function definitions, so such
return types always receive a warning even without this option.
.Sp
For \*(C+, a function without return type always produces a diagnostic
message, even when \fB\-Wno\-return\-type\fR is specified.  The only
exceptions are \fBmain\fR and functions defined in system headers.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wswitch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wswitch"
Warn whenever a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  (The presence of a \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR label prevents this
warning.)  \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wswitch\-default\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wswitch-default"
Warn whenever a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement does not have a \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR
case.
.IP "\fB\-Wswitch\-enum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wswitch-enum"
Warn whenever a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.
.IP "\fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtrigraphs"
Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the meaning of
the program (trigraphs within comments are not warned about).
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-function\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-function"
Warn whenever a static function is declared but not defined or a
non-inline static function is unused.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-label\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-label"

Warn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its declaration.
.Sp
To suppress this warning use the \fBunused\fR attribute.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-variable\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-variable"
Warn whenever a local variable or non-constant static variable is unused
aside from its declaration.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.Sp
To suppress this warning use the \fBunused\fR attribute.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-value\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-value"
Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not used.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.Sp
To suppress this warning cast the expression to \fBvoid\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused"
All the above \fB\-Wunused\fR options combined.
.Sp
In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you must
either specify \fB\-Wextra \-Wunused\fR (note that \fB\-Wall\fR implies
\&\fB\-Wunused\fR), or separately specify \fB\-Wunused\-parameter\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wuninitialized\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wuninitialized"
Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized or
if a variable may be clobbered by a \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR call.
.Sp
These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
because they require data flow information that is computed only
when optimizing.  If you do not specify \fB\-O\fR, you will not get 
these warnings. Instead, \s-1GCC\s0 will issue a warning about \fB\-Wuninitialized\fR
requiring \fB\-O\fR.
.Sp
If you want to warn about code which uses the uninitialized value of the
variable in its own initializer, use the \fB\-Winit\-self\fR option.
.Sp
These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables which are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared \f(CW\*(C`volatile\*(C'\fR.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings will depend on the precise optimization
options and version of \s-1GCC\s0 used.
.Sp
Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.
.Sp
These warnings are made optional because \s-1GCC\s0 is not smart
enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&        {
\&          int x;
\&          switch (y)
\&            {
\&            case 1: x = 1;
\&              break;
\&            case 2: x = 4;
\&              break;
\&            case 3: x = 5;
\&            }
\&          foo (x);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
If the value of \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR is always 1, 2 or 3, then \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is
always initialized, but \s-1GCC\s0 doesn't know this.  Here is
another common case:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        {
\&          int save_y;
\&          if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
\&          ...
\&          if (change_y) y = save_y;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
This has no bug because \f(CW\*(C`save_y\*(C'\fR is used only if it is set.
.Sp
This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.
.Sp
The compiler sees only the calls to \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR.  It cannot know
where \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR cannot
in fact be called at the place which would cause a problem.
.Sp
Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR.  
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunknown\-pragmas\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunknown-pragmas"
Warn when a #pragma directive is encountered which is not understood by
\&\s-1GCC\s0.  If this command line option is used, warnings will even be issued
for unknown pragmas in system header files.  This is not the case if
the warnings were only enabled by the \fB\-Wall\fR command line option.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pragmas\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-pragmas"
Do not warn about misuses of pragmas, such as incorrect parameters,
invalid syntax, or conflicts between pragmas.  See also
\&\fB\-Wunknown\-pragmas\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-aliasing"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR is active.
It warns about code which might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.  The warning does not catch all
cases, but does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls.  It is
included in \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing=2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-aliasing=2"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR is active.
It warns about code which might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.  This warning catches more cases than
\&\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR, but it will also give a warning for some ambiguous
cases that are safe.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=n"
.PD
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR is active.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.
.Sp
An optimization which assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code which is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
will require, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.
.RS 4
.IP "@option<\-Wstrict\-overflow=1>" 4
.IX Item "@option<-Wstrict-overflow=1>"
Warn about cases which are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For
example: \f(CW\*(C`x + 1 > x\*(C'\fR; with \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR, the
compiler will simplify this to \f(CW1\fR.  This level of
\&\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow\fR is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR; higher levels
are not, and must be explicitly requested.
.IP "@option<\-Wstrict\-overflow=2>" 4
.IX Item "@option<-Wstrict-overflow=2>"
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a
constant.  For example: \f(CW\*(C`abs (x) >= 0\*(C'\fR.  This can only be
simplified when \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR is in effect, because
\&\f(CW\*(C`abs (INT_MIN)\*(C'\fR overflows to \f(CW\*(C`INT_MIN\*(C'\fR, which is less than
zero.  \fB\-Wstrict\-overflow\fR (with no level) is the same as
\&\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=2\fR.
.IP "@option<\-Wstrict\-overflow=3>" 4
.IX Item "@option<-Wstrict-overflow=3>"
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For
example: \f(CW\*(C`x + 1 > 1\*(C'\fR will be simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x > 0\*(C'\fR.
.IP "@option<\-Wstrict\-overflow=4>" 4
.IX Item "@option<-Wstrict-overflow=4>"
Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the above cases.
For example: \f(CW\*(C`(x * 10) / 5\*(C'\fR will be simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x * 2\*(C'\fR.
.IP "@option<\-Wstrict\-overflow=5>" 4
.IX Item "@option<-Wstrict-overflow=5>"
Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: \f(CW\*(C`x + 2 > y\*(C'\fR will
be simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x + 1 >= y\*(C'\fR.  This is reported only at the
highest warning level because this simplification applies to many
comparisons, so this warning level will give a very large number of
false positives.

.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
A function can return either with or without a value.  (Falling
off the end of the function body is considered returning without
a value.)  For example, this function would evoke such a
warning:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        foo (a)

\&          if (a > 0)
\&            return a;

.IP "*" 4
An expression-statement or the left-hand side of a comma expression
contains no side effects.
To suppress the warning, cast the unused expression to void.
For example, an expression such as \fBx[i,j]\fR will cause a warning,
but \fBx[(void)i,j]\fR will not.
.IP "*" 4
An unsigned value is compared against zero with \fB<\fR or \fB>=\fR.
.IP "*" 4
Storage-class specifiers like \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR are not the first things in

A comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an
incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.

obtaining infinities and NaNs.
.IP "\fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsystem-headers"
Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.
Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command line option tells
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user
code.  However, note that using \fB\-Wall\fR in conjunction with this
option will \fInot\fR warn about unknown pragmas in system

.IP "\fB\-Wfloat\-equal\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wfloat-equal"
Warn if floating point values are used in equality comparisons.
.Sp
The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
would check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.
.IP "\fB\-Wtraditional\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wtraditional (C only)"
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C.  Also warn about \s-1ISO\s0 C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs which should be avoided.
.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,

.IP "*" 4
In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors would only consider a line to be a directive
if the \fB#\fR appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR warns about directives that traditional C
understands but would ignore because the \fB#\fR does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
\&\fB#pragma\fR not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations would not recognize \fB#elif\fR, so it
suggests avoiding it altogether.
.IP "*" 4
A function-like macro that appears without arguments.
.IP "*" 4
The unary plus operator.
.IP "*" 4
The \fBU\fR integer constant suffix, or the \fBF\fR or \fBL\fR floating point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the \fBL\fR suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the \fB_MIN\fR/\fB_MAX\fR macros in \f(CW\*(C`<limits.h>\*(C'\fR.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however \s-1GCC\s0's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.

A non\-\f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR function declaration follows a \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.
.IP "*" 4
The \s-1ISO\s0 type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.
.IP "*" 4
Usage of \s-1ISO\s0 string concatenation is detected.
.IP "*" 4
Initialization of automatic aggregates.
.IP "*" 4
Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.
.IP "*" 4
Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STDC_\|_\*(C'\fR to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.
.IP "*" 4
Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C would cause serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings, for the full set use \fB\-Wconversion\fR.
.IP "*" 4
Use of \s-1ISO\s0 C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
\&\fInot\fR issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these \s-1ISO\s0 C features will appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, \f(CW\*(C`PARAMS\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`VPARAMS\*(C'\fR.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a \s-1GCC\s0 extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

.IP "\fB\-Wdeclaration\-after\-statement\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wdeclaration-after-statement (C only)"
Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.  This
construct, known from \*(C+, was introduced with \s-1ISO\s0 C99 and is by default
allowed in \s-1GCC\s0.  It is not supported by \s-1ISO\s0 C90 and was not supported by
\&\s-1GCC\s0 versions before \s-1GCC\s0 3.0.  
.IP "\fB\-Wundef\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wundef"
Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an \fB#if\fR directive.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-endif\-labels\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-endif-labels"
Do not warn whenever an \fB#else\fR or an \fB#endif\fR are followed by text.
.IP "\fB\-Wshadow\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wshadow"
Warn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable, parameter or
global variable or whenever a built-in function is shadowed.
.IP "\fB\-Wlarger\-than\-\fR\fIlen\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlarger-than-len"
Warn whenever an object of larger than \fIlen\fR bytes is defined.
.IP "\fB\-Wunsafe\-loop\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations"
Warn if the loop cannot be optimized because the compiler could not
assume anything on the bounds of the loop indices.  With
\&\fB\-funsafe\-loop\-optimizations\fR warn if the compiler made
such assumptions.
.IP "\fB\-Wpointer\-arith\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpointer-arith"
Warn about anything that depends on the \*(L"size of\*(R" a function type or
of \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR.  \s-1GNU\s0 C assigns these types a size of 1, for
convenience in calculations with \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR pointers and pointers
to functions.
.IP "\fB\-Wbad\-function\-cast\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wbad-function-cast (C only)"
Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type.
For example, warn if \f(CW\*(C`int malloc()\*(C'\fR is cast to \f(CW\*(C`anything *\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wc++\-compat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wc++-compat"
Warn about \s-1ISO\s0 C constructs that are outside of the common subset of
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+, e.g. request for implicit conversion from
\&\f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR to a pointer to non\-\f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR type.
.IP "\fB\-Wcast\-qual\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcast-qual"
Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from
the target type.  For example, warn if a \f(CW\*(C`const char *\*(C'\fR is cast
to an ordinary \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wcast\-align\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcast-align"
Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the
target is increased.  For example, warn if a \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR is cast to
an \f(CW\*(C`int *\*(C'\fR on machines where integers can only be accessed at
two\- or four-byte boundaries.
.IP "\fB\-Wwrite\-strings\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wwrite-strings"
When compiling C, give string constants the type \f(CW\*(C`const
char[\f(CIlength\f(CW]\*(C'\fR so that
copying the address of one into a non\-\f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR
pointer will get a warning; when compiling \*(C+, warn about the
deprecated conversion from string literals to \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR.  This
warning, by default, is enabled for \*(C+ programs.
These warnings will help you find at
compile time code that can try to write into a string constant, but
only if you have been very careful about using \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR in
declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance;
this is why we did not make \fB\-Wall\fR request these warnings.
.IP "\fB\-Wconversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wconversion"
Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what
would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This
includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and
conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed point argument
except when the same as the default promotion.
.Sp
Also, warn if a negative integer constant expression is implicitly
converted to an unsigned type.  For example, warn about the assignment
\&\f(CW\*(C`x = \-1\*(C'\fR if \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is unsigned.  But do not warn about explicit
casts like \f(CW\*(C`(unsigned) \-1\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wsign\-compare\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsign-compare"
Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce
an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
This warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR; to get the other warnings
of \fB\-Wextra\fR without this warning, use \fB\-Wextra \-Wno\-sign\-compare\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Waddress\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Waddress"
Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These include using
the address of a function in a conditional expression, such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`void func(void); if (func)\*(C'\fR, and comparisons against the memory
address of a string literal, such as \f(CW\*(C`if (x == "abc")\*(C'\fR.  Such
uses typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a function
always evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function
call; and comparisons against string literals result in unspecified
behavior and are not portable in C, so they usually indicate that the
programmer intended to use \f(CW\*(C`strcmp\*(C'\fR.  This warning is enabled by
\&\fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Waggregate\-return\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Waggregate-return"
Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or
called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also elicits
a warning.)
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-attributes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-attributes"
Do not warn if an unexpected \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_\*(C'\fR is used, such as
unrecognized attributes, function attributes applied to variables,
etc.  This will not stop errors for incorrect use of supported
attributes.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-prototypes\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-prototypes (C only)"
Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted without
a warning if preceded by a declaration which specifies the argument
types.)
.IP "\fB\-Wold\-style\-definition\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wold-style-definition (C only)"
Warn if an old-style function definition is used.  A warning is given
even if there is a previous prototype.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-prototypes\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-prototypes (C only)"
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
provides a prototype.  The aim is to detect global functions that fail
to be declared in header files.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-declarations\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-declarations (C only)"
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.
Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype.
Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
header files.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-field\-initializers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-field-initializers"
Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For
example, the following code would cause such a warning, because
\&\f(CW\*(C`x.h\*(C'\fR is implicitly zero:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct s { int f, g, h; };
\&        struct s x = { 3, 4 };
.Ve
.Sp
This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following
modification would not trigger a warning:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct s { int f, g, h; };
\&        struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };
.Ve
.Sp
This warning is included in \fB\-Wextra\fR.  To get other \fB\-Wextra\fR
warnings without this one, use \fB\-Wextra \-Wno\-missing\-field\-initializers\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-noreturn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-noreturn"
Warn about functions which might be candidates for attribute \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR.
Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.  Care should
be taken to manually verify functions actually do not ever return before
adding the \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR attribute, otherwise subtle code generation
bugs could be introduced.  You will not get a warning for \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR in
hosted C environments.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-format\-attribute\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-format-attribute"
Warn about function pointers which might be candidates for \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR
attributes.  Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.
\&\s-1GCC\s0 will guess that function pointers with \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR attributes that
are used in assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return
statements should have a corresponding \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR attribute in the
resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or
initialization, the type of the parameter variable, or the return type
of the containing function respectively should also have a \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR
attribute to avoid the warning.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 will also warn about function definitions which might be
candidates for \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR attributes.  Again, these are only
possible candidates.  \s-1GCC\s0 will guess that \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR attributes
might be appropriate for any function that calls a function like
\&\f(CW\*(C`vprintf\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`vscanf\*(C'\fR, but this might not always be the
case, and some functions for which \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR attributes are
appropriate may not be detected.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-multichar\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-multichar"
Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (\fB'\s-1FOOF\s0'\fR) is used.
Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable code.
.IP "\fB\-Wnormalized=<none|id|nfc|nfkc>\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wnormalized=<none|id|nfc|nfkc>"
In \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+, two identifiers are different if they are
different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic \s-1ASCII\s0 character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the \s-1ISO\s0 10646 standard sets out some \fInormalization rules\fR which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  \s-1GCC\s0 can warn you if you are using identifiers which
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.
.Sp
There are four levels of warning that \s-1GCC\s0 supports.  The default is
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=nfc\fR, which warns about any identifier which is
not in the \s-1ISO\s0 10646 \*(L"C\*(R" normalized form, \fI\s-1NFC\s0\fR.  \s-1NFC\s0 is the
recommended form for most uses.
.Sp
Unfortunately, there are some characters which \s-1ISO\s0 C and \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ allow
in identifiers that when turned into \s-1NFC\s0 aren't allowable as
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C or \*(C+ and have all your identifiers in \s-1NFC\s0.
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=id\fR suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.
.Sp
You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=none\fR.  You would only want to do this if you
were using some other normalization scheme (like \*(L"D\*(R"), because
otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.
.Sp
Some characters in \s-1ISO\s0 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance \f(CW\*(C`\eu207F\*(C'\fR, \*(L"\s-1SUPERSCRIPT\s0 \s-1LATIN\s0 \s-1SMALL\s0
\&\s-1LETTER\s0 N\*(R", will display just like a regular \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR which has been
placed in a superscript.  \s-1ISO\s0 10646 defines the \fI\s-1NFKC\s0\fR
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and \s-1GCC\s0 will warn if your code is not in \s-1NFKC\s0 if you use
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=nfkc\fR.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment is
unable to be fixed to display these characters distinctly.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-deprecated\-declarations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-deprecated-declarations"
Do not warn about uses of functions,
variables, and types marked as deprecated by using the \f(CW\*(C`deprecated\*(C'\fR
attribute.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-overflow\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-overflow"
Do not warn about compile-time overflow in constant expressions.
.IP "\fB\-Woverride\-init\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Woverride-init"
Warn if an initialized field without side effects is overridden when
using designated initializers.
.Sp
This warning is included in \fB\-Wextra\fR.  To get other
\&\fB\-Wextra\fR warnings without this one, use \fB\-Wextra
\&\-Wno\-override\-init\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wpacked\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpacked"
Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable \f(CW\*(C`f.x\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`struct bar\*(C'\fR
will be misaligned even though \f(CW\*(C`struct bar\*(C'\fR does not itself
have the packed attribute:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&        struct foo {
\&          int x;
\&          char a, b, c, d;
\&        } __attribute__((packed));
\&        struct bar {
\&          char z;
\&          struct foo f;
\&        };
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wpadded\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpadded"
Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.
.IP "\fB\-Wredundant\-decls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wredundant-decls"
Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in
cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.
.IP "\fB\-Wnested\-externs\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wnested-externs (C only)"
Warn if an \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR declaration is encountered within a function.
.IP "\fB\-Wunreachable\-code\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunreachable-code"
Warn if the compiler detects that code will never be executed.
.Sp
This option is intended to warn when the compiler detects that at
least a whole line of source code will never be executed, because
some condition is never satisfied or because it is after a
procedure that never returns.
.Sp
It is possible for this option to produce a warning even though there
are circumstances under which part of the affected line can be executed,
so care should be taken when removing apparently-unreachable code.
.Sp
For instance, when a function is inlined, a warning may mean that the
line is unreachable in only one inlined copy of the function.
.Sp
This option is not made part of \fB\-Wall\fR because in a debugging
version of a program there is often substantial code which checks
correct functioning of the program and is, hopefully, unreachable
because the program does work.  Another common use of unreachable
code is to provide behavior which is selectable at compile\-time.
.IP "\fB\-Winline\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Winline"
Warn if a function can not be inlined and it was declared as inline.
Even with this option, the compiler will not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.
.Sp
The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by \fB\-Winline\fR to appear or disappear.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-invalid\-offsetof\fR (\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-invalid-offsetof ( only)"
Suppress warnings from applying the \fBoffsetof\fR macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 1998 \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ standard, applying \fBoffsetof\fR
to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing \*(C+ implementations,
however, \fBoffsetof\fR typically gives meaningful results even when
applied to certain kinds of non-POD types. (Such as a simple
\&\fBstruct\fR that fails to be a \s-1POD\s0 type only by virtue of having a
constructor.)  This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.
.Sp
The restrictions on \fBoffsetof\fR may be relaxed in a future version
of the \*(C+ standard.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-int\-to\-pointer\-cast\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast (C only)"
Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of a
different size.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pointer\-to\-int\-cast\fR (C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast (C only)"
Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer type of a
different size.
.IP "\fB\-Winvalid\-pch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Winvalid-pch"
Warn if a precompiled header is found in
the search path but can't be used.
.IP "\fB\-Wlong\-long\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlong-long"
Warn if \fBlong long\fR type is used.  This is default.  To inhibit
the warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-long\-long\fR.  Flags
\&\fB\-Wlong\-long\fR and \fB\-Wno\-long\-long\fR are taken into account
only when \fB\-pedantic\fR flag is used.
.IP "\fB\-Wvariadic\-macros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvariadic-macros"
Warn if variadic macros are used in pedantic \s-1ISO\s0 C90 mode, or the \s-1GNU\s0
alternate syntax when in pedantic \s-1ISO\s0 C99 mode.  This is default.
To inhibit the warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-variadic\-macros\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wvolatile\-register\-var\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvolatile-register-var"
Warn if a register variable is declared volatile.  The volatile
modifier does not inhibit all optimizations that may eliminate reads
and/or writes to register variables.
.IP "\fB\-Wdisabled\-optimization\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wdisabled-optimization"
Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that \s-1GCC\s0's optimizers were unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; \s-1GCC\s0 will refuse to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.
.IP "\fB\-Wpointer\-sign\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpointer-sign"
Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
This option is only supported for C and Objective\-C.  It is implied by
\&\fB\-Wall\fR and by \fB\-pedantic\fR, which can be disabled with
\&\fB\-Wno\-pointer\-sign\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Werror\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror"
Make all warnings into errors.
.IP "\fB\-Werror=\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror="
Make the specified warning into an errors.  The specifier for a
warning is appended, for example \fB\-Werror=switch\fR turns the
warnings controlled by \fB\-Wswitch\fR into errors.  This switch
takes a negative form, to be used to negate \fB\-Werror\fR for
specific warnings, for example \fB\-Wno\-error=switch\fR makes
\&\fB\-Wswitch\fR warnings not be errors, even when \fB\-Werror\fR
is in effect.  You can use the \fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-option\fR
option to have each controllable warning amended with the option which
controls it, to determine what to use with this option.
.Sp
Note that specifying \fB\-Werror=\fR\fIfoo\fR automatically implies
\&\fB\-W\fR\fIfoo\fR.  However, \fB\-Wno\-error=\fR\fIfoo\fR does not
imply anything.
.IP "\fB\-Wstack\-protector\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstack-protector"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstack\-protector\fR is active.  It
warns about functions that will not be protected against stack smashing.
.IP "\fB\-Woverlength\-strings\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Woverlength-strings"
Warn about string constants which are longer than the \*(L"minimum
maximum\*(R" length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants which are much longer than the
standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.
.Sp
The limit applies \fIafter\fR string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing \s-1NUL\s0.  In C89, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  \*(C+98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in \*(C+.
.Sp
This option is implied by \fB\-pedantic\fR, and can be disabled with
\&\fB\-Wno\-overlength\-strings\fR.
.Sh "Options for Debugging Your Program or \s-1GCC\s0"
.IX Subsection "Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC"
\&\s-1GCC\s0 has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or \s-1GCC:\s0
.IP "\fB\-g\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g"
Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, \s-1COFF\s0, \s-1XCOFF\s0, or \s-1DWARF\s0 2).  \s-1GDB\s0 can work with this debugging
information.
.Sp
On most systems that use stabs format, \fB\-g\fR enables use of extra
debugging information that only \s-1GDB\s0 can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in \s-1GDB\s0 but will probably make other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use \fB\-gstabs+\fR, \fB\-gstabs\fR,
\&\fB\-gxcoff+\fR, \fB\-gxcoff\fR, or \fB\-gvms\fR (see below).
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 allows you to use \fB\-g\fR with
\&\fB\-O\fR.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.
.Sp
Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
.Sp
The following options are useful when \s-1GCC\s0 is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.
.IP "\fB\-ggdb\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ggdb"
Produce debugging information for use by \s-1GDB\s0.  This means to use the
most expressive format available (\s-1DWARF\s0 2, stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including \s-1GDB\s0 extensions if at all
possible.
.IP "\fB\-gstabs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstabs"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without \s-1GDB\s0 extensions.  This is the format used by \s-1DBX\s0 on most \s-1BSD\s0
systems.  On \s-1MIPS\s0, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output which is not understood by \s-1DBX\s0 or \s-1SDB\s0.
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the \s-1GNU\s0 assembler.
.IP "\fB\-feliminate\-unused\-debug\-symbols\fR" 4
.IX Item "-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
for only symbols that are actually used.
.IP "\fB\-femit\-class\-debug\-always\fR" 4
.IX Item "-femit-class-debug-always"
Instead of emitting debugging information for a \*(C+ class in only one
object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This option
should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way \s-1GCC\s0
normally emits debugging information for classes because using this
option will increase the size of debugging information by as much as a
factor of two.
.IP "\fB\-gstabs+\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstabs+"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions understood only by the \s-1GNU\s0 debugger (\s-1GDB\s0).  The

Request debugging information and also use \fIlevel\fR to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.
.Sp
Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.
.Sp
Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use \fB\-g3\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-gdwarf\-2\fR does not accept a concatenated debug level, because
\&\s-1GCC\s0 used to support an option \fB\-gdwarf\fR that meant to generate
debug information in version 1 of the \s-1DWARF\s0 format (which is very
different from version 2), and it would have been too confusing.  That
debug format is long obsolete, but the option cannot be changed now.
Instead use an additional \fB\-g\fR\fIlevel\fR option to change the
debug level for \s-1DWARF2\s0.

Add code so that program flow \fIarcs\fR are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
\&\fI\fIauxname\fI.gcda\fR for each source file.  The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (\fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR), or for
test coverage analysis (\fB\-ftest\-coverage\fR).  Each object file's
\&\fIauxname\fR is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g. \fIfoo.gcda\fR for input file \fIdir/foo.c\fR, or
\&\fIdir/foo.gcda\fR for output file specified as \fB\-o dir/foo.o\fR).

Link your object files with \fB\-lgcov\fR or \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR

Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile

concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system
supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.  Also
\&\f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR calls are detected and correctly handled (double counting
will not happen).

With \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, for each function of your program \s-1GCC\s0
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph.
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.

This option controls the amount of debugging output the vectorizer prints.
This information is written to standard error, unless 
\&\fB\-fdump\-tree\-all\fR or \fB\-fdump\-tree\-vect\fR is specified, 
in which case it is output to the usual dump listing file, \fI.vect\fR.
For \fIn\fR=0 no diagnostic information is reported.
If \fIn\fR=1 the vectorizer reports each loop that got vectorized, 
and the total number of loops that got vectorized.
If \fIn\fR=2 the vectorizer also reports non-vectorized loops that passed 
the first analysis phase (vect_analyze_loop_form) \- i.e. countable, 
inner\-most, single\-bb, single\-entry/exit loops.  This is the same verbosity 
level that \fB\-fdump\-tree\-vect\-stats\fR uses.
Higher verbosity levels mean either more information dumped for each 
reported loop, or same amount of information reported for more loops:
If \fIn\fR=3, alignment related information is added to the reports.
If \fIn\fR=4, data-references related information (e.g. memory dependences, 
memory access\-patterns) is added to the reports.
If \fIn\fR=5, the vectorizer reports also non-vectorized inner-most loops 
that did not pass the first analysis phase (i.e. may not be countable, or 
may have complicated control\-flow).
If \fIn\fR=6, the vectorizer reports also non-vectorized nested loops.
For \fIn\fR=7, all the information the vectorizer generates during its 
analysis and transformation is reported.  This is the same verbosity level
that \fB\-fdump\-tree\-vect\-details\fR uses.
.IP "\fB\-frandom\-seed=\fR\fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frandom-seed=string"
This option provides a seed that \s-1GCC\s0 uses when it would otherwise use
random numbers.  It is used to generate certain symbol names
that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used to
place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that
produce them.  You can use the \fB\-frandom\-seed\fR option to produce
reproducibly identical object files.
.Sp
The \fIstring\fR should be different for every file you compile.
.IP "\fB\-fsched\-verbose=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsched-verbose=n"
On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the
amount of debugging output the scheduler prints.  This information is
written to standard error, unless \fB\-dS\fR or \fB\-dR\fR is
specified, in which case it is output to the usual dump
listing file, \fI.sched\fR or \fI.sched2\fR respectively.  However
for \fIn\fR greater than nine, the output is always printed to standard
error.
.Sp
For \fIn\fR greater than zero, \fB\-fsched\-verbose\fR outputs the
same information as \fB\-dRS\fR.  For \fIn\fR greater than one, it
also output basic block probabilities, detailed ready list information
and unit/insn info.  For \fIn\fR greater than two, it includes \s-1RTL\s0
at abort point, control-flow and regions info.  And for \fIn\fR over
four, \fB\-fsched\-verbose\fR also includes dependence info.
.IP "\fB\-save\-temps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-save-temps"
Store the usual \*(L"temporary\*(R" intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling \fIfoo.c\fR with \fB\-c \-save\-temps\fR would produce files
\&\fIfoo.i\fR and \fIfoo.s\fR, as well as \fIfoo.o\fR.  This creates a
preprocessed \fIfoo.i\fR output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.
.Sp
When used in combination with the \fB\-x\fR command line option,
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using \fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.IP "\fB\-time\fR" 4
.IX Item "-time"
Report the \s-1CPU\s0 time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler

.Sp
.Vb 2

.Ve
.Sp
The first number on each line is the \*(L"user time\*(R", that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is \*(L"system time\*(R",
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program.
Both numbers are in seconds.
.IP "\fB\-fvar\-tracking\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvar-tracking"
Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored at each

(if the debugging information format supports this information).
.Sp
It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (\fB\-Os\fR,
\&\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, ...), debugging information (\fB\-g\fR) and
the debug info format supports it.
.IP "\fB\-print\-file\-name=\fR\fIlibrary\fR" 4

.Sp
This is useful when \fBgcc\fR prints the error message
\&\fBinstallation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory\fR.

.IP "\fB\-feliminate\-unused\-debug\-types\fR" 4
.IX Item "-feliminate-unused-debug-types"
Normally, when producing \s-1DWARF2\s0 output, \s-1GCC\s0 will emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit.  Sometimes this is useful, such as
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.
With this option, \s-1GCC\s0 will avoid producing debug symbol output
for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.
.Sh "Options That Control Optimization"
.IX Subsection "Options That Control Optimization"
These options control various sorts of optimizations.
.PP
Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.
.PP
Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
.PP
The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of
the program.  Optimization levels \fB\-O\fR and above, in
particular, enable \fIunit-at-a-time\fR mode, which allows the
compiler to consider information gained from later functions in
the file when compiling a function.  Compiling multiple files at
once to a single output file in \fIunit-at-a-time\fR mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when
compiling each of them.
.PP
Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed.
.IP "\fB\-O\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-O1\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O1"
.PD
Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.
.Sp
With \fB\-O\fR, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.
.Sp
\&\fB\-O\fR turns on the following optimization flags:
\&\fB\-fdefer\-pop

.Sp
\&\fB\-O\fR also turns on \fB\-fomit\-frame\-pointer\fR on machines
where doing so does not interfere with debugging.
.IP "\fB\-O2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O2"
Optimize even more.  \s-1GCC\s0 performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The compiler does not
perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify \fB\-O2\fR.
As compared to \fB\-O\fR, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.
.Sp
\&\fB\-O2\fR turns on all optimization flags specified by \fB\-O\fR.  It
also turns on the following optimization flags:
\&\fB\-fthread\-jumps 
\&\-fcrossjumping

.Sp
\&\fB\-O2\fR doesn't turn on \fB\-ftree\-vrp\fR for the Ada compiler.
This option must be explicitly specified on the command line to be

.IP "\fB\-O3\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O3"
Optimize yet more.  \fB\-O3\fR turns on all optimizations specified by

\&\fB\-funswitch\-loops\fR and \fB\-fgcse\-after\-reload\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-O0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O0"
Do not optimize.  This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-Os\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Os"
Optimize for size.  \fB\-Os\fR enables all \fB\-O2\fR optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
optimizations designed to reduce code size.
.Sp
\&\fB\-Os\fR disables the following optimization flags:
\&\fB\-falign\-functions  \-falign\-jumps  \-falign\-loops 
\&\-falign\-labels  \-freorder\-blocks  \-freorder\-blocks\-and\-partition 
\&\-fprefetch\-loop\-arrays  \-ftree\-vect\-loop\-version\fR
.Sp
If you use multiple \fB\-O\fR options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.
.PP
Options of the form \fB\-f\fR\fIflag\fR specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of \fB\-ffoo\fR would be \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed\-\-\-the one you typically will
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing \fBno\-\fR
or adding it.
.PP
The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by \fB\-O\fR options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when \*(L"fine\-tuning\*(R" of
optimizations to be performed is desired.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-default\-inline\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-default-inline"
Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (\*(C+ only).  Otherwise, when you specify
\&\fB\-O\fR, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled
inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add \fBinline\fR in front of
the member function name.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-defer\-pop\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-defer-pop"
Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.
.Sp
Disabled at levels \fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fforce\-mem\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fforce-mem"
Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing
arithmetic on them.  This produces better code by making all memory
references potential common subexpressions.  When they are not common
subexpressions, instruction combination should eliminate the separate
register\-load. This option is now a nop and will be removed in 4.3.
.IP "\fB\-fforce\-addr\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fforce-addr"
Force memory address constants to be copied into registers before
doing arithmetic on them.
.IP "\fB\-fomit\-frame\-pointer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fomit-frame-pointer"
Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  \fBIt also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.\fR
.Sp
On some machines, such as the \s-1VAX\s0, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro \f(CW\*(C`FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED\*(C'\fR controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.

Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
integrating in this way.

Inline functions marked by \f(CW\*(C`always_inline\*(C'\fR and functions whose body seems
smaller than the function call overhead early before doing
\&\fB\-fprofile\-generate\fR instrumentation and real inlining pass.  Doing so

having large chains of nested wrapper functions.
.Sp
Enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-finline\-limit=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finline-limit=n"
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows the control of this limit for functions that are explicitly marked as
inline (i.e., marked with the inline keyword or defined within the class
definition in c++).  \fIn\fR is the size of functions that can be inlined in
number of pseudo instructions (not counting parameter handling).  The default
value of \fIn\fR is 600.
Increasing this value can result in more inlined code at
the cost of compilation time and memory consumption.  Decreasing usually makes
the compilation faster and less code will be inlined (which presumably
means slower programs).  This option is particularly useful for programs that
use inlining heavily such as those based on recursive templates with \*(C+.
.Sp
Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using \fB\-\-param\fR \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR.

.IP "\fB\-fmerge\-all\-constants\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmerge-all-constants"
Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.
.Sp
This option implies \fB\-fmerge\-constants\fR.  In addition to
\&\fB\-fmerge\-constants\fR this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating point
types.  Languages like C or \*(C+ require each non-automatic variable to
have distinct location, so using this option will result in non-conforming
behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fmodulo\-sched\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmodulo-sched"
Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling
pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders their
instructions by overlapping different iterations.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-branch\-count\-reg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-branch-count-reg"
Do not use \*(L"decrement and branch\*(R" instructions on a count register,
but instead generate a sequence of instructions that decrement a
register, compare it against zero, then branch based upon the result.
This option is only meaningful on architectures that support such
instructions, which include x86, PowerPC, \s-1IA\-64\s0 and S/390.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fbranch\-count\-reg\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-function\-cse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-function-cse"
Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.
.Sp
This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-ffunction\-cse\fR
.IP "\fB\-fno\-zero\-initialized\-in\-bss\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss"
If the target supports a \s-1BSS\s0 section, \s-1GCC\s0 by default puts variables that
are initialized to zero into \s-1BSS\s0.  This can save space in the resulting
code.
.Sp
This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section.  E.g., so that the
resulting executable can find the beginning of that section and/or make
assumptions based on that.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fzero\-initialized\-in\-bss\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fbounds\-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fbounds-check"
For front-ends that support it, generate additional code to check that
indices used to access arrays are within the declared range.  This is
currently only supported by the Java and Fortran front\-ends, where
this option defaults to true and false respectively.
.IP "\fB\-fmudflap \-fmudflapth \-fmudflapir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmudflap -fmudflapth -fmudflapir"
For front-ends that support it (C and \*(C+), instrument all risky
pointer/array dereferencing operations, some standard library
string/heap functions, and some other associated constructs with
range/validity tests.  Modules so instrumented should be immune to
buffer overflows, invalid heap use, and some other classes of C/\*(C+
programming errors.  The instrumentation relies on a separate runtime
library (\fIlibmudflap\fR), which will be linked into a program if
\&\fB\-fmudflap\fR is given at link time.  Run-time behavior of the
instrumented program is controlled by the \fB\s-1MUDFLAP_OPTIONS\s0\fR
environment variable.  See \f(CW\*(C`env MUDFLAP_OPTIONS=\-help a.out\*(C'\fR
for its options.
.Sp
Use \fB\-fmudflapth\fR instead of \fB\-fmudflap\fR to compile and to
link if your program is multi\-threaded.  Use \fB\-fmudflapir\fR, in
addition to \fB\-fmudflap\fR or \fB\-fmudflapth\fR, if
instrumentation should ignore pointer reads.  This produces less
instrumentation (and therefore faster execution) and still provides
some protection against outright memory corrupting writes, but allows
erroneously read data to propagate within a program.
.IP "\fB\-fthread\-jumps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fthread-jumps"
Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump branches to a
location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
the condition is known to be true or false.

.IP "\fB\-fcse\-follow\-jumps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcse-follow-jumps"
In common subexpression elimination, scan through jump instructions
when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
example, when \s-1CSE\s0 encounters an \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement with an
\&\f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR clause, \s-1CSE\s0 will follow the jump when the condition
tested is false.

.IP "\fB\-fcse\-skip\-blocks\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcse-skip-blocks"
This is similar to \fB\-fcse\-follow\-jumps\fR, but causes \s-1CSE\s0 to
follow jumps which conditionally skip over blocks.  When \s-1CSE\s0
encounters a simple \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement with no else clause,
\&\fB\-fcse\-skip\-blocks\fR causes \s-1CSE\s0 to follow the jump around the

Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass.
This pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.
.Sp
\&\fINote:\fR When compiling a program using computed gotos, a \s-1GCC\s0

Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-lm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-lm"
When \fB\-fgcse\-lm\fR is enabled, global common subexpression elimination will
attempt to move loads which are only killed by stores into themselves.  This
allows a loop containing a load/store sequence to be changed to a load outside
the loop, and a copy/store within the loop.
.Sp
Enabled by default when gcse is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-sm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-sm"
When \fB\-fgcse\-sm\fR is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
global common subexpression elimination.  This pass will attempt to move
stores out of loops.  When used in conjunction with \fB\-fgcse\-lm\fR,
loops containing a load/store sequence can be changed to a load before
the loop and a store after the loop.
.Sp
Not enabled at any optimization level.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-las\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-las"
When \fB\-fgcse\-las\fR is enabled, the global common subexpression
elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come after stores to the
same memory location (both partial and full redundancies).
.Sp
Not enabled at any optimization level.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-after\-reload\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-after-reload"
When \fB\-fgcse\-after\-reload\fR is enabled, a redundant load elimination
pass is performed after reload.  The purpose of this pass is to cleanup
redundant spilling.
.IP "\fB\-funsafe\-loop\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funsafe-loop-optimizations"
If given, the loop optimizer will assume that loop indices do not
overflow, and that the loops with nontrivial exit condition are not
infinite.  This enables a wider range of loop optimizations even if
the loop optimizer itself cannot prove that these assumptions are valid.
Using \fB\-Wunsafe\-loop\-optimizations\fR, the compiler will warn you
if it finds this kind of loop.

Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.  This

.IP "\fB\-fdelete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdelete-null-pointer-checks"
Use global dataflow analysis to identify and eliminate useless checks
for null pointers.  The compiler assumes that dereferencing a null
pointer would have halted the program.  If a pointer is checked after
it has already been dereferenced, it cannot be null.

In some environments, this assumption is not true, and programs can
safely dereference null pointers.  Use

.IX Item "-fschedule-insns"
If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to
eliminate execution stalls due to required data being unavailable.  This
helps machines that have slow floating point or memory load instructions

.IP "\fB\-fschedule\-insns2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fschedule-insns2"
Similar to \fB\-fschedule\-insns\fR, but requests an additional pass of
instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.  This is
especially useful on machines with a relatively small number of

.IP "\fB\-fsched2\-use\-superblocks\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsched2-use-superblocks"
When scheduling after register allocation, do use superblock scheduling
algorithm.  Superblock scheduling allows motion across basic block boundaries
resulting on faster schedules.  This option is experimental, as not all machine
descriptions used by \s-1GCC\s0 model the \s-1CPU\s0 closely enough to avoid unreliable
results from the algorithm.

This mode should produce faster but significantly longer programs.  Also
without \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR the traces constructed may not

.IX Item "-ftree-fre"
Perform Full Redundancy Elimination (\s-1FRE\s0) on trees.  The difference
between \s-1FRE\s0 and \s-1PRE\s0 is that \s-1FRE\s0 only considers expressions
that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation.
This analysis faster than \s-1PRE\s0, though it exposes fewer redundancies.
This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-copy\-prop\fR" 4

Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy

performs jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps). This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ch"
Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases
effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag
is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.  It is not enabled

.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-im\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-im"
Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that
would be hard to handle at \s-1RTL\s0 level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns).  With \fB\-funswitch\-loops\fR it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use
just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
store motion.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-ivcanon\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-ivcanon"
Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in the loop for that

Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction, induction
variable merging and induction variable elimination) on trees.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-sra\fR" 4

Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.  This pass replaces structure
references with scalars to prevent committing structures to memory too
early.  This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-copyrename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-copyrename"
Perform copy renaming on trees.  This pass attempts to rename compiler
temporaries to other variables at copy locations, usually resulting in
variable names which more closely resemble the original variables.  This flag
is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ter\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ter"
Perform temporary expression replacement during the \s-1SSA\-\s0>normal phase.  Single
use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use location with their
defining expression.  This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders
much more complex trees to work on resulting in better \s-1RTL\s0 generation.  This is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-lrs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-lrs"
Perform live range splitting during the \s-1SSA\-\s0>normal phase.  Distinct live

Perform loop vectorization on trees.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-vect\-loop\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-vect-loop-version"
Perform loop versioning when doing loop vectorization on trees.  When a loop
appears to be vectorizable except that data alignment or data dependence cannot
be determined at compile time then vectorized and non-vectorized versions of
the loop are generated along with runtime checks for alignment or dependence
to control which version is executed.  This option is enabled by default
except at level \fB\-Os\fR where it is disabled.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-vrp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-vrp"
Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are
propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is

elimination is only done if \fB\-fdelete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR is

Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile

.IP "\fB\-fsplit\-ivs\-in\-unroller\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller"
Enables expressing of values of induction variables in later iterations
of the unrolled loop using the value in the first iteration.  This breaks
long dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.
.Sp
Combination of \fB\-fweb\fR and \s-1CSE\s0 is often sufficient to obtain the
same effect.  However in cases the loop body is more complicated than
a single basic block, this is not reliable.  It also does not work at all

heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch probabilities
are specified by \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR, then the heuristics will be
used to guess branch probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph,
taking the \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR info into account.  The interactions
between the heuristics and \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR can be complex, and in
some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects

.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-aliasing"
Allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and \*(C+), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an \f(CW\*(C`unsigned int\*(C'\fR can alias an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR, but not a
\&\f(CW\*(C`void*\*(C'\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR.  A character type may alias any other
type.
.Sp
Pay special attention to code like this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        union a_union {
\&          int i;
\&          double d;

\&          t.d = 3.0;
\&          return t.i;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called \*(L"type\-punning\*(R") is common.  Even with
\&\fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above will work as
expected.  However, this code might not:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        int f() {
\&          a_union t;
\&          int* ip;
\&          t.d = 3.0;
\&          ip = &t.i;
\&          return *ip;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Every language that wishes to perform language-specific alias analysis
should define a function that computes, given an \f(CW\*(C`tree\*(C'\fR
node, an alias set for the node.  Nodes in different alias sets are not
allowed to alias.  For an example, see the C front-end function
\&\f(CW\*(C`c_get_alias_set\*(C'\fR.

.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-overflow"
Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules, depending
on the language being compiled.  For C (and \*(C+) this means that
overflow when doing arithmetic with signed numbers is undefined, which
means that the compiler may assume that it will not happen.  This
permits various optimizations.  For example, the compiler will assume
that an expression like \f(CW\*(C`i + 10 > i\*(C'\fR will always be true for
signed \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR.  This assumption is only valid if signed overflow is
undefined, as the expression is false if \f(CW\*(C`i + 10\*(C'\fR overflows when
using twos complement arithmetic.  When this option is in effect any
attempt to determine whether an operation on signed numbers will
overflow must be written carefully to not actually involve overflow.
.Sp
See also the \fB\-fwrapv\fR option.  Using \fB\-fwrapv\fR means
that signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps.  When
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR is used, there is no difference between
\&\fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR and \fB\-fno\-strict\-overflow\fR.  With
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR certain types of overflow are permitted.  For
example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing arithmetic on
constants, the overflowed value can still be used with
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR, but not otherwise.

Parse the whole compilation unit before starting to produce code.
This allows some extra optimizations to take place but consumes
more memory (in general).  There are some compatibility issues
with \fIunit-at-a-time\fR mode:
.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
enabling \fIunit-at-a-time\fR mode may change the order
in which functions, variables, and top-level \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statements
are emitted, and will likely break code relying on some particular
ordering.  The majority of such top-level \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statements,
though, can be replaced by \f(CW\*(C`section\*(C'\fR attributes.  The
\&\fBfno-toplevel-reorder\fR option may be used to keep the ordering
used in the input file, at the cost of some optimizations.
.IP "*" 4
\&\fIunit-at-a-time\fR mode removes unreferenced static variables
and functions.  This may result in undefined references
when an \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statement refers directly to variables or functions
that are otherwise unused.  In that case either the variable/function
shall be listed as an operand of the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statement operand or,
in the case of top-level \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statements the attribute \f(CW\*(C`used\*(C'\fR
shall be used on the declaration.
.IP "*" 4
Static functions now can use non-standard passing conventions that
may break \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR statements calling functions directly.  Again,
attribute \f(CW\*(C`used\*(C'\fR will prevent this behavior.

Do not reorder top-level functions, variables, and \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR

input file.  When this option is used, unreferenced static variables
will not be removed.  This option is intended to support existing code
which relies on a particular ordering.  For new code, it is better to
use attributes.
.IP "\fB\-fweb\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fweb"
Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes and assign
each web individual pseudo register.  This allows the register allocation pass
to operate on pseudos directly, but also strengthens several other optimization
passes, such as \s-1CSE\s0, loop optimizer and trivial dead code remover.  It can,
however, make debugging impossible, since variables will no longer stay in a

Assume that the current compilation unit represents whole program being
compiled.  All public functions and variables with the exception of \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR

and in a affect gets more aggressively optimized by interprocedural optimizers.
While this option is equivalent to proper use of \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR keyword for
programs consisting of single file, in combination with option
\&\fB\-\-combine\fR this flag can be used to compile most of smaller scale C
programs since the functions and variables become local for the whole combined

Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit other

This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of \s-1IEEE\s0 floating

Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default floating
point rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for all floating point

truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change
the \s-1FP\s0 rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a
non-default rounding mode.  This option disables constant folding of
floating point expressions at compile-time (which may be affected by

In some places, \s-1GCC\s0 uses various constants to control the amount of
optimization that is done.  For example, \s-1GCC\s0 will not inline functions
that contain more that a certain number of instructions.  You can
control some of these constants on the command-line using the
\&\fB\-\-param\fR option.
.Sp
The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are

In each case, the \fIvalue\fR is an integer.  The allowable choices for
\&\fIname\fR are given in the following table:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBsalias-max-implicit-fields\fR" 4
.IX Item "salias-max-implicit-fields"
The maximum number of fields in a variable without direct
structure accesses for which structure aliasing will consider trying

The maximum number of elements an array can have and its elements
still be tracked individually by structure aliasing. The default is 4
.IP "\fBsra-max-structure-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "sra-max-structure-size"
The maximum structure size, in bytes, at which the scalar replacement
of aggregates (\s-1SRA\s0) optimization will perform block copies.  The
default value, 0, implies that \s-1GCC\s0 will select the most appropriate
size itself.
.IP "\fBsra-field-structure-ratio\fR" 4
.IX Item "sra-field-structure-ratio"
The threshold ratio (as a percentage) between instantiated fields and
the complete structure size.  We say that if the ratio of the number
of bytes in instantiated fields to the number of bytes in the complete
structure exceeds this parameter, then block copies are not used.  The
default is 75.
.IP "\fBmax-crossjump-edges\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-crossjump-edges"
The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for crossjumping.
The algorithm used by \fB\-fcrossjumping\fR is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.
.IP "\fBmin-crossjump-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-crossjump-insns"
The minimum number of instructions which must be matched at the end
of two blocks before crossjumping will be performed on them.  This
value is ignored in the case where all instructions in the block being
crossjumped from are matched.  The default value is 5.
.IP "\fBmax-grow-copy-bb-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-grow-copy-bb-insns"
The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks
instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction.
The default value is 8.
.IP "\fBmax-goto-duplication-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-goto-duplication-insns"
The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of
passes, \s-1GCC\s0 factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.  The default value is 8.
.IP "\fBmax-delay-slot-insn-search\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-delay-slot-insn-search"
The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions is searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
will be minimal so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with probably
small improvement in executable run time.
.IP "\fBmax-delay-slot-live-search\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-delay-slot-live-search"
When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compile time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.
.IP "\fBmax-gcse-memory\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-gcse-memory"
The approximate maximum amount of memory that will be allocated in
order to perform the global common subexpression elimination
optimization.  If more memory than specified is required, the
optimization will not be done.
.IP "\fBmax-gcse-passes\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-gcse-passes"
The maximum number of passes of \s-1GCSE\s0 to run.  The default is 1.
.IP "\fBmax-pending-list-length\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-pending-list-length"
The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling will allow
before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large functions
with few branches or calls can create excessively large lists which
needlessly consume memory and resources.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-single\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-single"
Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc.
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in \s-1GCC\s0's
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
will consider for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (\*(C+).
The default value is 450.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-auto\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-auto"
When you use \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler will be investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied.
The default value is 90.
.IP "\fBlarge-function-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-function-insns"
The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining inlining is constrained by
\&\fB\-\-param large-function-growth\fR.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
backend.
This parameter is ignored when \fB\-funit\-at\-a\-time\fR is not used.
The default value is 2700.
.IP "\fBlarge-function-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-function-growth"
Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents.
This parameter is ignored when \fB\-funit\-at\-a\-time\fR is not used.
The default value is 100 which limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.
.IP "\fBlarge-unit-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-unit-insns"
The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by \fB\-\-param inline-unit-growth\fR.
For small units this might be too tight (consider unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three time.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\e% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlininable functions however the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to \fB\-\-param large-unit-insns\fR
before applying \fB\-\-param inline-unit-growth\fR.  The default is 10000
.IP "\fBinline-unit-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "inline-unit-growth"
Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining.
This parameter is ignored when \fB\-funit\-at\-a\-time\fR is not used.
The default value is 50 which limits unit growth to 1.5 times the original
size.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-recursive\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-recursive"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-recursive-auto\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-recursive-auto"
.PD
Specifies maximum number of instructions out-of-line copy of self recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.
.Sp
For functions declared inline \fB\-\-param max-inline-insns-recursive\fR is
taken into account.  For function not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR) is
enabled and \fB\-\-param max-inline-insns-recursive-auto\fR is used.  The
default value is 450.

.IX Item "max-inline-recursive-depth"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBmax-inline-recursive-depth-auto\fR" 4

.Sp
For functions declared inline \fB\-\-param max-inline-recursive-depth\fR is
taken into account.  For function not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR) is
enabled and \fB\-\-param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto\fR is used.  The
default value is 450.
.IP "\fBmin-inline-recursive-probability\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-inline-recursive-probability"
Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion
in average and can hurt for function having little recursion depth by
increasing the prologue size or complexity of function body to other
optimizers.
.Sp
When profile feedback is available (see \fB\-fprofile\-generate\fR) the actual
recursion depth can be guessed from probability that function will recurse via
given call expression.  This parameter limits inlining only to call expression
whose probability exceeds given threshold (in percents).  The default value is
10.
.IP "\fBinline-call-cost\fR" 4
.IX Item "inline-call-cost"
Specify cost of call instruction relative to simple arithmetics operations
(having cost of 1).  Increasing this cost disqualifies inlining of non-leaf
functions and at the same time increases size of leaf function that is believed to
reduce function size by being inlined.  In effect it increases amount of
inlining for code having large abstraction penalty (many functions that just
pass the arguments to other functions) and decrease inlining for code with low
abstraction penalty.  The default value is 16.
.IP "\fBmax-unrolled-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-unrolled-insns"
The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled, it determines how many times
the loop code is unrolled.
.IP "\fBmax-average-unrolled-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-average-unrolled-insns"
The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of their execution
that a loop should have if that loop is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled,
it determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.
.IP "\fBmax-unroll-times\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-unroll-times"
The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.
.IP "\fBmax-peeled-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-peeled-insns"
The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is peeled, and if the loop is peeled, it determines how many times
the loop code is peeled.
.IP "\fBmax-peel-times\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-peel-times"
The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.
.IP "\fBmax-completely-peeled-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-completely-peeled-insns"
The maximum number of insns of a completely peeled loop.
.IP "\fBmax-completely-peel-times\fR" 4

The maximum number of iterations of a loop to be suitable for complete peeling.
.IP "\fBmax-unswitch-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-unswitch-insns"
The maximum number of insns of an unswitched loop.
.IP "\fBmax-unswitch-level\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-unswitch-level"

The minimum cost of an expensive expression in the loop invariant motion.
.IP "\fBiv-consider-all-candidates-bound\fR" 4
.IX Item "iv-consider-all-candidates-bound"
Bound on number of candidates for induction variables below that
all candidates are considered for each use in induction variable
optimizations.  Only the most relevant candidates are considered
if there are more candidates, to avoid quadratic time complexity.
.IP "\fBiv-max-considered-uses\fR" 4
.IX Item "iv-max-considered-uses"
The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that contain more
induction variable uses.
.IP "\fBiv-always-prune-cand-set-bound\fR" 4
.IX Item "iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound"
If number of candidates in the set is smaller than this value,
we always try to remove unnecessary ivs from the set during its
optimization when a new iv is added to the set.
.IP "\fBscev-max-expr-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "scev-max-expr-size"
Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions analyzer.
Large expressions slow the analyzer.
.IP "\fBvect-max-version-checks\fR" 4
.IX Item "vect-max-version-checks"
The maximum number of runtime checks that can be performed when doing
loop versioning in the vectorizer.  See option ftree-vect-loop-version
for more information.
.IP "\fBmax-iterations-to-track\fR" 4

The maximum number of iterations of a loop the brute force algorithm
for analysis of # of iterations of the loop tries to evaluate.
.IP "\fBhot-bb-count-fraction\fR" 4

Select fraction of the maximal count of repetitions of basic block in program
given basic block needs to have to be considered hot.
.IP "\fBhot-bb-frequency-fraction\fR" 4

Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of basic block in
function given basic block needs to have to be considered hot
.IP "\fBmax-predicted-iterations\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-predicted-iterations"
The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful
in cases where function contain single loop with known bound and other loop
with unknown.  We predict the known number of iterations correctly, while
the unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that the
loop without bounds would appear artificially cold relative to the other one.

.IX Item "tracer-dynamic-coverage"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBtracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback\fR" 4
.IX Item "tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback"
.PD
This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given percentage of
executed instructions is covered.  This limits unnecessary code size
expansion.
.Sp
The \fBtracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback\fR is used only when profile
feedback is available.  The real profiles (as opposed to statically estimated
ones) are much less balanced allowing the threshold to be larger value.
.IP "\fBtracer-max-code-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "tracer-max-code-growth"
Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is
rather hokey argument, as most of the duplicates will be eliminated later in
cross jumping, so it may be set to much higher values than is the desired code
growth.
.IP "\fBtracer-min-branch-ratio\fR" 4
.IX Item "tracer-min-branch-ratio"
Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge is less than this
threshold (in percent).

Stop forward growth if the best edge do have probability lower than this
threshold.
.Sp
Similarly to \fBtracer-dynamic-coverage\fR two values are present, one for
compilation for profile feedback and one for compilation without.  The value
for compilation with profile feedback needs to be more conservative (higher) in
order to make tracer effective.
.IP "\fBmax-cse-path-length\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-cse-path-length"
Maximum number of basic blocks on path that cse considers.  The default is 10.
.IP "\fBmax-cse-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-cse-insns"
The maximum instructions \s-1CSE\s0 process before flushing. The default is 1000.
.IP "\fBglobal-var-threshold\fR" 4
.IX Item "global-var-threshold"
Counts the number of function calls (\fIn\fR) and the number of
call-clobbered variables (\fIv\fR).  If \fIn\fRx\fIv\fR is larger than this limit, a
single artificial variable will be created to represent all the
call-clobbered variables at function call sites.  This artificial
variable will then be made to alias every call-clobbered variable.
(done as \f(CW\*(C`int * size_t\*(C'\fR on the host machine; beware overflow).
.IP "\fBmax-aliased-vops\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-aliased-vops"
Maximum number of virtual operands allowed to represent aliases
before triggering the alias grouping heuristic.  Alias grouping
reduces compile times and memory consumption needed for aliasing at
the expense of precision loss in alias information.
.IP "\fBggc-min-expand\fR" 4
.IX Item "ggc-min-expand"
\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections.
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.
.Sp
The default is 30% + 70% * (\s-1RAM/1GB\s0) with an upper bound of 100% when
\&\s-1RAM\s0 >= 1GB.  If \f(CW\*(C`getrlimit\*(C'\fR is available, the notion of \*(L"\s-1RAM\s0\*(R" is
the smallest of actual \s-1RAM\s0 and \f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_DATA\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_AS\*(C'\fR.  If
\&\s-1GCC\s0 is not able to calculate \s-1RAM\s0 on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
\&\fBggc-min-heapsize\fR to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.
.IP "\fBggc-min-heapsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "ggc-min-heapsize"
Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by \fBggc-min-expand\fR% beyond \fBggc-min-heapsize\fR.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.
.Sp
The default is the smaller of \s-1RAM/8\s0, \s-1RLIMIT_RSS\s0, or a limit which
tries to ensure that \s-1RLIMIT_DATA\s0 or \s-1RLIMIT_AS\s0 are not exceeded, but
with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If \s-1GCC\s0 is not able to calculate \s-1RAM\s0 on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this
parameter and \fBggc-min-expand\fR to zero causes a full collection
to occur at every opportunity.
.IP "\fBmax-reload-search-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-reload-search-insns"
The maximum number of instruction reload should look backward for equivalent

.IP "\fBmax-cselib-memory-locations\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-cselib-memory-locations"
The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take into account.
Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making the compile time

.Sp
The \fBreorder-block-duplicate-feedback\fR is used only when profile

.IX Item "max-sched-ready-insns"
The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the scheduler should

Write output to \fIfile\fR.  This is the same as specifying \fIfile\fR
as the second non-option argument to \fBcpp\fR.  \fBgcc\fR has a
different interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must
use \fB\-o\fR to specify the output file.
.IP "\fB\-Wall\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wall"
Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
At present this is \fB\-Wcomment\fR, \fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR,
\&\fB\-Wmultichar\fR and a warning about integer promotion causing a
change of sign in \f(CW\*(C`#if\*(C'\fR expressions.  Note that many of the
preprocessor's warnings are on by default and have no options to
control them.
.IP "\fB\-Wcomment\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcomment"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-Wcomments\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcomments"
.PD
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence \fB/*\fR appears in a \fB/*\fR
comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a \fB//\fR comment.
(Both forms have the same effect.)
.IP "\fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtrigraphs"
Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the program.
However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline (\fB??/\fR at
the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment begins or ends.
Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped newlines produce
warnings inside a comment.
.Sp
This option is implied by \fB\-Wall\fR.  If \fB\-Wall\fR is not
given, this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To
get trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other
\&\fB\-Wall\fR warnings, use \fB\-trigraphs \-Wall \-Wno\-trigraphs\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wtraditional\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtraditional"
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
\&\s-1ISO\s0 C.  Also warn about \s-1ISO\s0 C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and problematic constructs which should be avoided.
.IP "\fB\-Wimport\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wimport"
Warn the first time \fB#import\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-Wundef\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wundef"
Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in an
\&\fB#if\fR directive, outside of \fBdefined\fR.  Such identifiers are
replaced with zero.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-macros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-macros"
Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro
is \fIused\fR if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once.
The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used at the
time it is redefined or undefined.
.Sp
Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.
.Sp
\&\fINote:\fR If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then \s-1CPP\s0 will report it as unused.  To avoid the
warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's
definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
\&        #endif
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wendif\-labels\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wendif-labels"
Warn whenever an \fB#else\fR or an \fB#endif\fR are followed by text.
This usually happens in code of the form
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        #if FOO
\&        ...
\&        #else FOO
\&        ...
\&        #endif FOO
.Ve
.Sp
The second and third \f(CW\*(C`FOO\*(C'\fR should be in comments, but often are not
in older programs.  This warning is on by default.
.IP "\fB\-Werror\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror"
Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings
will be rejected.
.IP "\fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsystem-headers"
Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful
in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are
responsible for the system library, you may want to see them.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w"
Suppress all warnings, including those which \s-1GNU\s0 \s-1CPP\s0 issues by default.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic"
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of
them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless
code.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic-errors"
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics
into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that \s-1GCC\s0 issues
without \fB\-pedantic\fR but treats as warnings.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M"
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for \fBmake\fR describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one \fBmake\fR rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from \fB\-include\fR or
\&\fB\-imacros\fR command line options.
.Sp
Unless specified explicitly (with \fB\-MT\fR or \fB\-MQ\fR), the
object file name consists of the basename of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix.  If there are many included
files then the rule is split into several lines using \fB\e\fR\-newline.
The rule has no commands.
.Sp
This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
\&\fB\-dM\fR.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
\&\fB\-MF\fR, or use an environment variable like
\&\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR.  Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.
.Sp
Passing \fB\-M\fR to the driver implies \fB\-E\fR, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit \fB\-w\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MM"
Like \fB\-M\fR but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.
.Sp
This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
\&\fB#include\fR directive does not in itself determine whether that
header will appear in \fB\-MM\fR dependency output.  This is a
slight change in semantics from \s-1GCC\s0 versions 3.0 and earlier.
.IP "\fB\-MF\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MF file"
When used with \fB\-M\fR or \fB\-MM\fR, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no \fB\-MF\fR switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent
preprocessed output.
.Sp
When used with the driver options \fB\-MD\fR or \fB\-MMD\fR,
\&\fB\-MF\fR overrides the default dependency output file.
.IP "\fB\-MG\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MG"
In conjunction with an option such as \fB\-M\fR requesting
dependency generation, \fB\-MG\fR assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include\*(C'\fR directive without prepending any path.  \fB\-MG\fR
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.
.Sp
This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
.IP "\fB\-MP\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MP"
This option instructs \s-1CPP\s0 to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors \fBmake\fR gives if you remove header
files without updating the \fIMakefile\fR to match.
.Sp
This is typical output:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        test.o: test.c test.h
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        test.h:
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-MT\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MT target"
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default \s-1CPP\s0 takes the name of the main input file, including any path,
deletes any file suffix such as \fB.c\fR, and appends the platform's
usual object suffix.  The result is the target.
.Sp
An \fB\-MT\fR option will set the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to \fB\-MT\fR, or use multiple \fB\-MT\fR options.
.Sp
For example, \fB\-MT\ '$(objpfx)foo.o'\fR might give
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-MQ\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MQ target"
Same as \fB\-MT\fR, but it quotes any characters which are special to
Make.  \fB\-MQ\ '$(objpfx)foo.o'\fR gives
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
.Ve
.Sp
The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
\&\fB\-MQ\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MD"
\&\fB\-MD\fR is equivalent to \fB\-M \-MF\fR \fIfile\fR, except that
\&\fB\-E\fR is not implied.  The driver determines \fIfile\fR based on
whether an \fB\-o\fR option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of \fI.d\fR, otherwise it take the
basename of the input file and applies a \fI.d\fR suffix.
.Sp
If \fB\-MD\fR is used in conjunction with \fB\-E\fR, any
\&\fB\-o\fR switch is understood to specify the dependency output file, but if used without \fB\-E\fR, each \fB\-o\fR
is understood to specify a target object file.
.Sp
Since \fB\-E\fR is not implied, \fB\-MD\fR can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.
.IP "\fB\-MMD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MMD"
Like \fB\-MD\fR except mention only user header files, not system
header files.
.IP "\fB\-fpch\-deps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpch-deps"
When using precompiled headers, this flag
will cause the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified only the
precompiled header would be listed and not the files that were used to
create it because those files are not consulted when a precompiled
header is used.
.IP "\fB\-fpch\-preprocess\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpch-preprocess"
This option allows use of a precompiled header together with \fB\-E\fR.  It inserts a special \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "<filename>"\*(C'\fR in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its filename.  When
\&\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR is in use, \s-1GCC\s0 recognizes this \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR and
loads the \s-1PCH\s0.
.Sp
This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output
is only really suitable as input to \s-1GCC\s0.  It is switched on by
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.Sp
You should not write this \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR in your own code, but it is
safe to edit the filename if the \s-1PCH\s0 file is available in a different
location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be relative to \s-1GCC\s0's
current directory.

.PD
Specify the source language: C, \*(C+, Objective\-C, or assembly.  This has
nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it merely
selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:
\&\fB.c\fR, \fB.cc\fR, \fB.m\fR, or \fB.S\fR.  Some other common
extensions for \*(C+ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not
recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.
.Sp
\&\fINote:\fR Previous versions of cpp accepted a \fB\-lang\fR option

Split the include path.  Any directories specified with \fB\-I\fR

.IP "\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpreprocessed"
Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with \fB\-C\fR to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR is implicit if the input file has one of the

Set the execution character set, used for string and character

.IP "\fB\-fwide\-exec\-charset=\fR\fIcharset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fwide-exec-charset=charset"
Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and
character constants.  The default is \s-1UTF\-32\s0 or \s-1UTF\-16\s0, whichever
corresponds to the width of \f(CW\*(C`wchar_t\*(C'\fR.  As with
\&\fB\-fexec\-charset\fR, \fIcharset\fR can be any encoding supported
by the system's \f(CW\*(C`iconv\*(C'\fR library routine; however, you will have
problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in \f(CW\*(C`wchar_t\*(C'\fR.

.IX Item "-finput-charset=charset"
Set the input character set, used for translation from the character
set of the input file to the source character set used by \s-1GCC\s0.  If the
locale does not specify, or \s-1GCC\s0 cannot get this information from the
locale, the default is \s-1UTF\-8\s0.  This can be overridden by either the locale
or this command line option.  Currently the command line option takes
precedence if there's a conflict.  \fIcharset\fR can be any encoding
supported by the system's \f(CW\*(C`iconv\*(C'\fR library routine.
.IP "\fB\-fworking\-directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fworking-directory"
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor will
emit, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the
current working directory followed by two slashes.  \s-1GCC\s0 will use this
directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form \fB\-fno\-working\-directory\fR.  If the \fB\-P\fR flag is

file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.
.Sp
You should be prepared for side effects when using \fB\-C\fR; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary
source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a \fB#\fR.
.IP "\fB\-CC\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CC"
Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is
like \fB\-C\fR, except that comments contained within macros are
also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.
.Sp
In addition to the side-effects of the \fB\-C\fR option, the
\&\fB\-CC\fR option causes all \*(C+\-style comments inside a macro
to be converted to C\-style comments.  This is to prevent later use
of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of
the source line.
.Sp
The \fB\-CC\fR option is generally used to support lint comments.
.IP "\fB\-traditional\-cpp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-traditional-cpp"
Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C preprocessors, as
opposed to \s-1ISO\s0 C preprocessors.
.IP "\fB\-trigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-trigraphs"
Process trigraph sequences.
These are three-character sequences, all starting with \fB??\fR, that
are defined by \s-1ISO\s0 C to stand for single characters.  For example,
\&\fB??/\fR stands for \fB\e\fR, so \fB'??/n'\fR is a character
constant for a newline.  By default, \s-1GCC\s0 ignores trigraphs, but in
standard-conforming modes it converts them.  See the \fB\-std\fR and
\&\fB\-ansi\fR options.
.Sp
The nine trigraphs and their replacements are
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        Trigraph:       ??(  ??)  ??<  ??>  ??=  ??/  ??'  ??!  ??-

If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
\&\fB\-Xassembler\fR twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
.Sh "Options for Linking"
.IX Subsection "Options for Linking"
These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.
.IP "\fIobject-file-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "object-file-name"
A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E"
.PD
If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
object file names should not be used as arguments.  
.IP "\fB\-l\fR\fIlibrary\fR" 4
.IX Item "-llibrary"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-l\fR \fIlibrary\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l library"
.PD
Search the library named \fIlibrary\fR when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
\&\s-1POSIX\s0 compliance and is not recommended.)
.Sp
It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, \fBfoo.o \-lz bar.o\fR searches library \fBz\fR
after file \fIfoo.o\fR but before \fIbar.o\fR.  If \fIbar.o\fR refers
to functions in \fBz\fR, those functions may not be loaded.
.Sp
The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named \fIlib\fIlibrary\fI.a\fR.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.
.Sp
The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with \fB\-L\fR.
.Sp
Normally the files found this way are library files\-\-\-archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an \fB\-l\fR option and specifying a file name
is that \fB\-l\fR surrounds \fIlibrary\fR with \fBlib\fR and \fB.a\fR
and searches several directories.
.IP "\fB\-lobjc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-lobjc"
You need this special case of the \fB\-l\fR option in order to
link an Objective-C or Objective\-\*(C+ program.
.IP "\fB\-nostartfiles\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostartfiles"
Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless \fB\-nostdlib\fR
or \fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nodefaultlibs"
Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.
Only the libraries you specify will be passed to the linker.
The standard startup files are used normally, unless \fB\-nostartfiles\fR
is used.  The compiler may generate calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcmp\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`memmove\*(C'\fR.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
.IP "\fB\-nostdlib\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdlib"
Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.
No startup files and only the libraries you specify will be passed to
the linker.  The compiler may generate calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcmp\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`memmove\*(C'\fR.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
.Sp
One of the standard libraries bypassed by \fB\-nostdlib\fR and
\&\fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR is \fIlibgcc.a\fR, a library of internal subroutines
that \s-1GCC\s0 uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages.
.Sp
In most cases, you need \fIlibgcc.a\fR even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify \fB\-nostdlib\fR
or \fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR you should usually specify \fB\-lgcc\fR as well.
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal \s-1GCC\s0
library subroutines.  (For example, \fB_\|_main\fR, used to ensure \*(C+
constructors will be called.)
.IP "\fB\-pie\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pie"
Produce a position independent executable on targets which support it.
For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
that were used to generate code (\fB\-fpie\fR, \fB\-fPIE\fR,
or model suboptions) when you specify this option.
.IP "\fB\-rdynamic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rdynamic"
Pass the flag \fB\-export\-dynamic\fR to the \s-1ELF\s0 linker, on targets
that support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not
only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed
for some uses of \f(CW\*(C`dlopen\*(C'\fR or to allow obtaining backtraces
from within a program.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.
.IP "\fB\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static"
On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared
libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-shared\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shared"
Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For predictable
results, you must also specify the same set of options that were used to
generate code (\fB\-fpic\fR, \fB\-fPIC\fR, or model suboptions)
when you specify this option.[1]
.IP "\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shared-libgcc"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-static\-libgcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libgcc"
.PD
On systems that provide \fIlibgcc\fR as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version respectively.
If no shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.
.Sp
There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared \fIlibgcc\fR instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared \fIlibgcc\fR.
.Sp
Therefore, the G++ and \s-1GCJ\s0 drivers automatically add
\&\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR whenever you build a shared library or a main
executable, because \*(C+ and Java programs typically use exceptions, so
this is the right thing to do.
.Sp
If, instead, you use the \s-1GCC\s0 driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they will not always be linked with the shared \fIlibgcc\fR.
If \s-1GCC\s0 finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a \s-1GNU\s0 linker that does not support option \fB\-\-eh\-frame\-hdr\fR,
it will link the shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it will take advantage of the linker and optimize
away the linking with the shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.
.Sp
However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or \s-1GCJ\s0 driver, as appropriate
for the languages used in the program, or using the option
\&\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR, such that it is linked with the shared
\&\fIlibgcc\fR.
.IP "\fB\-symbolic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-symbolic"
Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option \fB\-Xlinker \-z \-Xlinker defs\fR).  Only a few systems support
this option.
.IP "\fB\-Xlinker\fR \fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Xlinker option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options which \s-1GCC\s0 does not know how to
recognize.
.Sp
If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
\&\fB\-Xlinker\fR twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass \fB\-assert definitions\fR, you must write
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-assert \-Xlinker definitions\fR.  It does not work to write
\&\fB\-Xlinker \*(L"\-assert definitions\*(R"\fR, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.
.IP "\fB\-Wl,\fR\fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wl,option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the linker.  If \fIoption\fR contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR \fIsymbol\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u symbol"
Pretend the symbol \fIsymbol\fR is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it.  You can use \fB\-u\fR multiple times with
different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.
.Sh "Options for Directory Search"
.IX Subsection "Options for Directory Search"
These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:
.IP "\fB\-I\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Idir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the system header file directories.  However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use \fB\-isystem\fR for that).  If you use more than
one \fB\-I\fR option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right
order; the standard system directories come after.
.Sp
If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
\&\fB\-isystem\fR, is also specified with \fB\-I\fR, the \fB\-I\fR
option will be ignored.  The directory will still be searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that \s-1GCC\s0's procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the include_next directive are not inadvertently changed.
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the \fB\-nostdinc\fR and/or \fB\-isystem\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-iquote\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iquotedir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of directories to
be searched for header files only for the case of \fB#include
"\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR; they are not searched for \fB#include <\fR\fIfile\fR\fB>\fR,
otherwise just like \fB\-I\fR.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Ldir"
Add directory \fIdir\fR to the list of directories to be searched
for \fB\-l\fR.
.IP "\fB\-B\fR\fIprefix\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Bprefix"
This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.
.Sp
The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
\&\fIcpp\fR, \fIcc1\fR, \fIas\fR and \fIld\fR.  It tries
\&\fIprefix\fR as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without \fImachine\fR\fB/\fR\fIversion\fR\fB/\fR.
.Sp
For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
\&\fB\-B\fR prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if \fB\-B\fR
was not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, which are
\&\fI/usr/lib/gcc/\fR and \fI/usr/local/lib/gcc/\fR.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
\&\fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR environment variable.
.Sp
The compiler will check to see if the path provided by the \fB\-B\fR
refers to a directory, and if necessary it will add a directory
separator character at the end of the path.
.Sp
\&\fB\-B\fR prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into \fB\-L\fR options for the linker.  They also apply to
includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into \fB\-isystem\fR options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends \fBinclude\fR to the prefix.
.Sp
The run-time support file \fIlibgcc.a\fR can also be searched for using
the \fB\-B\fR prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.
.Sp
Another way to specify a prefix much like the \fB\-B\fR prefix is to use
the environment variable \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.  
.Sp
As a special kludge, if the path provided by \fB\-B\fR is
\&\fI[dir/]stage\fIN\fI/\fR, where \fIN\fR is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it will be replaced by \fI[dir/]include\fR.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.
.IP "\fB\-specs=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-specs=file"
Process \fIfile\fR after the compiler reads in the standard \fIspecs\fR
file, in order to override the defaults that the \fIgcc\fR driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to \fIcc1\fR,
\&\fIcc1plus\fR, \fIas\fR, \fIld\fR, etc.  More than one
\&\fB\-specs=\fR\fIfile\fR can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.
.IP "\fB\-\-sysroot=\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "--sysroot=dir"
Use \fIdir\fR as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
For example, if the compiler would normally search for headers in
\&\fI/usr/include\fR and libraries in \fI/usr/lib\fR, it will instead
search \fI\fIdir\fI/usr/include\fR and \fI\fIdir\fI/usr/lib\fR.  
.Sp
If you use both this option and the \fB\-isysroot\fR option, then
the \fB\-\-sysroot\fR option will apply to libraries, but the
\&\fB\-isysroot\fR option will apply to header files.
.Sp
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support
for this option.  If your linker does not support this option, the
header file aspect of \fB\-\-sysroot\fR will still work, but the
library aspect will not.
.IP "\fB\-I\-\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I-"
This option has been deprecated.  Please use \fB\-iquote\fR instead for
\&\fB\-I\fR directories before the \fB\-I\-\fR and remove the \fB\-I\-\fR.
Any directories you specify with \fB\-I\fR options before the \fB\-I\-\fR
option are searched only for the case of \fB#include "\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR;
they are not searched for \fB#include <\fR\fIfile\fR\fB>\fR.
.Sp
If additional directories are specified with \fB\-I\fR options after
the \fB\-I\-\fR, these directories are searched for all \fB#include\fR
directives.  (Ordinarily \fIall\fR \fB\-I\fR directories are used
this way.)
.Sp
In addition, the \fB\-I\-\fR option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for \fB#include "\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR.  There is no way to
override this effect of \fB\-I\-\fR.  With \fB\-I.\fR you can specify
searching the directory which was current when the compiler was
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.
.Sp
\&\fB\-I\-\fR does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, \fB\-I\-\fR and \fB\-nostdinc\fR are
independent.
.Sh "Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version"
.IX Subsection "Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version"
The usual way to run \s-1GCC\s0 is to run the executable called \fIgcc\fR, or
\&\fI<machine>\-gcc\fR when cross\-compiling, or
\&\fI<machine>\-gcc\-<version>\fR to run a version other than the one that
was installed last.  Sometimes this is inconvenient, so \s-1GCC\s0 provides
options that will switch to another cross-compiler or version.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fImachine\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b machine"
The argument \fImachine\fR specifies the target machine for compilation.
.Sp
The value to use for \fImachine\fR is the same as was specified as the
machine type when configuring \s-1GCC\s0 as a cross\-compiler.  For
example, if a cross-compiler was configured with \fBconfigure
arm-elf\fR, meaning to compile for an arm processor with elf binaries,
then you would specify \fB\-b arm-elf\fR to run that cross compiler.
Because there are other options beginning with \fB\-b\fR, the
configuration must contain a hyphen. 
.IP "\fB\-V\fR \fIversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V version"
The argument \fIversion\fR specifies which version of \s-1GCC\s0 to run.
This is useful when multiple versions are installed.  For example,
\&\fIversion\fR might be \fB4.0\fR, meaning to run \s-1GCC\s0 version 4.0.
.PP
The \fB\-V\fR and \fB\-b\fR options work by running the
\&\fI<machine>\-gcc\-<version>\fR executable, so there's no real reason to
use them if you can just run that directly.
.Sh "Hardware Models and Configurations"
.IX Subsection "Hardware Models and Configurations"
Earlier we discussed the standard option \fB\-b\fR which chooses among
different installed compilers for completely different target

In addition, each of these target machine types can have its own
special options, starting with \fB\-m\fR, to choose among various
hardware models or configurations\-\-\-for example, 68010 vs 68020,
floating coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the

Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the \s-1ARM\s0 Procedure Call
Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly necessary for
correct execution of the code.  Specifying \fB\-fomit\-frame\-pointer\fR
with this option will cause the stack frames not to be generated for
leaf functions.  The default is \fB\-mno\-apcs\-frame\fR.

.IP "\fB\-mthumb\-interwork\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mthumb-interwork"
Generate code which supports calling between the \s-1ARM\s0 and Thumb
instruction sets.  Without this option the two instruction sets cannot
be reliably used inside one program.  The default is

when \fB\-mthumb\-interwork\fR is specified.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-sched\-prolog\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-sched-prolog"
Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prolog, or the
merging of those instruction with the instructions in the function's
body.  This means that all functions will start with a recognizable set
of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of
different function prologues), and this information can be used to
locate the start if functions inside an executable piece of code.  The
default is \fB\-msched\-prolog\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mhard\-float\fR" 4

Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is the

.IP "\fB\-mtune=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtune=name"
This option is very similar to the \fB\-mcpu=\fR option, except that
instead of specifying the actual target processor type, and hence
restricting which instructions can be used, it specifies that \s-1GCC\s0 should
tune the performance of the code as if the target were of the type
specified in this option, but still choosing the instructions that it
will generate based on the cpu specified by a \fB\-mcpu=\fR option.
For some \s-1ARM\s0 implementations better performance can be obtained by using
this option.
.IP "\fB\-march=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-march=name"
This specifies the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 architecture.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses this
name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction with or instead
of the \fB\-mcpu=\fR option.  Permissible names are: \fBarmv2\fR,
\&\fBarmv2a\fR, \fBarmv3\fR, \fBarmv3m\fR, \fBarmv4\fR, \fBarmv4t\fR,
\&\fBarmv5\fR, \fBarmv5t\fR, \fBarmv5te\fR, \fBarmv6\fR, \fBarmv6j\fR,

This specifies what floating point hardware (or hardware emulation) is
available on the target.  Permissible names are: \fBfpa\fR, \fBfpe2\fR,
\&\fBfpe3\fR, \fBmaverick\fR, \fBvfp\fR.  \fB\-mfp\fR and \fB\-mfpe\fR
are synonyms for \fB\-mfpu\fR=\fBfpe\fR\fInumber\fR, for compatibility
with older versions of \s-1GCC\s0.
.Sp
If \fB\-msoft\-float\fR is specified this specifies the format of
floating point values.
.IP "\fB\-mstructure\-size\-boundary=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstructure-size-boundary=n"
The size of all structures and unions will be rounded up to a multiple
of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible values are 8, 32
and 64.  The default value varies for different toolchains.  For the \s-1COFF\s0
targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  A value of 64 is only allowed
if the underlying \s-1ABI\s0 supports it.
.Sp
Specifying the larger number can produce faster, more efficient code, but
can also increase the size of the program.  Different values are potentially
incompatible.  Code compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to
work with code or libraries compiled with another value, if they exchange
information using structures or unions.
.IP "\fB\-mabort\-on\-noreturn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mabort-on-noreturn"
Generate a call to the function \f(CW\*(C`abort\*(C'\fR at the end of a

return.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-long\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-long-calls"
.PD
Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
will lie outside of the 64 megabyte addressing range of the offset based
version of subroutine call instruction.
.Sp
Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls will be turned
into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions, functions
which have the \fBshort-call\fR attribute, functions that are inside
the scope of a \fB#pragma no_long_calls\fR directive and functions whose
definitions have already been compiled within the current compilation
unit, will not be turned into long calls.  The exception to this rule is
that weak function definitions, functions with the \fBlong-call\fR
attribute or the \fBsection\fR attribute, and functions that are within
the scope of a \fB#pragma long_calls\fR directive, will always be
turned into long calls.
.Sp
This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
\&\fB\-mno\-long\-calls\fR will restore the default behavior, as will
placing the function calls within the scope of a \fB#pragma
long_calls_off\fR directive.  Note these switches have no effect on how
the compiler generates code to handle function calls via function
pointers.
.IP "\fB\-mnop\-fun\-dllimport\fR" 4

Disable support for the \f(CW\*(C`dllimport\*(C'\fR attribute.
.IP "\fB\-msingle\-pic\-base\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msingle-pic-base"
Treat the register used for \s-1PIC\s0 addressing as read\-only, rather than
loading it in the prologue for each function.  The run-time system is
responsible for initializing this register with an appropriate value
before execution begins.
.IP "\fB\-mpic\-register=\fR\fIreg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpic-register=reg"
Specify the register to be used for \s-1PIC\s0 addressing.  The default is R10
unless stack-checking is enabled, when R9 is used.
.IP "\fB\-mcirrus\-fix\-invalid\-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcirrus-fix-invalid-insns"
Insert NOPs into the instruction stream to in order to work around
problems with invalid Maverick instruction combinations.  This option
is only valid if the \fB\-mcpu=ep9312\fR option has been used to
enable generation of instructions for the Cirrus Maverick floating
point co\-processor.  This option is not enabled by default, since the
problem is only present in older Maverick implementations.  The default
can be re-enabled by use of the \fB\-mno\-cirrus\-fix\-invalid\-insns\fR
switch.
.IP "\fB\-mpoke\-function\-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpoke-function-name"
Write the name of each function into the text section, directly
preceding the function prologue.  The generated code is similar to this:
.Sp

.Ve
.Sp
When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of
\&\f(CW\*(C`pc\*(C'\fR stored at \f(CW\*(C`fp + 0\*(C'\fR.  If the trace function then looks at
location \f(CW\*(C`pc \- 12\*(C'\fR and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this location
and has length \f(CW\*(C`((pc[\-3]) & 0xff000000)\*(C'\fR.

.IP "\fB\-mcallee\-super\-interworking\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcallee-super-interworking"
Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled an \s-1ARM\s0
instruction set header which switches to Thumb mode before executing the

non-interworking code.
.IP "\fB\-mcaller\-super\-interworking\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcaller-super-interworking"
Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to

linker multiple times and joining the results together with
\&\fIlipo\fR.
.PP
The subtype of the file created (like \fBppc7400\fR or \fBppc970\fR or
\&\fBi686\fR) is determined by the flags that specify the \s-1ISA\s0
that \s-1GCC\s0 is targetting, like \fB\-mcpu\fR or \fB\-march\fR.  The
\&\fB\-force_cpusubtype_ALL\fR option can be used to override this.
.PP
The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an \s-1ISA\s0
mismatch.  The assembler, \fIas\fR, will only permit instructions to
be used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating,
so you cannot put 64\-bit instructions in an \fBppc750\fR object file.
The linker for shared libraries, \fI/usr/bin/libtool\fR, will fail
and print an error if asked to create a shared library with a less
restrictive subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put
a \fBppc970\fR object file in a \fBppc7400\fR library).  The linker
for executables, \fIld\fR, will quietly give the executable the most
restrictive subtype of any of its input files.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Fdir"
Add the framework directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files.  These directories are
interleaved with those specified by \fB\-I\fR options and are
scanned in a left-to-right order.
.Sp
A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.  A
framework is a directory with a \fB\*(L"Headers\*(R"\fR and/or
\&\fB\*(L"PrivateHeaders\*(R"\fR directory contained directly in it that ends
in \fB\*(L".framework\*(R"\fR.  The name of a framework is the name of this
directory excluding the \fB\*(L".framework\*(R"\fR.  Headers associated with
the framework are found in one of those two directories, with
\&\fB\*(L"Headers\*(R"\fR being searched first.  A subframework is a framework
directory that is in a framework's \fB\*(L"Frameworks\*(R"\fR directory.
Includes of subframework headers can only appear in a header of a
framework that contains the subframework, or in a sibling subframework
header.  Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the same
framework.  A subframework should not have the same name as a
framework, a warning will be issued if this is violated.  Currently a
subframework cannot have subframeworks, in the future, the mechanism
may be extended to support this.  The standard frameworks can be found
in \fB\*(L"/System/Library/Frameworks\*(R"\fR and
\&\fB\*(L"/Library/Frameworks\*(R"\fR.  An example include looks like
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include <Framework/header.h>\*(C'\fR, where \fBFramework\fR denotes
the name of the framework and header.h is found in the
\&\fB\*(L"PrivateHeaders\*(R"\fR or \fB\*(L"Headers\*(R"\fR directory.

.IX Item "-mno-soft-float"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-msoft\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-float"
.PD
Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
floating-point operations.  When \fB\-msoft\-float\fR is specified,
functions in \fIlibgcc.a\fR will be used to perform floating-point
operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
emulations routines, these routines will issue floating-point
operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point
operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
them.
.Sp
Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are
required to have floating-point registers.

.IX Item "-mfp-reg"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-fp-regs"
.PD
Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set.
\&\fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR implies \fB\-msoft\-float\fR.  If the floating-point
register set is not used, floating point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
in \f(CW$0\fR instead of \f(CW$f0\fR.  This is a non-standard calling sequence,
so any function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with \fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR must also be compiled with that
option.
.Sp
A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.
.IP "\fB\-mieee\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mieee"
The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized for
maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with the \s-1IEEE\s0 floating
point standard.  However, for full compliance, software assistance is
required.  This option generates code fully \s-1IEEE\s0 compliant code
\&\fIexcept\fR that the \fIinexact-flag\fR is not maintained (see below).
If this option is turned on, the preprocessor macro \f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP\*(C'\fR is
defined during compilation.  The resulting code is less efficient but is
able to correctly support denormalized numbers and exceptional \s-1IEEE\s0
values such as not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha
compilers call this option \fB\-ieee_with_no_inexact\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mieee\-with\-inexact\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mieee-with-inexact"
This is like \fB\-mieee\fR except the generated code also maintains
the \s-1IEEE\s0 \fIinexact-flag\fR.  Turning on this option causes the
generated code to implement fully-compliant \s-1IEEE\s0 math.  In addition to
\&\f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP_EXACT\*(C'\fR is defined as a preprocessor
macro.  On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since there is
very little code that depends on the \fIinexact-flag\fR, you should
normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers call this
option \fB\-ieee_with_inexact\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=\fR\fItrap-mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-trap-mode=trap-mode"

The trap mode can be set to one of four values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that are enabled
are the ones that cannot be disabled in software (e.g., division by zero
trap).
.IP "\fBu\fR" 4
.IX Item "u"
In addition to the traps enabled by \fBn\fR, underflow traps are enabled
as well.

\&\fB\-fprm\fR \fIrounding-mode\fR.  The \fIrounding-mode\fR can be one
of:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
Normal \s-1IEEE\s0 rounding mode.  Floating point numbers are rounded towards
the nearest machine number or towards the even machine number in case
of a tie.
.IP "\fBm\fR" 4
.IX Item "m"
Round towards minus infinity.
.IP "\fBc\fR" 4
.IX Item "c"
Chopped rounding mode.  Floating point numbers are rounded towards zero.
.IP "\fBd\fR" 4
.IX Item "d"
Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating point control register
(\fIfpcr\fR, see Alpha architecture reference manual) controls the
rounding mode in effect.  The C library initializes this register for
rounding towards plus infinity.  Thus, unless your program modifies the
\&\fIfpcr\fR, \fBd\fR corresponds to round towards plus infinity.

.IP "\fB\-mtrap\-precision=\fR\fItrap-precision\fR" 4

In the Alpha architecture, floating point traps are imprecise.  This
means without software assistance it is impossible to recover from a
floating trap and program execution normally needs to be terminated.
\&\s-1GCC\s0 can generate code that can assist operating system trap handlers
in determining the exact location that caused a floating point trap.
Depending on the requirements of an application, different levels of
precisions can be selected:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBp\fR" 4
.IX Item "p"
Program precision.  This option is the default and means a trap handler
can only identify which program caused a floating point exception.
.IP "\fBf\fR" 4
.IX Item "f"
Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the function that
caused a floating point exception.
.IP "\fBi\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-mieee\-conformant\fR" 4

This option marks the generated code as \s-1IEEE\s0 conformant.  You must not
use this option unless you also specify \fB\-mtrap\-precision=i\fR and either
\&\fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=su\fR or \fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=sui\fR.  Its only effect
is to emit the line \fB.eflag 48\fR in the function prologue of the
generated assembly file.  Under \s-1DEC\s0 Unix, this has the effect that
IEEE-conformant math library routines will be linked in.
.IP "\fB\-mbuild\-constants\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbuild-constants"
Normally \s-1GCC\s0 examines a 32\- or 64\-bit integer constant to
see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
instructions.  If it cannot, it will output the constant as a literal and
generate code to load it from the data segment at runtime.
.Sp
Use this option to require \s-1GCC\s0 to construct \fIall\fR integer constants
using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is six).
.Sp
You would typically use this option to build a shared library dynamic
loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself in memory

Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol relocations
except via assembler macros.  Use of these macros does not allow
optimal instruction scheduling.  \s-1GNU\s0 binutils as of version 2.12
supports a new syntax that allows the compiler to explicitly mark
which relocations should apply to which instructions.  This option
is mostly useful for debugging, as \s-1GCC\s0 detects the capabilities of
the assembler when it is built and sets the default accordingly.

.IX Item "-mlarge-data"
.PD
When \fB\-mexplicit\-relocs\fR is in effect, static data is
accessed via \fIgp-relative\fR relocations.  When \fB\-msmall\-data\fR
is used, objects 8 bytes long or smaller are placed in a \fIsmall data area\fR
(the \f(CW\*(C`.sdata\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`.sbss\*(C'\fR sections) and are accessed via
16\-bit relocations off of the \f(CW$gp\fR register.  This limits the
size of the small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be
directly accessed via a single instruction.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-mlarge\-data\fR.  With this option the data area
is limited to just below 2GB.  Programs that require more than 2GB of
data must use \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`mmap\*(C'\fR to allocate the data in the
heap instead of in the program's data segment.
.Sp
When generating code for shared libraries, \fB\-fpic\fR implies

.IX Item "-msmall-text"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mlarge\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlarge-text"
.PD
When \fB\-msmall\-text\fR is used, the compiler assumes that the
code of the entire program (or shared library) fits in 4MB, and is
thus reachable with a branch instruction.  When \fB\-msmall\-data\fR
is used, the compiler can assume that all local symbols share the
same \f(CW$gp\fR value, and thus reduce the number of instructions
required for a function call from 4 to 1.

Select the \s-1FDPIC\s0 \s-1ABI\s0, that uses function descriptors to represent
pointers to functions.  Without any PIC/PIE\-related options, it
implies \fB\-fPIE\fR.  With \fB\-fpic\fR or \fB\-fpie\fR, it
assumes \s-1GOT\s0 entries and small data are within a 12\-bit range from the

Enable the use of \f(CW\*(C`GPREL\*(C'\fR relocations in the \s-1FDPIC\s0 \s-1ABI\s0 for data
that is known to be in read-only sections.  It's enabled by default,
except for \fB\-fpic\fR or \fB\-fpie\fR: even though it may help
make the global offset table smaller, it trades 1 instruction for 4.
With \fB\-fPIC\fR or \fB\-fPIE\fR, it trades 3 instructions for 4,
one of which may be shared by multiple symbols, and it avoids the need
for a \s-1GOT\s0 entry for the referenced symbol, so it's more likely to be a

Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
\&\fBWarning:\fR the requisite libraries are not available for all \s-1HPPA\s0

.Sp
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile \fIall\fR of a program with

options are available under HP-UX and \s-1HI\-UX\s0.
.IP "\fB\-mgnu\-ld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mgnu-ld"
Use \s-1GNU\s0 ld specific options.  This passes \fB\-shared\fR to ld when
building a shared library.  It is the default when \s-1GCC\s0 is configured,
explicitly or implicitly, with the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.  This option does not
have any affect on which ld is called, it only changes what parameters
are passed to that ld.  The ld that is called is determined by the
\&\fB\-\-with\-ld\fR configure option, \s-1GCC\s0's program search path, and
finally by the user's \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  The linker used by \s-1GCC\s0 can be printed
using \fBwhich `gcc \-print\-prog\-name=ld`\fR.  This option is only available

.IP "\fB\-mhp\-ld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhp-ld"
Use \s-1HP\s0 ld specific options.  This passes \fB\-b\fR to ld when building
a shared library and passes \fB+Accept TypeMismatch\fR to ld on all
links.  It is the default when \s-1GCC\s0 is configured, explicitly or
implicitly, with the \s-1HP\s0 linker.  This option does not have any affect on
which ld is called, it only changes what parameters are passed to that
ld.  The ld that is called is determined by the \fB\-\-with\-ld\fR
configure option, \s-1GCC\s0's program search path, and finally by the user's
\&\fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  The linker used by \s-1GCC\s0 can be printed using \fBwhich
`gcc \-print\-prog\-name=ld`\fR.  This option is only available on the 64 bit
HP-UX \s-1GCC\s0, i.e. configured with \fBhppa*64*\-*\-hpux*\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a call
is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default is to generate
long calls only when the distance from the call site to the beginning
of the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a
predefined limit set by the branch type being used.  The limits for
normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes, respectively for the
\&\s-1PA\s0 2.0 and \s-1PA\s0 1.X architectures.  Sibcalls are always limited at
240,000 bytes.
.Sp
Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using the
\&\fB\-ffunction\-sections\fR option, or when using the \fB\-mgas\fR
and \fB\-mno\-portable\-runtime\fR options together under HP-UX with
the \s-1SOM\s0 linker.
.Sp
It is normally not desirable to use this option as it will degrade
performance.  However, it may be useful in large applications,
particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.
.Sp
The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the
assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The
impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small.
However, an indirect call is used on 32\-bit \s-1ELF\s0 systems in pic code
and it is quite long.
.IP "\fB\-munix=\fR\fIunix-std\fR" 4
.IX Item "-munix=unix-std"
Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the specified
\&\s-1UNIX\s0 standard.  The choices for \fIunix-std\fR are \fB93\fR, \fB95\fR

.Sp
It is \fIimportant\fR to note that this option changes the interfaces
for various library routines.  It also affects the operational behavior
of the C library.  Thus, \fIextreme\fR care is needed in using this
option.
.Sp
Library code that is intended to operate with more than one \s-1UNIX\s0
standard must test, set and restore the variable \fI_\|_xpg4_extended_mask\fR
as appropriate.  Most \s-1GNU\s0 software doesn't provide this capability.
.IP "\fB\-nolibdld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nolibdld"
Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the
\&\fB\-static\fR option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.
.IP "\fB\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static"
The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus,
when the \fB\-static\fR option is specified, special link options
are needed to resolve this dependency.
.Sp
On HP-UX 10 and later, the \s-1GCC\s0 driver adds the necessary options to
link with libdld.sl when the \fB\-static\fR option is specified.
This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64\-bit port,
the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The
\&\fB\-nolibdld\fR option can be used to prevent the \s-1GCC\s0 driver from
adding these link options.

\fIIntel 386 and \s-1AMD\s0 x86\-64 Options\fR
.IX Subsection "Intel 386 and AMD x86-64 Options"
.PP
These \fB\-m\fR options are defined for the i386 and x86\-64 family of
computers:
.IP "\fB\-mtune=\fR\fIcpu-type\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtune=cpu-type"
Tune to \fIcpu-type\fR everything applicable about the generated code, except
for the \s-1ABI\s0 and the set of available instructions.  The choices for
\&\fIcpu-type\fR are:
.RS 4
.IP "\fIgeneric\fR" 4
.IX Item "generic"
Produce code optimized for the most common \s-1IA32/AMD64/EM64T\s0 processors.
If you know the \s-1CPU\s0 on which your code will run, then you should use
the corresponding \fB\-mtune\fR option instead of
\&\fB\-mtune=generic\fR.  But, if you do not know exactly what \s-1CPU\s0 users
of your application will have, then you should use this option.
.Sp
As new processors are deployed in the marketplace, the behavior of this
option will change.  Therefore, if you upgrade to a newer version of
\&\s-1GCC\s0, the code generated option will change to reflect the processors
that were most common when that version of \s-1GCC\s0 was released.
.Sp
There is no \fB\-march=generic\fR option because \fB\-march\fR
indicates the instruction set the compiler can use, and there is no
generic instruction set applicable to all processors.  In contrast,
\&\fB\-mtune\fR indicates the processor (or, in this case, collection of
processors) for which the code is optimized.
.IP "\fInative\fR" 4
.IX Item "native"
This selects the \s-1CPU\s0 to tune for at compilation time by determining
the processor type of the compiling machine.  Using \fB\-mtune=native\fR
will produce code optimized for the local machine under the constraints
of the selected instruction set.  Using \fB\-march=native\fR will
enable all instruction subsets supported by the local machine (hence
the result might not run on different machines).

While picking a specific \fIcpu-type\fR will schedule things appropriately

being used.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-march=\fR\fIcpu-type\fR" 4

Generate instructions for the machine type \fIcpu-type\fR.  The choices

Generate floating point arithmetics for selected unit \fIunit\fR.  The choices
for \fIunit\fR are:
.RS 4
.IP "\fB387\fR" 4
.IX Item "387"
Use the standard 387 floating point coprocessor present majority of chips and
emulated otherwise.  Code compiled with this option will run almost everywhere.
The temporary results are computed in 80bit precision instead of precision
specified by the type resulting in slightly different results compared to most
of other chips.  See \fB\-ffloat\-store\fR for more detailed description.
.Sp
This is the default choice for i386 compiler.
.IP "\fBsse\fR" 4
.IX Item "sse"
Use scalar floating point instructions present in the \s-1SSE\s0 instruction set.
This instruction set is supported by Pentium3 and newer chips, in the \s-1AMD\s0 line
by Athlon\-4, Athlon-xp and Athlon-mp chips.  The earlier version of \s-1SSE\s0
instruction set supports only single precision arithmetics, thus the double and
extended precision arithmetics is still done using 387.  Later version, present
only in Pentium4 and the future \s-1AMD\s0 x86\-64 chips supports double precision
arithmetics too.
.Sp
For the i386 compiler, you need to use \fB\-march=\fR\fIcpu-type\fR, \fB\-msse\fR
or \fB\-msse2\fR switches to enable \s-1SSE\s0 extensions and make this option
effective.  For the x86\-64 compiler, these extensions are enabled by default.
.Sp
The resulting code should be considerably faster in the majority of cases and avoid
the numerical instability problems of 387 code, but may break some existing
code that expects temporaries to be 80bit.
.Sp
This is the default choice for the x86\-64 compiler.
.IP "\fBsse,387\fR" 4
.IX Item "sse,387"
Attempt to utilize both instruction sets at once.  This effectively double the
amount of available registers and on chips with separate execution units for
387 and \s-1SSE\s0 the execution resources too.  Use this option with care, as it is
still experimental, because the \s-1GCC\s0 register allocator does not model separate
functional units well resulting in instable performance.

.IP "\fB\-msoft\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-float"
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
\&\fBWarning:\fR the requisite libraries are not part of \s-1GCC\s0.
Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
this can't be done directly in cross\-compilation.  You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross\-compilation.
.Sp
On machines where a function returns floating point results in the 80387
register stack, some floating point opcodes may be emitted even if
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-fp\-ret\-in\-387\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-fp-ret-in-387"
Do not use the \s-1FPU\s0 registers for return values of functions.
.Sp
The usual calling convention has functions return values of types
\&\f(CW\*(C`float\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR in an \s-1FPU\s0 register, even if there
is no \s-1FPU\s0.  The idea is that the operating system should emulate
an \s-1FPU\s0.
.Sp
The option \fB\-mno\-fp\-ret\-in\-387\fR causes such values to be returned
in ordinary \s-1CPU\s0 registers instead.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-fancy\-math\-387\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-fancy-math-387"
Some 387 emulators do not support the \f(CW\*(C`sin\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`cos\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`sqrt\*(C'\fR instructions for the 387.  Specify this option to avoid
generating those instructions.  This option is the default on FreeBSD,
OpenBSD and NetBSD.  This option is overridden when \fB\-march\fR
indicates that the target cpu will always have an \s-1FPU\s0 and so the
instruction will not need emulation.  As of revision 2.6.1, these
instructions are not generated unless you also use the
\&\fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR switch.
.IP "\fB\-malign\-double\fR" 4
.IX Item "-malign-double"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-align\-double\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-align-double"

Control whether \s-1GCC\s0 aligns \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`long long\*(C'\fR variables on a two word boundary or a one word
boundary.  Aligning \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR variables on a two word boundary will
produce code that runs somewhat faster on a \fBPentium\fR at the
expense of more memory.
.Sp
On x86\-64, \fB\-malign\-double\fR is enabled by default.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR if you use the \fB\-malign\-double\fR switch,
structures containing the above types will be aligned differently than
the published application binary interface specifications for the 386
and will not be binary compatible with structures in code compiled
without that switch.
.IP "\fB\-m96bit\-long\-double\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m96bit-long-double"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-m128bit\-long\-double\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m128bit-long-double"
.PD
These switches control the size of \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR type.  The i386
application binary interface specifies the size to be 96 bits,
so \fB\-m96bit\-long\-double\fR is the default in 32 bit mode.
.Sp
Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) would prefer \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR
to be aligned to an 8 or 16 byte boundary.  In arrays or structures
conforming to the \s-1ABI\s0, this would not be possible.  So specifying a
\&\fB\-m128bit\-long\-double\fR will align \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR
to a 16 byte boundary by padding the \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR with an additional
32 bit zero.
.Sp
In the x86\-64 compiler, \fB\-m128bit\-long\-double\fR is the default choice as
its \s-1ABI\s0 specifies that \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR is to be aligned on 16 byte boundary.
.Sp
Notice that neither of these options enable any extra precision over the x87
standard of 80 bits for a \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR if you override the default value for your target \s-1ABI\s0, the
structures and arrays containing \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR variables will change
their size as well as function calling convention for function taking
\&\f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR will be modified.  Hence they will not be binary
compatible with arrays or structures in code compiled without that switch.
.IP "\fB\-mmlarge\-data\-threshold=\fR\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mmlarge-data-threshold=number"
When \fB\-mcmodel=medium\fR is specified, the data greater than

Control whether \s-1GCC\s0 places uninitialized local variables into the

into \f(CW\*(C`bss\*(C'\fR.  These options are meaningful only on System V Release 3.
.IP "\fB\-mrtd\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mrtd"
Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions that
take a fixed number of arguments return with the \f(CW\*(C`ret\*(C'\fR \fInum\fR
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This saves one
instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop the arguments
there.
.Sp
You can specify that an individual function is called with this calling
sequence with the function attribute \fBstdcall\fR.  You can also
override the \fB\-mrtd\fR option by using the function attribute
\&\fBcdecl\fR.  
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR this calling convention is incompatible with the one
normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call
libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.
.Sp
Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR);
otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
functions.
.Sp
In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)
.IP "\fB\-mregparm=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mregparm=num"
Control how many registers are used to pass integer arguments.  By
default, no registers are used to pass arguments, and at most 3
registers can be used.  You can control this behavior for a specific
function by using the function attribute \fBregparm\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR if you use this switch, and
\&\fInum\fR is nonzero, then you must build all modules with the same
value, including any libraries.  This includes the system libraries and
startup modules.
.IP "\fB\-msseregparm\fR" 4

\&\fBWarning:\fR if you use this switch then you must build all
modules with the same value, including any libraries.  This includes

.IP "\fB\-mstackrealign\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstackrealign"
Realign the stack at entry.  On the Intel x86, the
\&\fB\-mstackrealign\fR option will generate an alternate prologue and
epilogue that realigns the runtime stack.  This supports mixing legacy
codes that keep a 4\-byte aligned stack with modern codes that keep a
16\-byte stack for \s-1SSE\s0 compatibility.  The alternate prologue and
epilogue are slower and bigger than the regular ones, and the
alternate prologue requires an extra scratch register; this lowers the
number of registers available if used in conjunction with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`regparm\*(C'\fR attribute.  The \fB\-mstackrealign\fR option is
incompatible with the nested function prologue; this is considered a
hard error.  See also the attribute \f(CW\*(C`force_align_arg_pointer\*(C'\fR,
applicable to individual functions.
.IP "\fB\-mpreferred\-stack\-boundary=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpreferred-stack-boundary=num"
Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to \fInum\fR
byte boundary.  If \fB\-mpreferred\-stack\-boundary\fR is not specified,
the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).
.Sp
On Pentium and PentiumPro, \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR values
should be aligned to an 8 byte boundary (see \fB\-malign\-double\fR) or
suffer significant run time performance penalties.  On Pentium \s-1III\s0, the
Streaming \s-1SIMD\s0 Extension (\s-1SSE\s0) data type \f(CW\*(C`_\|_m128\*(C'\fR may not work
properly if it is not 16 byte aligned.
.Sp
To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary
must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack.
Further, every function must be generated such that it keeps the stack
aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred
stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
boundary will most likely misalign the stack.  It is recommended that
libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.
.Sp
This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally
increases code size.  Code that is sensitive to stack space usage, such
as embedded systems and operating system kernels, may want to reduce the
preferred alignment to \fB\-mpreferred\-stack\-boundary=2\fR.

Do not use a so called red zone for x86\-64 code.  The red zone is mandated
by the x86\-64 \s-1ABI\s0, it is a 128\-byte area beyond the location of the
stack pointer that will not be modified by signal or interrupt handlers
and therefore can be used for temporary data without adjusting the stack
pointer.  The flag \fB\-mno\-red\-zone\fR disables this red zone.

Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
that take a fixed number of arguments return with the \f(CW\*(C`rtd\*(C'\fR

saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
the arguments there.

This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally
used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
compiled with the Unix compiler.

Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR);
otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
functions.

The \s-1ISA\s0 names are:
\&\fBmips1\fR, \fBmips2\fR, \fBmips3\fR, \fBmips4\fR,
\&\fBmips32\fR, \fBmips32r2\fR, and \fBmips64\fR.
The processor names are:

The special value \fBfrom-abi\fR selects the
most compatible architecture for the selected \s-1ABI\s0 (that is,
\&\fBmips1\fR for 32\-bit ABIs and \fBmips3\fR for 64\-bit ABIs).
.Sp
In processor names, a final \fB000\fR can be abbreviated as \fBk\fR
(for example, \fB\-march=r2k\fR).  Prefixes are optional, and
\&\fBvr\fR may be written \fBr\fR.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 defines two macros based on the value of this option.  The first
is \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR, which gives the name of target architecture, as
a string.  The second has the form \fB_MIPS_ARCH_\fR\fIfoo\fR,
where \fIfoo\fR is the capitalized value of \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR.
For example, \fB\-march=r2000\fR will set \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR
to \fB\*(L"r2000\*(R"\fR and define the macro \fB_MIPS_ARCH_R2000\fR.
.Sp
Note that the \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR macro uses the processor names given
above.  In other words, it will have the full prefix and will not
abbreviate \fB000\fR as \fBk\fR.  In the case of \fBfrom-abi\fR,
the macro names the resolved architecture (either \fB\*(L"mips1\*(R"\fR or
\&\fB\*(L"mips3\*(R"\fR).  It names the default architecture when no
\&\fB\-march\fR option is given.
.IP "\fB\-mtune=\fR\fIarch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtune=arch"
Optimize for \fIarch\fR.  Among other things, this option controls
the way instructions are scheduled, and the perceived cost of arithmetic
operations.  The list of \fIarch\fR values is the same as for
\&\fB\-march\fR.
.Sp
When this option is not used, \s-1GCC\s0 will optimize for the processor
specified by \fB\-march\fR.  By using \fB\-march\fR and
\&\fB\-mtune\fR together, it is possible to generate code that will
run on a family of processors, but optimize the code for one
particular member of that family.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mtune\fR defines the macros \fB_MIPS_TUNE\fR and

All \fB\-mabicalls\fR code has traditionally been position\-independent,
regardless of options like \fB\-fPIC\fR and \fB\-fpic\fR.  However,
as an extension, the \s-1GNU\s0 toolchain allows executables to use absolute
accesses for locally-binding symbols.  It can also use shorter \s-1GP\s0
initialization sequences and generate direct calls to locally-defined
functions.  This mode is selected by \fB\-mno\-shared\fR.

\&\fB\-mno\-shared\fR depends on binutils 2.16 or higher and generates
objects that can only be linked by the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.  However, the option
does not affect the \s-1ABI\s0 of the final executable; it only affects the \s-1ABI\s0

\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally uses a single instruction to load values from the \s-1GOT\s0.
While this is relatively efficient, it will only work if the \s-1GOT\s0
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger will cause the linker
to report an error such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar
.Ve
.Sp
If this happens, you should recompile your code with \fB\-mxgot\fR.
It should then work with very large GOTs, although it will also be
less efficient, since it will take three instructions to fetch the
value of a global symbol.
.Sp
Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs.  If you have such a
linker, you should only need to use \fB\-mxgot\fR when a single object
file accesses more than 64k's worth of \s-1GOT\s0 entries.  Very few do.

the \s-1ABI\s0.  All the supported ABIs use 32\-bit \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fRs.  The n64 \s-1ABI\s0

\&\s-1GCC\s0 supports two related instruction set architectures for the

instructions supported by the \fBrios\fR chip set used in the original
\&\s-1RS/6000\s0 systems and the \fIPowerPC\fR instruction set is the
architecture of the Freescale MPC5xx, MPC6xx, MPC8xx microprocessors, and
the \s-1IBM\s0 4xx, 6xx, and follow-on microprocessors.
.Sp
Neither architecture is a subset of the other.  However there is a
large common subset of instructions supported by both.  An \s-1MQ\s0
register is included in processors supporting the \s-1POWER\s0 architecture.
.Sp
You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the
processor you are using.  The default value of these options is
determined when configuring \s-1GCC\s0.  Specifying the
\&\fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIcpu_type\fR overrides the specification of these
options.  We recommend you use the \fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIcpu_type\fR option
rather than the options listed above.
.Sp
The \fB\-mpower\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate instructions that
are found only in the \s-1POWER\s0 architecture and to use the \s-1MQ\s0 register.
Specifying \fB\-mpower2\fR implies \fB\-power\fR and also allows \s-1GCC\s0
to generate instructions that are present in the \s-1POWER2\s0 architecture but
not the original \s-1POWER\s0 architecture.
.Sp
The \fB\-mpowerpc\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate instructions that
are found only in the 32\-bit subset of the PowerPC architecture.
Specifying \fB\-mpowerpc\-gpopt\fR implies \fB\-mpowerpc\fR and also allows
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
General Purpose group, including floating-point square root.  Specifying
\&\fB\-mpowerpc\-gfxopt\fR implies \fB\-mpowerpc\fR and also allows \s-1GCC\s0 to
use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics
group, including floating-point select.
.Sp
The \fB\-mmfcrf\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate the move from
condition register field instruction implemented on the \s-1POWER4\s0
processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.01
architecture.
The \fB\-mpopcntb\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate the popcount and
double precision \s-1FP\s0 reciprocal estimate instruction implemented on the
\&\s-1POWER5\s0 processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.02
architecture.
The \fB\-mfprnd\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate the \s-1FP\s0 round to
integer instructions implemented on the \s-1POWER5+\s0 processor and other
processors that support the PowerPC V2.03 architecture.
.Sp
The \fB\-mpowerpc64\fR option allows \s-1GCC\s0 to generate the additional
64\-bit instructions that are found in the full PowerPC64 architecture
and to treat GPRs as 64\-bit, doubleword quantities.  \s-1GCC\s0 defaults to
\&\fB\-mno\-powerpc64\fR.

If you specify both \fB\-mno\-power\fR and \fB\-mno\-powerpc\fR, \s-1GCC\s0
will use only the instructions in the common subset of both
architectures plus some special \s-1AIX\s0 common-mode calls, and will not use
the \s-1MQ\s0 register.  Specifying both \fB\-mpower\fR and \fB\-mpowerpc\fR
permits \s-1GCC\s0 to use any instruction from either architecture and to
allow use of the \s-1MQ\s0 register; specify this for the Motorola \s-1MPC601\s0.

Modify generation of the \s-1TOC\s0 (Table Of Contents), which is created for
every executable file.  The \fB\-mfull\-toc\fR option is selected by
default.  In that case, \s-1GCC\s0 will allocate at least one \s-1TOC\s0 entry for
each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  \s-1GCC\s0
will also place floating-point constants in the \s-1TOC\s0.  However, only
16,384 entries are available in the \s-1TOC\s0.
.Sp
If you receive a linker error message that saying you have overflowed
the available \s-1TOC\s0 space, you can reduce the amount of \s-1TOC\s0 space used
with the \fB\-mno\-fp\-in\-toc\fR and \fB\-mno\-sum\-in\-toc\fR options.
\&\fB\-mno\-fp\-in\-toc\fR prevents \s-1GCC\s0 from putting floating-point
constants in the \s-1TOC\s0 and \fB\-mno\-sum\-in\-toc\fR forces \s-1GCC\s0 to
generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at
run-time instead of putting that sum into the \s-1TOC\s0.  You may specify one
or both of these options.  Each causes \s-1GCC\s0 to produce very slightly
slower and larger code at the expense of conserving \s-1TOC\s0 space.
.Sp
If you still run out of space in the \s-1TOC\s0 even when you specify both of
these options, specify \fB\-mminimal\-toc\fR instead.  This option causes
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to make only one \s-1TOC\s0 entry for every file.  When you specify this
option, \s-1GCC\s0 will produce code that is slower and larger but which
uses extremely little \s-1TOC\s0 space.  You may wish to use this option

Produce code that conforms more closely to \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1XL\s0 compiler semantics

double in 128\-bit long double value is properly rounded when comparing
values and converting to double.  Use \s-1XL\s0 symbol names for long double
support routines.
.Sp
The \s-1AIX\s0 calling convention was extended but not initially documented to
handle an obscure K&R C case of calling a function that takes the
address of its arguments with fewer arguments than declared.  \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1XL\s0
compilers access floating point arguments which do not fit in the
\&\s-1RSA\s0 from the stack when a subroutine is compiled without
optimization.  Because always storing floating-point arguments on the

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) adhere to the
Embedded Applications Binary Interface (eabi) which is a set of
modifications to the System V.4 specifications.  Selecting \fB\-meabi\fR
means that the stack is aligned to an 8 byte boundary, a function
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_eabi\*(C'\fR is called to from \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR to set up the eabi
environment, and the \fB\-msdata\fR option can use both \f(CW\*(C`r2\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR to point to two separate small data areas.  Selecting
\&\fB\-mno\-eabi\fR means that the stack is aligned to a 16 byte boundary,
do not call an initialization function from \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR, and the

.PD
By default assume that all calls are far away so that a longer more
expensive calling sequence is required.  This is required for calls
further than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from the current location.
A short call will be generated if the compiler knows
the call cannot be that far away.  This setting can be overridden by
the \f(CW\*(C`shortcall\*(C'\fR function attribute, or by \f(CW\*(C`#pragma
longcall(0)\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and generating
glue code on the fly.  On these systems, long calls are unnecessary and
generate slower code.  As of this writing, the \s-1AIX\s0 linker can do this,
as can the \s-1GNU\s0 linker for PowerPC/64.  It is planned to add this feature
to the \s-1GNU\s0 linker for 32\-bit PowerPC systems as well.
.Sp
On Darwin/PPC systems, \f(CW\*(C`#pragma longcall\*(C'\fR will generate \*(L"jbsr
callee, L42\*(R", plus a \*(L"branch island\*(R" (glue code).  The two target
addresses represent the callee and the \*(L"branch island\*(R".  The
Darwin/PPC linker will prefer the first address and generate a \*(L"bl
callee\*(R" if the \s-1PPC\s0 \*(L"bl\*(R" instruction will reach the callee directly;
otherwise, the linker will generate \*(L"bl L42\*(R" to call the \*(L"branch
island\*(R".  The \*(L"branch island\*(R" is appended to the body of the
calling function; it computes the full 32\-bit address of the callee
and jumps to it.
.Sp
On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the compiler emit to
the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker decides whether
to use or discard it.
.Sp
In the future, we may cause \s-1GCC\s0 to ignore all longcall specifications
when the linker is known to generate glue.

Store (do not store) the address of the caller's frame as backchain pointer
into the callee's stack frame.
A backchain may be needed to allow debugging using tools that do not understand
\&\s-1DWARF\-2\s0 call frame information.
When \fB\-mno\-packed\-stack\fR is in effect, the backchain pointer is stored
at the bottom of the stack frame; when \fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR is in effect,
the backchain is placed into the topmost word of the 96/160 byte register
save area.
.Sp
In general, code compiled with \fB\-mbackchain\fR is call-compatible with
code compiled with \fB\-mmo\-backchain\fR; however, use of the backchain
for debugging purposes usually requires that the whole binary is built with
\&\fB\-mbackchain\fR.  Note that the combination of \fB\-mbackchain\fR,
\&\fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR and \fB\-mhard\-float\fR is not supported.  In order

Use (do not use) the packed stack layout.  When \fB\-mno\-packed\-stack\fR is
specified, the compiler uses the all fields of the 96/160 byte register save
area only for their default purpose; unused fields still take up stack space.
When \fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR is specified, register save slots are densely
packed at the top of the register save area; unused space is reused for other
purposes, allowing for more efficient use of the available stack space.
However, when \fB\-mbackchain\fR is also in effect, the topmost word of
the save area is always used to store the backchain, and the return address
register is always saved two words below the backchain.
.Sp
As long as the stack frame backchain is not used, code generated with
\&\fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR is call-compatible with code generated with
\&\fB\-mno\-packed\-stack\fR.  Note that some non-FSF releases of \s-1GCC\s0 2.95 for
S/390 or zSeries generated code that uses the stack frame backchain at run
time, not just for debugging purposes.  Such code is not call-compatible
with code compiled with \fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR.  Also, note that the
combination of \fB\-mbackchain\fR,
\&\fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR and \fB\-mhard\-float\fR is not supported.  In order

These arguments always have to be used in conjunction.  If they are present the s390
back end emits additional instructions in the function prologue which trigger a trap
if the stack size is \fIstack-guard\fR bytes above the \fIstack-size\fR
(remember that the stack on s390 grows downward).  These options are intended to
be used to help debugging stack overflow problems.  The additionally emitted code
causes only little overhead and hence can also be used in production like systems
without greater performance degradation.  The given values have to be exact
powers of 2 and \fIstack-size\fR has to be greater than \fIstack-guard\fR without
exceeding 64k.
In order to be efficient the extra code makes the assumption that the stack starts
at an address aligned to the value given by \fIstack-size\fR.

Set the division strategy to use for SHmedia code.  \fIstrategy\fR must be
one of: call, call2, fp, inv, inv:minlat, inv20u, inv20l, inv:call,
inv:call2, inv:fp .
\&\*(L"fp\*(R" performs the operation in floating point.  This has a very high latency,
but needs only a few instructions, so it might be a good choice if
your code has enough easily exploitable \s-1ILP\s0 to allow the compiler to
schedule the floating point instructions together with other instructions.
Division by zero causes a floating point exception.
\&\*(L"inv\*(R" uses integer operations to calculate the inverse of the divisor,
and then multiplies the dividend with the inverse.  This strategy allows
cse and hoisting of the inverse calculation.  Division by zero calculates
an unspecified result, but does not trap.
\&\*(L"inv:minlat\*(R" is a variant of \*(L"inv\*(R" where if no cse / hoisting opportunities
have been found, or if the entire operation has been hoisted to the same
place, the last stages of the inverse calculation are intertwined with the
final multiply to reduce the overall latency, at the expense of using a few
more instructions, and thus offering fewer scheduling opportunities with
other code.
\&\*(L"call\*(R" calls a library function that usually implements the inv:minlat
strategy.
This gives high code density for m5\-*media\-nofpu compilations.
\&\*(L"call2\*(R" uses a different entry point of the same library function, where it
assumes that a pointer to a lookup table has already been set up, which
exposes the pointer load to cse / code hoisting optimizations.
\&\*(L"inv:call\*(R", \*(L"inv:call2\*(R" and \*(L"inv:fp\*(R" all use the \*(L"inv\*(R" algorithm for initial
code generation, but if the code stays unoptimized, revert to the \*(L"call\*(R",
\&\*(L"call2\*(R", or \*(L"fp\*(R" strategies, respectively.  Note that the
potentially-trapping side effect of division by zero is carried by a
separate instruction, so it is possible that all the integer instructions
are hoisted out, but the marker for the side effect stays where it is.
A recombination to fp operations or a call is not possible in that case.
\&\*(L"inv20u\*(R" and \*(L"inv20l\*(R" are variants of the \*(L"inv:minlat\*(R" strategy.  In the case
that the inverse calculation was nor separated from the multiply, they speed
up division where the dividend fits into 20 bits (plus sign where applicable),
by inserting a test to skip a number of operations in this case; this test
slows down the case of larger dividends.  inv20u assumes the case of a such
a small dividend to be unlikely, and inv20l assumes it to be likely.

division strategies, and the compiler will still expect the same
sets of input/output/clobbered registers as if this option was not present.
.IP "\fB\-madjust\-unroll\fR" 4
.IX Item "-madjust-unroll"
Throttle unrolling to avoid thrashing target registers.
This option only has an effect if the gcc code base supports the
\&\s-1TARGET_ADJUST_UNROLL_MAX\s0 target hook.
.IP "\fB\-mindexed\-addressing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mindexed-addressing"
Enable the use of the indexed addressing mode for SHmedia32/SHcompact.
This is only safe if the hardware and/or \s-1OS\s0 implement 32 bit wrap-around
semantics for the indexed addressing mode.  The architecture allows the
implementation of processors with 64 bit \s-1MMU\s0, which the \s-1OS\s0 could use to
get 32 bit addressing, but since no current hardware implementation supports
this or any other way to make the indexed addressing mode safe to use in
the 32 bit \s-1ABI\s0, the default is \-mno\-indexed\-addressing.
.IP "\fB\-mgettrcost=\fR\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mgettrcost=number"
Set the cost assumed for the gettr instruction to \fInumber\fR.
The default is 2 if \fB\-mpt\-fixed\fR is in effect, 100 otherwise.
.IP "\fB\-mpt\-fixed\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpt-fixed"
Assume pt* instructions won't trap.  This will generally generate better
scheduled code, but is unsafe on current hardware.  The current architecture
definition says that ptabs and ptrel trap when the target anded with 3 is 3.
This has the unintentional effect of making it unsafe to schedule ptabs /
ptrel before a branch, or hoist it out of a loop.  For example,
_\|_do_global_ctors, a part of libgcc that runs constructors at program
startup, calls functions in a list which is delimited by \-1.  With the
\&\-mpt\-fixed option, the ptabs will be done before testing against \-1.
That means that all the constructors will be run a bit quicker, but when
the loop comes to the end of the list, the program crashes because ptabs
loads \-1 into a target register.  Since this option is unsafe for any
hardware implementing the current architecture specification, the default
is \-mno\-pt\-fixed.  Unless the user specifies a specific cost with
\&\fB\-mgettrcost\fR, \-mno\-pt\-fixed also implies \fB\-mgettrcost=100\fR;
this deters register allocation using target registers for storing
ordinary integers.
.IP "\fB\-minvalid\-symbols\fR" 4
.IX Item "-minvalid-symbols"
Assume symbols might be invalid.  Ordinary function symbols generated by
the compiler will always be valid to load with movi/shori/ptabs or
movi/shori/ptrel, but with assembler and/or linker tricks it is possible
to generate symbols that will cause ptabs / ptrel to trap.
This option is only meaningful when \fB\-mno\-pt\-fixed\fR is in effect.
It will then prevent cross-basic-block cse, hoisting and most scheduling
of symbol loads.  The default is \fB\-mno\-invalid\-symbols\fR.

Specify \fB\-mapp\-regs\fR to generate output using the global registers
2 through 4, which the \s-1SPARC\s0 \s-1SVR4\s0 \s-1ABI\s0 reserves for applications.  This
is the default.
.Sp
To be fully \s-1SVR4\s0 \s-1ABI\s0 compliant at the cost of some performance loss,

.IX Item "-msoft-float"
.PD
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
\&\fBWarning:\fR the requisite libraries are not available for all \s-1SPARC\s0
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross\-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross\-compilation.  The embedded targets \fBsparc\-*\-aout\fR and
\&\fBsparclite\-*\-*\fR do provide software floating point support.
.Sp
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile \fIall\fR of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile \fIlibgcc.a\fR, the
library that comes with \s-1GCC\s0, with \fB\-msoft\-float\fR in order for
this to work.
.IP "\fB\-mhard\-quad\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhard-quad-float"
Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating point
instructions.
.IP "\fB\-msoft\-quad\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-quad-float"
Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long double)
floating point instructions.  The functions called are those specified
in the \s-1SPARC\s0 \s-1ABI\s0.  This is the default.
.Sp
As of this writing, there are no \s-1SPARC\s0 implementations that have hardware
support for the quad-word floating point instructions.  They all invoke
a trap handler for one of these instructions, and then the trap handler
emulates the effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler overhead,
this is much slower than calling the \s-1ABI\s0 library routines.  Thus the
\&\fB\-msoft\-quad\-float\fR option is the default.

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-munaligned\-doubles\fR" 4
.IX Item "-munaligned-doubles"
.PD
Assume that doubles have 8 byte alignment.  This is the default.
.Sp
With \fB\-munaligned\-doubles\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 assumes that doubles have 8 byte
alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they have an
absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4 byte alignment.
Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility problems with code
generated by other compilers.  It is not the default because it results
in a performance loss, especially for floating point code.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-faster\-structs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-faster-structs"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mfaster\-structs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfaster-structs"
.PD
With \fB\-mfaster\-structs\fR, the compiler assumes that structures
should have 8 byte alignment.  This enables the use of pairs of
\&\f(CW\*(C`ldd\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`std\*(C'\fR instructions for copies in structure
assignment, in place of twice as many \f(CW\*(C`ld\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`st\*(C'\fR pairs.
However, the use of this changed alignment directly violates the \s-1SPARC\s0
\&\s-1ABI\s0.  Thus, it's intended only for use on targets where the developer
acknowledges that their resulting code will not be directly in line with
the rules of the \s-1ABI\s0.
.IP "\fB\-mimpure\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mimpure-text"
\&\fB\-mimpure\-text\fR, used in addition to \fB\-shared\fR, tells
the compiler to not pass \fB\-z text\fR to the linker when linking a
shared object.  Using this option, you can link position-dependent
code into a shared object.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mimpure\-text\fR suppresses the \*(L"relocations remain against
allocatable but non-writable sections\*(R" linker error message.
However, the necessary relocations will trigger copy\-on\-write, and the
shared object is not actually shared across processes.  Instead of
using \fB\-mimpure\-text\fR, you should compile all source code with

By default (unless configured otherwise), \s-1GCC\s0 generates code for the V7
variant of the \s-1SPARC\s0 architecture.  With \fB\-mcpu=cypress\fR, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for the Cypress \s-1CY7C602\s0 chip, as used in the
SPARCStation/SPARCServer 3xx series.  This is also appropriate for the older
SPARCStation 1, 2, \s-1IPX\s0 etc.
.Sp
With \fB\-mcpu=v8\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 generates code for the V8 variant of the \s-1SPARC\s0

the integer multiply and integer divide instructions which exist in \s-1SPARC\-V8\s0
but not in \s-1SPARC\-V7\s0.  With \fB\-mcpu=supersparc\fR, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the SuperSPARC chip, as used in the SPARCStation 10, 1000 and
2000 series.
.Sp
With \fB\-mcpu=sparclite\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 generates code for the SPARClite variant of

and scan (\f(CW\*(C`ffs\*(C'\fR) instructions which exist in SPARClite but not in \s-1SPARC\-V7\s0.
With \fB\-mcpu=f930\fR, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the
Fujitsu \s-1MB86930\s0 chip, which is the original SPARClite, with no \s-1FPU\s0.  With

iteration count on the C3x is 2^{23 + 1} (but who iterates loops more than
2^{23} times on the C3x?).  Note that \s-1GCC\s0 will try to reverse a loop so
that it can utilize the decrement and branch instruction, but will give
up if there is more than one memory reference in the loop.  Thus a loop

Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
instructions in the floating-point option.  This has no effect if the
floating-point option is not also enabled.  Disabling fused multiply/add
and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler to use separate
instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations.  This may be
desirable in some cases where strict \s-1IEEE\s0 754\-compliant results are
required: the fused multiply add/subtract instructions do not round the
intermediate result, thereby producing results with \fImore\fR bits of

When this option is enabled, \s-1GCC\s0 instructs the assembler to
automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties at the
expense of some code density.  The assembler attempts to widen density
instructions to align branch targets and the instructions following call
instructions.  If there are not enough preceding safe density
instructions to align a target, no widening will be performed.  The
default is \fB\-mtarget\-align\fR.  These options do not affect the

When this option is enabled, \s-1GCC\s0 instructs the assembler to translate
direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine that the target
of a direct call is in the range allowed by the call instruction.  This
translation typically occurs for calls to functions in other source
files.  Specifically, the assembler translates a direct \f(CW\*(C`CALL\*(C'\fR
instruction into an \f(CW\*(C`L32R\*(C'\fR followed by a \f(CW\*(C`CALLX\*(C'\fR instruction.
The default is \fB\-mno\-longcalls\fR.  This option should be used in
programs where the call target can potentially be out of range.  This
option is implemented in the assembler, not the compiler, so the
assembly code generated by \s-1GCC\s0 will still show direct call
instructions\-\-\-look at the disassembled object code to see the actual
instructions.  Note that the assembler will use an indirect call for
every cross-file call, not just those that really will be out of range.

This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations.
.IP "\fB\-fwrapv\fR" 4

This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around

front\-end, as required by the Java language specification.
.IP "\fB\-fexceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexceptions"
Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies \s-1GCC\s0 will generate frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, \s-1GCC\s0 will enable it by default for languages like
\&\*(C+ which normally require exception handling, and disable it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in \*(C+.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older \*(C+ programs that don't
use exception handling.
.IP "\fB\-fnon\-call\-exceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnon-call-exceptions"
Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows \fItrapping\fR
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating

arbitrary signal handlers such as \f(CW\*(C`SIGALRM\*(C'\fR.

Similar to \fB\-fexceptions\fR, except that it will just generate any needed

In C, allocate even uninitialized global variables in the data section of the

.IP "\fB\-fpic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpic"
Generate position-independent code (\s-1PIC\s0) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (\s-1GOT\s0).  The dynamic
loader resolves the \s-1GOT\s0 entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of \s-1GCC\s0; it is part of the operating system).  If
the \s-1GOT\s0 size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
\&\fB\-fpic\fR does not work; in that case, recompile with \fB\-fPIC\fR
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the \s-1SPARC\s0 and 32k
on the m68k and \s-1RS/6000\s0.  The 386 has no such limit.)
.Sp
Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, \s-1GCC\s0 supports \s-1PIC\s0 for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1RS/6000\s0 is always
position\-independent.

.IP "\fB\-finstrument\-functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finstrument-functions"
Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions will be called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,

function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)

The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.
.Sp
This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls will indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use \fBextern inline\fR in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyways, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)
.Sp
A function may be given the attribute \f(CW\*(C`no_instrument_function\*(C'\fR, in
which case this instrumentation will not be done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).

Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the

a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.
.Sp
Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the

Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,

would grow beyond the value, a signal is raised.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.

For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address \fB0x80000000\fR

change the way C symbols are represented in the object file.  One use
is to help link with legacy assembly code.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR the \fB\-fleading\-underscore\fR switch causes \s-1GCC\s0 to
generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
Not all targets provide complete support for this switch.
.IP "\fB\-ftls\-model=\fR\fImodel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftls-model=model"
Alter the thread-local storage model to be used.
The \fImodel\fR argument should be one of \f(CW\*(C`global\-dynamic\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`local\-dynamic\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`initial\-exec\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`local\-exec\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The default without \fB\-fpic\fR is \f(CW\*(C`initial\-exec\*(C'\fR; with
\&\fB\-fpic\fR the default is \f(CW\*(C`global\-dynamic\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility=\fR\fIdefault|internal|hidden|protected\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility=default|internal|hidden|protected"
Set the default \s-1ELF\s0 image symbol visibility to the specified option\-\-\-all
symbols will be marked with this unless overridden within the code.
Using this feature can very substantially improve linking and
load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized
code, provide near-perfect \s-1API\s0 export and prevent symbol clashes.
It is \fBstrongly\fR recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.
.Sp
Despite the nomenclature, \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR always means public ie;
available to be linked against from outside the shared object.
\&\f(CW\*(C`protected\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`internal\*(C'\fR are pretty useless in real-world
usage so the only other commonly used option will be \f(CW\*(C`hidden\*(C'\fR.
The default if \fB\-fvisibility\fR isn't specified is
\&\f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR, i.e., make every
symbol public\-\-\-this causes the same behavior as previous versions of
\&\s-1GCC\s0.
.Sp
A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring \s-1ELF\s0
symbols have the correct visibility is given by \*(L"How To Write
Shared Libraries\*(R" by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
<\fBhttp://people.redhat.com/~drepper/\fR>)\-\-\-however a superior
solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when
the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
public.  This is the norm with \s-1DLL\s0's on Windows and with \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_ ((visibility("default")))\*(C'\fR instead of
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_declspec(dllexport)\*(C'\fR you get almost identical semantics with
identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with
cross-platform projects.
.Sp
For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility\fR of use.  This works by you enclosing
the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility push(hidden)\fR and
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility pop\fR.
Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed \fBas
part of the \s-1API\s0 interface contract\fR and thus all new code should
always specify visibility when it is not the default ie; declarations
only for use within the local \s-1DSO\s0 should \fBalways\fR be marked explicitly
as hidden as so to avoid \s-1PLT\s0 indirection overheads\-\-\-making this
abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.
Note that due to \s-1ISO\s0 \*(C+ specification requirements, operator new and
operator delete must always be of default visibility.
.Sp
Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say \fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility push(default)\fR
before including any such headers.
.Sp
\&\fBextern\fR declarations are not affected by \fB\-fvisibility\fR, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR with
no modifications.  However, this means that calls to \fBextern\fR
functions with no explicit visibility will use the \s-1PLT\s0, so it is more
effective to use \fB_\|_attribute ((visibility))\fR and/or
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility\fR to tell the compiler which \fBextern\fR
declarations should be treated as hidden.
.Sp
Note that \fB\-fvisibility\fR does affect \*(C+ vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that will
be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default
visibility so that the \fBtype_info\fR nodes will be unified between
the DSOs.
.Sp
An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them
is at <\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility\fR>.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
This section describes several environment variables that affect how \s-1GCC\s0
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.
.PP
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
\&\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-I\fR and \fB\-L\fR.  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of \s-1GCC\s0.
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_CTYPE"
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_MESSAGES"
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_ALL"
.PD
These environment variables control the way that \s-1GCC\s0 uses
localization information that allow \s-1GCC\s0 to work with different
national conventions.  \s-1GCC\s0 inspects the locale categories
\&\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is \fBen_GB.UTF\-8\fR for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in \s-1UTF\-8\s0.
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR environment variable specifies character
classification.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that would otherwise be interpreted as a string
end or escape.
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.
.Sp
If the \fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR; otherwise, \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR
and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR default to the value of the \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, \s-1GCC\s0
defaults to traditional C English behavior.
.IP "\fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "TMPDIR"
If \fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
.IP "\fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "GCC_EXEC_PREFIX"
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
.Sp
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is not set, \s-1GCC\s0 will attempt to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it was invoked with.
.Sp
If \s-1GCC\s0 cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.
.Sp
The default value of \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is
\&\fI\fIprefix\fI/lib/gcc/\fR where \fIprefix\fR is the value
of \f(CW\*(C`prefix\*(C'\fR when you ran the \fIconfigure\fR script.
.Sp
Other prefixes specified with \fB\-B\fR take precedence over this prefix.
.Sp
This prefix is also used for finding files such as \fIcrt0.o\fR that are
used for linking.
.Sp
In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with \fB/usr/local/lib/gcc\fR
(more precisely, with the value of \fB\s-1GCC_INCLUDE_DIR\s0\fR), \s-1GCC\s0 tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with \fB\-Bfoo/\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 will search
\&\fIfoo/bar\fR where it would normally search \fI/usr/local/lib/bar\fR.
These alternate directories are searched first; the standard directories
come next.
.IP "\fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "COMPILER_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LIBRARY_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  When configured as a native compiler,
\&\s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.  Linking
using \s-1GCC\s0 also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the \fB\-l\fR option (but directories specified with
\&\fB\-L\fR come first).
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and \*(C+.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR are recognized:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBC\-JIS\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-JIS"
Recognize \s-1JIS\s0 characters.
.IP "\fBC\-SJIS\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-SJIS"
Recognize \s-1SJIS\s0 characters.
.IP "\fBC\-EUCJP\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-EUCJP"
Recognize \s-1EUCJP\s0 characters.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
If \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler will use mblen and mbtowc as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.
.RE
.PP
Some additional environments variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.
.IP "\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPATH"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBC_INCLUDE_PATH\fR" 4
.IX Item "C_INCLUDE_PATH"
.IP "\fB\s-1CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
.IP "\fB\s-1OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH"
.PD
Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR, in which to look for header files.
The special character, \f(CW\*(C`PATH_SEPARATOR\*(C'\fR, is target-dependent and
determined at \s-1GCC\s0 build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with \fB\-I\fR, but after any paths given with \fB\-I\fR
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.
.Sp
The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with \fB\-isystem\fR, but after any
paths given with \fB\-isystem\fR options on the command line.
.Sp
In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR is \f(CW\*(C`:/special/include\*(C'\fR, that has the same
effect as \fB\-I.\ \-I/special/include\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT"
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.
.Sp
The value of \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
\&\fIfile\fR\fB \fR\fItarget\fR, in which case the rules are written to
file \fIfile\fR using \fItarget\fR as the target name.
.Sp
In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options \fB\-MM\fR and \fB\-MF\fR,
with an optional \fB\-MT\fR switch too.
.IP "\fB\s-1SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES"
This variable is the same as \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
\&\fB\-M\fR rather than \fB\-MM\fR.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.
