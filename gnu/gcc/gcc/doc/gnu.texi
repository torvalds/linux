@node GNU Project
@unnumbered The GNU Project and GNU/Linux

The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like
operating system which is free software: the GNU system.  (GNU is a
recursive acronym for ``GNU's Not Unix''; it is pronounced
``guh-NEW''@.)  Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the
kernel Linux, are now widely used; though these systems are often
referred to as ``Linux'', they are more accurately called GNU/Linux
systems.
