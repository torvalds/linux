@c NOTE: checks/things to do:
@c
@c -have bob do a search in all seven files for "mew" (ideally --mew,
@c  but i may have forgotten the occasional "--"..).
@c     Just checked... all have `--'!  Bob 22Jul96
@c     Use this to search:   grep -n '\-\-mew' *.texi
@c -item/itemx, text after all (sub/sub)section titles, etc..
@c -consider putting the lists of options on pp 17--> etc in columns or
@c  some such.
@c -overfulls.  do a search for "mew" in the files, and you will see
@c   overfulls that i noted but could not deal with.
@c -have to add text:  beginning of chapter 8

@top Introduction
@cindex introduction

This manual documents how to use the GNU compilers,
as well as their features and incompatibilities, and how to report
bugs.  It corresponds to GCC version @value{version-GCC}.
The internals of the GNU compilers, including how to port them to new
targets and some information about how to write front ends for new
languages, are documented in a separate manual.  @xref{Top,,
Introduction, gccint, GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals}.

@node Option Index
@unnumbered Option Index

GCC's command line options are indexed here without any initial @samp{-}
or @samp{--}.  Where an option has both positive and negative forms
(such as @option{-f@var{option}} and @option{-fno-@var{option}}),
relevant entries in the manual are indexed under the most appropriate
form; it may sometimes be useful to look up both forms.
