/* Loop Vectorization Pass.

   This pass tries to vectorize loops. This first implementation focuses on
   simple inner-most loops, with no conditional control flow, and a set of
   simple operations which vector form can be expressed using existing
   tree codes (PLUS, MULT etc).

   For example, the vectorizer transforms the following simple loop:

	short a[N]; short b[N]; short c[N]; int i;

	for (i=0; i<N; i++){
	  a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
	}

   as if it was manually vectorized by rewriting the source code into:

	typedef int __attribute__((mode(V8HI))) v8hi;
	short a[N];  short b[N]; short c[N];   int i;
	v8hi *pa = (v8hi*)a, *pb = (v8hi*)b, *pc = (v8hi*)c;
	v8hi va, vb, vc;

	for (i=0; i<N/8; i++){
	  vb = pb[i];
	  vc = pc[i];
	  va = vb + vc;
	  pa[i] = va;
	}

	The main entry to this pass is vectorize_loops(), in which
   the vectorizer applies a set of analyses on a given set of loops,
   followed by the actual vectorization transformation for the loops that
   had successfully passed the analysis phase.

	Throughout this pass we make a distinction between two types of
   data: scalars (which are represented by SSA_NAMES), and memory references
   ("data-refs"). These two types of data require different handling both 
   during analysis and transformation. The types of data-refs that the 
   vectorizer currently supports are ARRAY_REFS which base is an array DECL 
   (not a pointer), and INDIRECT_REFS through pointers; both array and pointer
   accesses are required to have a  simple (consecutive) access pattern.

   Analysis phase:
   ===============
	The driver for the analysis phase is vect_analyze_loop_nest().
   It applies a set of analyses, some of which rely on the scalar evolution 
   analyzer (scev) developed by Sebastian Pop.

	During the analysis phase the vectorizer records some information
   per stmt in a "stmt_vec_info" struct which is attached to each stmt in the 
   loop, as well as general information about the loop as a whole, which is
   recorded in a "loop_vec_info" struct attached to each loop.

   Transformation phase:
   =====================
	The loop transformation phase scans all the stmts in the loop, and
   creates a vector stmt (or a sequence of stmts) for each scalar stmt S in
   the loop that needs to be vectorized. It insert the vector code sequence
   just before the scalar stmt S, and records a pointer to the vector code
   in STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info) (stmt_info is the stmt_vec_info struct 
   attached to S). This pointer will be used for the vectorization of following
   stmts which use the def of stmt S. Stmt S is removed if it writes to memory;
   otherwise, we rely on dead code elimination for removing it.

	For example, say stmt S1 was vectorized into stmt VS1:

   VS1: vb = px[i];
   S1:	b = x[i];    STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info (S1)) = VS1
   S2:  a = b;

   To vectorize stmt S2, the vectorizer first finds the stmt that defines
   the operand 'b' (S1), and gets the relevant vector def 'vb' from the
   vector stmt VS1 pointed to by STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info (S1)). The
   resulting sequence would be:

   VS1: vb = px[i];
   S1:	b = x[i];	STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info (S1)) = VS1
   VS2: va = vb;
   S2:  a = b;          STMT_VINFO_VEC_STMT (stmt_info (S2)) = VS2

	Operands that are not SSA_NAMEs, are data-refs that appear in 
   load/store operations (like 'x[i]' in S1), and are handled differently.

   Target modeling:
   =================
	Currently the only target specific information that is used is the
   size of the vector (in bytes) - "UNITS_PER_SIMD_WORD". Targets that can 
   support different sizes of vectors, for now will need to specify one value 
   for "UNITS_PER_SIMD_WORD". More flexibility will be added in the future.

	Since we only vectorize operations which vector form can be
   expressed using existing tree codes, to verify that an operation is
   supported, the vectorizer checks the relevant optab at the relevant
   machine_mode (e.g, add_optab->handlers[(int) V8HImode].insn_code). If
   the value found is CODE_FOR_nothing, then there's no target support, and
   we can't vectorize the stmt.

/* Update PHI nodes for a guard of the LOOP.

   Input:
   - LOOP, GUARD_EDGE: LOOP is a loop for which we added guard code that
        controls whether LOOP is to be executed.  GUARD_EDGE is the edge that
        originates from the guard-bb, skips LOOP and reaches the (unique) exit
        bb of LOOP.  This loop-exit-bb is an empty bb with one successor.
        We denote this bb NEW_MERGE_BB because before the guard code was added
        it had a single predecessor (the LOOP header), and now it became a merge
        point of two paths - the path that ends with the LOOP exit-edge, and
        the path that ends with GUARD_EDGE.
   - NEW_EXIT_BB: New basic block that is added by this function between LOOP
        and NEW_MERGE_BB. It is used to place loop-closed-ssa-form exit-phis.

   ===> The CFG before the guard-code was added:
        LOOP_header_bb:
          loop_body
          if (exit_loop) goto update_bb
          else           goto LOOP_header_bb
        update_bb:

   ==> The CFG after the guard-code was added:
        guard_bb:
          if (LOOP_guard_condition) goto new_merge_bb
          else                      goto LOOP_header_bb
        LOOP_header_bb:
          loop_body
          if (exit_loop_condition) goto new_merge_bb
          else                     goto LOOP_header_bb
        new_merge_bb:
          goto update_bb
        update_bb:

   ==> The CFG after this function:
        guard_bb:
          if (LOOP_guard_condition) goto new_merge_bb
          else                      goto LOOP_header_bb
        LOOP_header_bb:
          loop_body
          if (exit_loop_condition) goto new_exit_bb
          else                     goto LOOP_header_bb
        new_exit_bb:
        new_merge_bb:
          goto update_bb
        update_bb:

   This function:
   1. creates and updates the relevant phi nodes to account for the new
      incoming edge (GUARD_EDGE) into NEW_MERGE_BB. This involves:
      1.1. Create phi nodes at NEW_MERGE_BB.
      1.2. Update the phi nodes at the successor of NEW_MERGE_BB (denoted
           UPDATE_BB).  UPDATE_BB was the exit-bb of LOOP before NEW_MERGE_BB
   2. preserves loop-closed-ssa-form by creating the required phi nodes
      at the exit of LOOP (i.e, in NEW_EXIT_BB).

   There are two flavors to this function:

   slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard1:
     Here the guard controls whether we enter or skip LOOP, where LOOP is a
     prolog_loop (loop1 below), and the new phis created in NEW_MERGE_BB are
     for variables that have phis in the loop header.

   slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard2:
     Here the guard controls whether we enter or skip LOOP, where LOOP is an
     epilog_loop (loop2 below), and the new phis created in NEW_MERGE_BB are
     for variables that have phis in the loop exit.

   I.E., the overall structure is:

        loop1_preheader_bb:
                guard1 (goto loop1/merg1_bb)
        loop1
        loop1_exit_bb:
                guard2 (goto merge1_bb/merge2_bb)
        merge1_bb
        loop2
        loop2_exit_bb
        merge2_bb
        next_bb

   slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard1 takes care of creating phis in
   loop1_exit_bb and merge1_bb. These are entry phis (phis for the vars
   that have phis in loop1->header).

   slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard2 takes care of creating phis in
   loop2_exit_bb and merge2_bb. These are exit phis (phis for the vars
   that have phis in next_bb). It also adds some of these phis to
   loop1_exit_bb.

   slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard1 is always called before
   slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard2. They are both needed in order
   to create correct data-flow and loop-closed-ssa-form.

   Generally slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard1 creates phis for variables
   that change between iterations of a loop (and therefore have a phi-node
   at the loop entry), whereas slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard2 creates
   phis for variables that are used out of the loop (and therefore have 
   loop-closed exit phis). Some variables may be both updated between 
   iterations and used after the loop. This is why in loop1_exit_bb we
   may need both entry_phis (created by slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard1)
   and exit phis (created by slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard2).

   - IS_NEW_LOOP: if IS_NEW_LOOP is true, then LOOP is a newly created copy of
     an original loop. i.e., we have:

           orig_loop
           guard_bb (goto LOOP/new_merge)
           new_loop <-- LOOP
           new_exit
           new_merge
           next_bb

     If IS_NEW_LOOP is false, then LOOP is an original loop, in which case we
     have:

           new_loop
           guard_bb (goto LOOP/new_merge)
           orig_loop <-- LOOP
           new_exit
           new_merge
           next_bb

     The SSA names defined in the original loop have a current
     reaching definition that that records the corresponding new
     ssa-name used in the new duplicated loop copy.
  */

/* Function slpeel_update_phi_nodes_for_guard1
   
   Input:
   - GUARD_EDGE, LOOP, IS_NEW_LOOP, NEW_EXIT_BB - as explained above.
   - DEFS - a bitmap of ssa names to mark new names for which we recorded
            information. 
   
   In the context of the overall structure, we have:

        merge1_bb
        loop2
        loop2_exit_bb
        merge2_bb
        next_bb

   For each name updated between loop iterations (i.e - for each name that has
   an entry (loop-header) phi in LOOP) we create a new phi in:

/* Function slpeel_tree_peel_loop_to_edge.

   Peel the first (last) iterations of LOOP into a new prolog (epilog) loop
   that is placed on the entry (exit) edge E of LOOP. After this transformation
   we have two loops one after the other - first-loop iterates FIRST_NITERS
   times, and second-loop iterates the remainder NITERS - FIRST_NITERS times.

   Input:
   - LOOP: the loop to be peeled.
   - E: the exit or entry edge of LOOP.
        If it is the entry edge, we peel the first iterations of LOOP. In this
        case first-loop is LOOP, and second-loop is the newly created loop.
        If it is the exit edge, we peel the last iterations of LOOP. In this
        case, first-loop is the newly created loop, and second-loop is LOOP.
   - NITERS: the number of iterations that LOOP iterates.
   - FIRST_NITERS: the number of iterations that the first-loop should iterate.
   - UPDATE_FIRST_LOOP_COUNT:  specified whether this function is responsible
        for updating the loop bound of the first-loop to FIRST_NITERS.  If it
        is false, the caller of this function may want to take care of this
        (this can be useful if we don't want new stmts added to first-loop).

   Output:
   The function returns a pointer to the new loop-copy, or NULL if it failed
   to perform the transformation.

   The function generates two if-then-else guards: one before the first loop,
   and the other before the second loop:
   The first guard is:
     if (FIRST_NITERS == 0) then skip the first loop,
     and go directly to the second loop.
   The second guard is:
     if (FIRST_NITERS == NITERS) then skip the second loop.

   FORNOW only simple loops are supported (see slpeel_can_duplicate_loop_p).
