	(build_opfncall): Likewise.
	* lex.c (init_lex): Set up values of ansi_opname and opname_tab for
	vec new/delete.  vec new uses "__vn", and vec delete uses "__vd".
	* init.c (init_init_processing): Set up BIVN and BIVD.
	(do_friend): Don't clean up after mistaken setting of TREE_GETS_NEW,
	since it doesn't happen any more.
	(build_new): Support vec new.  Always call something.
	(build_x_delete): Support vec delete.
	(build_vec_delete): Lose dtor_dummy argument, add use_global_delete,
	and pass it to build_x_delete.
	* decl2.c (delete_sanity): Don't change behavior by whether or not
	the type has a destructor.  Pass use_global_delete to
	build_vec_delete.

	new/delete.
	(grokdeclarator): Also force vec new/delete to be static.

	TYPE_VEC_DELETE_TAKES_SIZE.
	* cp-tree.h (TYPE_GETS_{REG,VEC}_DELETE): New macros to simplify
	checking for one delete or the other.
	(lang_type): gets_new and gets_delete are now two bits long.  The
	low bit is for the non-array version.  Lose gets_placed_new.
	(TYPE_VEC_DELETE_TAKES_SIZE): New macro indicating that the vec
	delete defined by this class wants to know how much space it is
	deleting.
	(TYPE_VEC_NEW_USES_COOKIE): New macro to indicate when vec new must
	add a header containing the number of elements in the vector; i.e.
	when the elements need to be destroyed or vec delete wants to know
	the size.
	* class.c (finish_struct_methods): Also check for overloading vec
	delete.
	* call.c (build_method_call): Also delete second argument for vec
	delete.

	* decl.c (grokdeclarator): Correct complaints again.
	(grokdeclarator): Fix segfault on null declarator.
	(decls_match): Also accept redeclaration with no arguments if both
	declarations were in C context.  Bash TREE_TYPE (newdecl) here.
	(duplicate_decls): Instead of here.

	* parse.y (nested_name_specifier_1): Lose rules for dealing with
	syntax errors nicely, since they break parsing of 'const i;'.

	* decl.c (lookup_name): if (got_scope == current_class_type)
	val = IDENTIFIER_CLASS_VALUE (name).

	* search.c (lookup_nested_tag): Look in enclosing classes, too.

	* spew.c (yylex): Only look one character ahead when checking for a
	SCOPE.

	* lex.c (check_newline): Read first nonwhite char before
	incrementing lineno.

	* decl.c (grokdeclarator): Don't claim that typedefs are variables
	in warning.

	* parse.y: Divide up uses of unqualified_id into
	notype_unqualified_id and unqualified_id, so that TYPENAME can be
	used as an identifier after an object.

	* class.c (push_nested_class): Don't push into non-class scope.

	* decl.c (grokdeclarator): If an identifier could be a type
	conversion operator, but has no associated type, it's not a type
	conversion operator.

	* pt.c (unify): Check for equality of constants better.

	* decl.c (grokdeclarator): Don't complain about access decls.

Sun Apr 10 02:39:55 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* decl.c (grokdeclarator): pedwarn about data definitions without
	types here.

	* parse.y (datadef): Don't pedwarn about decls without types here,
	since that is valid for functions.
	(fn.def2, component_decl): Support constructors with declmods again.
	(nomods_initdecls): For decls without any mods, so that we don't try
	to get declspecs from some arbitrary $0.

	* search.c (lookup_field): Use cp_error.

	* parse.y (nested_name_specifier_1): Don't check aggr/non-aggr type
	here; it breaks destructors for non-aggr types.

	* decl.c (lookup_name): Only look for TYPE_DECLs in base classes of
	a type being defined, like the comment says.
	If got_scope is not an aggregate, just return NULL_TREE.

	* pt.c (create_nested_upt): Kung's code for creating types nested
	within uninstantiated templates now lives here (it used to live in
	hack_more_ids).  It needs to be expanded.

	* parse.y: Stop calling see_typename so much.

	* decl.c (lookup_name): Deal with TTPs and UPTs.

	* lex.c (real_yylex): Don't set looking_for_typename just because we
	saw a 'new'.
	(dont_see_typename): #if 0 out.

	* spew.c (yylex): Increment looking_for_typename if the next
	character is SCOPE, rather than setting it to 1; this way, the value
	from seeing an aggr specifier will not be lost.  This kinda relies
	on looking_for_typename never being < 0, which is now true.

	* parse.y (nested_name_specifier_1): Accept TEMPLATE_TYPE_PARMs,
	too.
	(named_class_head_sans_basetype): Accept template types, too.  Oops.

Fri Apr  8 16:39:35 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* decl2.c (reparse_decl_as_expr1): Handle SCOPE_REFs.

	* parse.y: Lose START_DECLARATOR.

	* search.c (lookup_nested_tag): New function to scan CLASSTYPE_TAGS
	for a class.

	A::foo' syntax.  Catch invalid scopes better.

	* parse.y, lex.c: Lose TYPENAME_COLON.

	* decl2.c (groktypefield): #if 0 out.

	* decl.c (lookup_name): If the type denoted by got_scope is
	currently being defined, look in CLASSTYPE_TAGS rather than FIELDS.

	* class.c (push_nested_class): Don't try to push into
	error_mark_node.

Fri Apr  8 07:26:36 1994  Brendan Kehoe  <brendan@lisa.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (stamp-parse): Update count of conflicts to 33.

Thu Apr  7 17:47:53 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	A saner implementation of nested types that treats template types
	no differently from non-template types.  There are still some
	shortcomings of our system; most notably, it is difficult to look
	for a nested type that is hidden by another name, because of the way
	we keep track of hidden types.  But this shouldn't be a problem for
	just about anyone.  Perhaps lookup_field should be fixed up a bit.

	* spew.c: Moved handling of nested types/scoping from the lexer
	into the parser.  Removed variable template_type_seen_before_scope.
	Removed functions frob_identifier, hack_more_ids, and various cruft
	that was #if 0'd out in the past, reducing the size of the file from
	1146 lines to 450 lines.  We can't quite do away with spew.c yet,
	though; we still need it for do_aggr () and checking for SCOPE after
	the current identifier.  And setting lastiddecl.

	* parse.y: Moved handling of nested types/scoping from the lexer
	into the parser, using a new global variable `got_scope'.  Reduced
	the number of states by 53.  Implemented all uses of explicit global
	scope.  Removed terminals SCOPED_TYPENAME and SCOPED_NAME.  Removed
	nonterminals tmpl.1, scoped_base_class, id_scope, typename_scope,
	scoped_typename.  Added nonterminals nested_type,
	qualified_type_name, complete_type_name, qualified_id, ptr_to_mem,
	nested_name_specifier, global_scope, overqualified_id, type_name.
	Changed many others.  Added 9 new reduce/reduce conflicts, which are
	nested type parallels of 9 that were already in the grammar for
	non-nested types.  Eight of the now 33 conflicts should be removed
	in the process of resolving the late binding between variable and
	function decls.

	* gxxint.texi (Parser): Update.

	* cp-tree.h (IS_AGGR_TYPE_CODE): Add UNINSTANTIATED_P_TYPE.

	* lex.h: Add decl for got_scope.

	* lex.c (see_typename): Claim to be the lexer when calling
	lookup_name.

	* decl.c (lookup_name): When called from the lexer, look at
	got_scope and looking_at_typename; otherwise don't.

Thu Apr  7 22:05:47 1994  Mike Stump  <mrs@cygnus.com>

	31th Cygnus<->FSF merge.

	entries in the vtable addressable.
	(finish_decl_parsing): Handle SCOPE_REFs.

	Handle the special case of C function redecl here.
	(duplicate_decls): Only keep the old type if the new decl takes no
	arguments.

	* typeck.c (compparms): Also allow t1 to be ... if strict == 0.

	17:48:41.

Wed Apr  6 16:05:10 1994  Per Bothner  <bothner@kalessin.cygnus.com>

	* init.c (build_virtual_init), search.c (build_vbase_vtables_init),
	ch-tree.h:  Every place these functions were called, the result was
	immediately passed to expand_expr_stmt.  Reduce redundancy by
	calling expand_expr_init *inside* these functions.  These
	makes for a simpler interface, and we don't have to build
	compound expressions.  Hence, rename these function to:
	expand_virtual_init and expand_vbase_vtables_init respectively.
	* init.c, decl.c:  Change callers of these functions.
	* init.c, cp-tree.h (expand_virtual_init):  Make static.

	* decl2.c (finish_file): Check TREE_PUBLIC||TREE_ADDRESSABLE
	rather than DECL_SAVED_INSNS before emitting inlines.

	* spew.c (init_spew): #if 0 out stuff used by arbitrate_lookup.

	* decl.c (duplicate_decls): If this is a new declaration of an
	extern "C" function, keep the type (for the argtypes).
	(redeclaration_error_message): Don't check DECL_LANGUAGE here.
	(decls_match): Call compparms with a value of strict dependent on
	the value of strict_prototypes for DECL_LANGUAGE (oldecl).

	* typeck.c (compparms): ... is only equivalent to non-promoting
	parms if we're not being strict.

	* parse.y (empty_parms): Don't check flag_ansi || pedantic here.

	* decl.c (init_decl_processing): if (flag_ansi || pedantic)
	strict_prototypes_lang_c = strict_prototypes_lang_cplusplus;

	* decl2.c (grok_function_init): Don't set DECL_INITIAL on pure
	virtuals.

	* class.c (build_vfn_ref):  If using thunks, don't need
	to add delta field from vtable (there is none!).
	* decl.c: Add memptr_type as well as vtable_entry_type.
	If using thunks, the latter is just ptr_type_node.
	* gc.c, typeck.c:  Use memptr_typeChange, not vtable_entry_type.
	* decl2.c (finish_vtable_vardecl):  Handle thunks.
	* expr.c (cplus_expand_expr):  Support THUNK_DECL.

	* decl.c (grokdeclarator):  Set DECL_THIS_EXTERN if "extern".

	Improve intelligence about when to emit inlines.
	* cp-tree.h (lang_decl_flags):  New field saved_inline.

	* class.c (add_virtual_function):  Don't set TREE_ADDRESSABLE.

	and set CLASSTYPE_INTERFACE_ONLY if there is a non-inline virtual.

	also handle the ones needed for vtbales.
	* decl2.c (write_vtable_entries, finish_vtable_typedecl):  Removed.

	* cp-tree.h, class.c, decl2.c, search.c:  Remove -fvtable-hack
	and flag_vtable_hack.  Use -fvtable-thunks and flag_vtable_thunks
	instead.  (The rationale is that these optimizations both break binary
	compatibility, but should become the default in a future release.)

Wed Apr  6 10:53:56 1994  Mike Stump  <mrs@cygnus.com>

	* class.c (modify_vtable_entries): Never reset the DECL_CONTEXT
	of a fndecl, as we might not be from that vfield.

	* class.c (add_virtual_function): Fix bug for pure virtual, so
	that DECL_VINDEX of the dummy decl copied won't be error.
	(see also Apr 4 change)

Tue Apr  5 17:23:45 1994  Per Bothner  <bothner@kalessin.cygnus.com>

	* typeck.c (c_expand_return):  Before checking that we're not
	returning the address of a local, make sure it's a VAR_DECL.

Fri Apr  1 17:14:42 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* call.c (build_method_call): When looking at global functions,
	be sure to use instance_ptr for the first argument, not some version

	comparing candidates.

	Cures calling a more base base class function, when a more derived
	base class member should be called in some MI situations.

	* search.c (make_binfo): Use more the more specialized base

	Major revamp of pointer to member functions.  Cures major
	nonfunctionality when used in casts, and MI situations.

	* cvt.c (convert_force): Update call site of build_ptrmemfunc.
	* typeck.c (convert_for_assignment): Likewise.
	* typeck2.c (digest_init): Likewise.
	* typeck2.c (process_init_constructor): Simplify by moving code into
	digest_init.
	* typeck2.c (digest_init): Do default_conversions on init value, if
	we are processing pointer to member functions.
	* class.c (get_vfield_offset): Now non-static.  Convert bit offset
	into byte offset.
	* cp-tree.h (get_vfield_offset): Likewise.
	* typeck.c (get_member_function_from_ptrfunc): Convert down to right
	instance, before fetching vtable pointer.
	* typeck.c (get_delta_difference): New routine.
	* typeck.c (build_ptrmemfunc): Revamp to handle casting better, also
	get vtable pointer out of right subobject.

Tue Mar 22 17:56:48 1994  Mike Stump  <mrs@cygnus.com>

	* search.c (get_binfo): Return NULL instead of aborting, when
	passed a UNION_TYPE.

Tue Mar 22 12:44:54 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	These patches implement handling of redefinition/redeclaration of
	templates.

	* typeck.c (comptypes): Simplify.  All TEMPLATE_TYPE_PARMs are
	considered compatible.

	* parse.y (template_def): Pass defn argument to end_template_decl.

	* pt.c (end_template_decl): Add defn argument.  Check for
	redefinition.  Simplify.

	* error.c (OB_UNPUT): New macro, to remove mistakes.
	(aggr_variety): Subroutine of dump_aggr_type.

	* decl.c (decls_match): Support templates.
	(duplicate_decls): No longer static.  Don't try to lay out template
	decls.
	(pushdecl): Simplify.

	* cp-tree.h (DECL_TEMPLATE_MEMBERS): Use DECL_SIZE instead of
	DECL_INITIAL.

Mon Mar 21 11:46:55 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* error.c (dump_decl): Support class template decls.
	(dump_type): Don't adorn template type parms.

	redefinition of templates.

Mon Mar 21 19:36:06 1994  Per Bothner  <bothner@kalessin.cygnus.com>

	* decl.c (grokdeclarator):  Set TREE_PUBLIC for METHOD_TYPE
	in FIELD context, when appropriate.  Also,
	CLASSTYPE_INTERFACE_ONLY is irrelevant to setting TREE_PUBLIC.
	Also, simplify check for bogus return specifiers.

Mon Mar 21 11:46:55 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* parse.y (after_type_declarator1): Expand type_quals.
	(notype_declarator1): Likewise.
	(absdcl1): Likewise.

Sat Mar 19 01:05:17 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* decl.c (grokdeclarator): Treat class-local typedefs like static
	members; i.e. 'typedef int f();' means that f is a function type,
	not a method type.

	* parse.y (decl): Change direct_* back to *.
	(type_id): Change direct_abstract_declarator to absdcl.
	(direct_declarator, direct_initdecls, direct_initdcl0): Remove again.

	(push_to_top_level): Save them.
	(pop_from_top_level): Restore them.

	* gxxint.texi (Parser): Update.

	These two patches finish moving the task of expr/declarator
	ambiguity resolution from the lexer to the parser, and add one more
	r/r conflict.  START_DECLARATOR can now be nuked.

	* parse.y (decl): Add "direct_" in typespec X rules.
	(direct_declarator): New nonterminal for
	direct_after_type_declarator and direct_notype_declarator.
	(direct_initdecls): Like initdecls, but uses direct_initdcl0.

	(named_parm): Add typespec direct_declarator rule.

	* spew.c (yylex): #if 0 out START_DECLARATOR insertion.

	These two patches disable some excessive cleverness on the part of
	g++; a non-class declaration always hides a class declaration in the
	same scope, and g++ was trying to unhide it depending on the
	enclosing expression.

	* spew.c (arbitrate_lookup): #if 0 out.

	* decl.c (lookup_name): Never call arbitrate_lookup.

	* parse.y (complex_notype_declarator1): Add '*'

	those tokens.
	(notype_unqualified_id): Add '~' see_typename IDENTIFIER rule.

Thu Mar 17 17:30:01 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	These changes fix the compiler's handling of the functional cast/
	object declaration ambiguities in section 6.8 of the ARM.  They also
	add 11 reduce/reduce conflicts.  Sigh.

	* parse.y: Add precedence decls for OPERATOR and '~'.
	(notype_unqualified_id): New nonterminal, encompasses all of the
	ANSI unqualified-id nonterminal except TYPENAMEs.
	(expr_or_declarator): New nonterminal to delay parsing of code like
	`int (*a)'.
	(primary): Use notype_unqualified_id.
	(decl): Add typespec initdecls ';' and typespec declarator ';'
	rules.
	(initdcl0): Deal with the above.
	(complex_notype_declarator1): A notype_declarator that is not also
	an expr_or_declarator.
	(complex_direct_notype_declarator): A direct_notype_declarator that
	doesn't conflict with expr_or_declarator.  Use
	notype_unqualified_id.  Remove id_scope see_typename TYPENAME rule.
	(functional_cast): New nonterminal, for the three functional cast
	rules.  So that they can be moved after
	complex_direct_notype_declarator.
	(see_typename): Don't accept type_quals any more.

	* decl2.c (reparse_decl_as_expr): New function to deal with parse
	nodes for code like `int (*a)++;'.
	(reparse_decl_as_expr1): Recursive subroutine of the above.
	(finish_decl_parsing): New function to deal with parse nodes for
	code like `int (*a);'.  See the difference?

Thu Mar 17 12:16:10 1994  Mike Stump  <mrs@cygnus.com>

	These changes break binary compatibility in code with classes
	that use virtual bases.

	* search.c (dfs_get_vbase_types): Simplify and correct to make
	sure virtual bases are initialized in dfs ordering.
	* search.c (get_vbase_types): Simplify and make readable.

Thu Mar 17 12:01:10 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* parse.y: s/ typename / type_id /g

Wed Mar 16 17:42:52 1994  Kung Hsu  <kung@mexican.cygnus.com>

	* parse.y (typespec): Add SCOPE TYPENAME for global scoped
	type. e.g. ::B x.

	* decl.c (complete_array_type): Fix a bug that in -pendantic
	mode even there's no initializer, it will continue to build
	default index.

Wed Mar 16 17:43:07 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* parse.y (direct_notype_declarator): Add PTYPENAME rule, remove
	all of the scoped PTYPENAME rules.

Wed Mar 16 16:39:02 1994  Mike Stump  <mrs@cygnus.com>

	* init.c (build_offset_ref): The value of A::typedef_name is
	always the TYPE_DECL, and never an error.

Tue Mar 15 20:02:35 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* search.c (get_base_distance_recursive): Two binfos can only
	represent the same object if they are both via_virtual.

	* class.c (finish_base_struct): Check vbases for ambiguity, too.

	* search.c (get_vbase_types): Accept binfo argument, too.

Tue Mar 15 19:22:05 1994  Kung Hsu  <kung@mexican.cygnus.com>

	* decl.c (complete_array_type): Complete TYPE_DOMAIN of the
	initializer also, because back-end requires it.

Tue Mar 15 15:33:31 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* error.c (dump_expr): Support member functions (which show up as
	OFFSET_REFs).

Mon Mar 14 16:24:36 1994  Mike Stump  <mrs@cygnus.com>

	* init.c (build_new): Set the return type of multidimensional
	news correctly.

	(complex_parmlist): Parmlists that are not also typenames.
	(parms_comma): Enabler.
	(named_parm): A parm that is not also a typename.  Use declarator
	rather than dont_see_typename abs_or_notype_decl.  Expand
	typed_declspecs inline.
	(abs_or_notype_decl): Lose.
	(dont_see_typename): Comment out.
	(bad_parm): Break out abs_or_notype_decl into two rules.

	* decl2.c (reparse_decl_as_expr): Recursive function to change
	parse nodes for `A()()' from "function returning function returning
	A" to "A().operator()".

	`typespec fcast_or_absdcl' rule.
	(fcast_or_absdcl): New nonterminal to implement late reduction of

Fri Mar  4 13:24:33 1994  Mike Stump  <mrs@cygnus.com>

	* typeck.c (convert_arguments): Handle setHandler(A::handlerFn)
	so that it is like setHandler(&A::handlerFn).  Cures an `invalid
	lvalue in unary `&''.

	* gxxint.texi (Copying Objects): New section discussing default
	op= problems with virtual inheritance.

	* decl2.c (grokoptypename): Just does grokdeclarator and
	build_typename_overload, since the parser can't call grokdeclarator
	directly.

	* method.c (build_typename_overload): Set IDENTIFIER_GLOBAL_VALUE
	and TREE_TYPE on generated identifiers.

	* error.c (dump_decl): Say sorry rather than my_friendly_aborting
	if we can't figure out what to do.
	(dump_type*): Likewise.

	* typeck2.c (build_m_component_ref): 'component' is an expr, not
	a decl.  Also move the IS_AGGR_TYPE check after the stripping of
	REFERENCE_TYPE.

Fri Mar  4 04:46:05 1994  Mike Stump  <mrs@cygnus.com>

	* call.c (build_method_call): Handle b->setHandler(A::handlerFn)
	so that it is like b->setHandler(&A::handlerFn).  Cures an `invalid
	lvalue in unary `&''.

Thu Mar  3 12:38:15 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* parse.y: Add precedence specification for START_DECLARATOR.

	beginning of the list.  The typed_declspecs rule will deal with this
	omission.
	(declmods): Accept nonempty_type_quals, rather than TYPE_QUAL
	directly.

	* parse.y (direct_notype_declarator,
	direct_after_type_declarator, direct_abstract_declarator): Split up
	the declarator1 nonterminals to match the draft standard and avoid
	ambiguities.
	(new_type_id, new_declarator, direct_new_declarator,
	new_member_declarator): New nonterminals to implement the subset of

	(list_hash_lookup_or_cons): Likewise.

	* parse.y (typed_declspecs, declmods): It's not necessary to hash
	the declspecs on class_obstack, so don't.  This way typed_typespecs
	can reduce to typed_declspecs.

Wed Mar  2 14:29:18 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@cygnus.com>

	* cvt.c (build_up_reference): If we aren't checking visibility,
	also allow base->derived conversions.

	* parse.y (component_decl): Don't include "typed_declspecs
	declarator ';'" speedup, since it breaks enums.

Fri Feb 25 15:43:44 1994  Per Bothner  <bothner@kalessin.cygnus.com>

	* class.c (finish_struct):  Minor optimization for building
	fn_fields list.

Fri Feb 25 15:23:42 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* decl.c (start_function): Fix detection of function overloading.

Thu Feb 24 22:26:19 1994  Mike Stump  <mrs@cygnus.com>

	* lex.c (check_newline): #pragma interface can take a string
	argument, just like #pragma implementation.  #pragma implementation
	checks for garbage on the line, line #pragma interface does.  Main

	* Makefile.in (stamp-parse): Update expected conflict count.

	* parse.y (various): Replace "declmods declarator" with "declmods
	notype_declarator".  The comment saying that "declmods declarator ';'"
	corresponds to "int i;" was wrong; it corresponds to "const i;".
	(component_decl): Add "typed_declspecs declarator ';'" rule; this
	*does* correspond to "int i;".  Change "declmods components" to
	"declmods notype_components".
	(components): Don't deal with a list of one anymore.
	(notype_components): New nonterminal, corresponds to notype_declarator.
	({after_,no}type_component_decl{,0}): More new nonterminals.

	nonterminal so that we can stick %prec EMPTY on it.

	Add more %prec EMPTY's to eliminate remaining shift/reduce
	conflicts.

	(after_type_declarator): Add maybe_raises to fndecl rules.
	(after_type_declarator_no_typename): Remove.
	For correctness.

	Document remaining reduce/reduce conflicts.

Tue Feb 22 12:10:32 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* parse.y: Eliminate 20 shift/reduce conflicts.

Fri Feb 18 11:49:42 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* pt.c (type_unification): Add subr argument; if set, it means
	that we are calling ourselves recursively, so a partial match is OK.
	(unify): Support pointers to methods and functions.
	(tsubst): Support method pointers.
	* decl.c (build_ptrmemfunc_type): No longer static, so that
	tsubst can get at it.

	* init.c (is_aggr_typedef): Pretend template type parms are
	aggregates.
	* decl2.c (build_push_scope): If cname refers to a template type

	type_unification.
	* pt.c (do_function_instantiation): Likewise.
	* class.c (instantiate_type): Likewise.

	* search.c (get_base_distance): If BINFO is a binfo, use it and
	don't mess with its BINFO_INHERITANCE_CHAIN.

	* cvt.c (convert_to_reference): Fix temporary generation.
	If ambiguous, return error_mark_node.

	* init.c (build_new): Put back some necessary code.

Thu Feb 17 15:39:47 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* init.c (build_new): Deal with array types properly.

	* search.c (get_binfo): Become a shell for get_base_distance.
	(get_binfo_recursive): Lose.
	(get_base_distance_recursive): Find the path to the via_virtual base
	that provides the most access.
	(get_base_distance): Likewise.

	* parse.y (explicit_instantiation): Syntax is 'template class
	A<int>', not 'template A<int>'.

	* typeck.c (convert_for_initialization): Remove bogus warning.

	* parse.y (datadef): Revert patch of Oct 27.

Thu Feb 17 15:12:29 1994  Per Bothner  <bothner@kalessin.cygnus.com>

	* class.c (build_vfn_ref):  Cast delta field to ptrdiff_type_node,

	* decl.c (build_ptrmemfunc_type): Make sure that the pmf type
	goes onto the same obstack as its target type.

Wed Feb 16 00:34:46 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* cvt.c (convert_to_reference): If converting via constructor
	on local level, go back to build_cplus_new approach.

	* tree.c (build_cplus_new): If with_cleanup_p, set cleanup slot
	to error_mark_node to prevent expand_expr from building a cleanup
	for this variable.

	* lex.c (default_assign_ref_body): Return *this from the memcpy
	version, too.

	* decl.c (grok_reference_init): Just return if called with
	error_mark_node, don't worry about initializing non-const reference
	with temporary.

	* cvt.c (convert_to_reference): Do the right thing for
	non-aggregate reference conversions, pedwarn when generating a
	non-const reference to a temporary.

	* class.c (finish_struct): TYPE_HAS_COMPLEX_{INIT,ASSIGN}_REF and
	TYPE_NEEDS_CONSTRUCTING all depend on TYPE_USES_VIRTUAL_BASECLASSES
	again.

Tue Feb 15 19:47:19 1994  Jason Merrill  <jason@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* decl.c (grok_reference_init): Pawn off a lot of the work on
	convert_to_reference.  Generally do the right thing.

	* cvt.c (convert_to_reference): Conform to the initial comment;
	i.e. don't create temps if decl != error_mark_node.  Handle
	cleanups better for temps that do get created.  Don't pretend
	that we can use an 'A' to initialize a 'const double &' just by
