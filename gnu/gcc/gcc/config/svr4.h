/* Provide an ASM_SPEC appropriate for svr4.  Here we try to support as
   many of the specialized svr4 assembler options as seems reasonable,
   given that there are certain options which we can't (or shouldn't)
   support directly due to the fact that they conflict with other options
   for other svr4 tools (e.g. ld) or with other options for GCC itself.
   For example, we don't support the -o (output file) or -R (remove
   input file) options because GCC already handles these things.  We
   also don't support the -m (run m4) option for the assembler because
   that conflicts with the -m (produce load map) option of the svr4
   linker.  We do however allow passing arbitrary options to the svr4
   assembler via the -Wa, option.

   Note that gcc doesn't allow a space to follow -Y in a -Ym,* or -Yd,*
   option.

   The svr4 assembler wants '-' on the command line if it's expected to
   read its stdin.

   allow us to link things in one of these three modes by applying the
   appropriate combinations of options at link-time.  We also provide
   support here for as many of the other svr4 linker options as seems
   reasonable, given that some of them conflict with options for other
   svr4 tools (e.g. the assembler).  In particular, we do support the
   -z*, -V, -b, -t, -Qy, -Qn, and -YP* options here, and the -e*, -l*,
   -o*, -r, -s, -u*, and -L* options are directly supported by gcc.c
   itself.  We don't directly support the -m (generate load map)
   option because that conflicts with the -m (run m4) option of the
   svr4 assembler.  We also don't directly support the svr4 linker's
   -I* or -M* options because these conflict with existing GCC
   options.  We do however allow passing arbitrary options to the svr4
   linker via the -Wl, option, in gcc.c.  We don't support the svr4
   linker's -a option at all because it is totally useless and because
   it conflicts with GCC's own -a option.

   Note that gcc doesn't allow a space to follow -Y in a -YP,* option.
