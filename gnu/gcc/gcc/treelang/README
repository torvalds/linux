This is a sample language front end for GCC.

This is a replacement for 'toy' which had potential copyright issues,
but more importantly it did not exercise very much of GCC. The intent
of this language is that it should provide a cookbook of language
elements that you can use in any language front end.

To this end, treelang is essentially an implementation of a subset of 
the GCC back end 'tree' interface in syntax.

Thanks to Richard Kenner, Joachim Nadler and many others for helping
me to understand enough of GCC to do this.

Please note, the documentation is not a good model to use for GCC
front end documentation.
