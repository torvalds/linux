- _GLIBCPP_HAS_BUILTIN_SINF: We should still hold out for a cleaner solution the is currenly the case in bits/std_cmath.h. 

- there may be one set of remaining string bugs, dependent on final
clarification of the string::find technicalities when finding in an
empty string or using an empty string for an argument. At the very
least, v-3 has interpreted the standard in a way that is in opposition
to other libraries on other platforms.

- trigraphs and keywords a la the iso646 header are not correctly
implemented. It looks like the compiler recognizes them as keywords
but then doesn't translate into the correct bit ops. It is a mystery.

- wide strings have not been tested, and may therefore be unusable.

- Chapter 27 io functionality is not finished. As such, there are
known bugs in: filebuf::putbackfail

- Many facet implementations are stubs. (22) 

- Almost no optimizations for small-footprint/low-overhead. (22,27) 

- There has been some work to wrap the C headers in namespace std::, but 
   it may not be complete yet, and C macros are not shadowed. Please consult 
   the mailing list archives for more information.
