This directory contains software that is Gigantic and Nasty but
Unavoidable.

Some, but not all, of the software in this subtree follows special
rules, i.e.  licences other than BSD.

So:
- check the history of external code before importing it.
- for GPL software be ready to arrange for copyright papers somewhat
in advance if you want to work on it (the FSF takes a few months to
process these).

Otherwise, changes might not make it to the main distribution, and may
need some further maintenance over time, or risk getting lost.

Some internal changes are acceptable, but OpenBSD can't afford to maintain
a complete separate toolchain on its own.
