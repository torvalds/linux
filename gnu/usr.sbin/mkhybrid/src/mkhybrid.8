.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mkhybrid
is effectively a pre-mastering program to generate an HFS/ISO9660/JOLIET hybrid
filesystem. It is based on
.BR mkisofs (1)
and will generate a pure ISO9660 filesystem unless the HFS hybrid command
line options are given.
.PP
.B mkhybrid
can generate a 
.I true
(or
.IR shared)
HFS hybrid filesystem. The same files are seen as HFS files when
accessed from a Macintosh and as ISO9660 files when accessed from other 
machines. HFS stands for
.I Hierarchical File System
and is the native file system used on Macintosh computers.
.PP
As an alternative,
.B mkhybrid
can generate the
.I Apple Extensions to ISO9660
for each file. These extensions provide each file with CREATOR, TYPE and
certain Finder Flags when accessed from a Macintosh. See the
.B MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
section below.
.PP
.B mkhybrid
takes a snapshot of a given directory tree, and generates a
binary image which will correspond to an ISO9660 or HFS filesystem when
written to a block device.
.PP
.B mkhybrid
is also capable of generating the System Use Sharing Protocol records specified
by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol.  This is used to further describe the
files in the iso9660 filesystem to a unix host, and provides information such
as longer filenames, uid/gid, posix permissions, and block and character
devices.
.PP
Each file written to the iso9660 filesystem must have a filename in the 8.3
format (8 characters, period, 3 characters, all upper case), even if Rock Ridge
is in use.  This filename is used on systems that are not able to make use of
the Rock Ridge extensions (such as MS-DOS), and each filename in each directory
must be different from the other filenames in the same directory.
.B mkhybrid
generally tries to form correct names by forcing the unix filename to upper
case and truncating as required, but often times this yields unsatisfactory
results when there are cases where the
truncated names are not all unique.
.B mkhybrid
assigns weightings to each filename, and if two names that are otherwise the
same are found the name with the lower priority is renamed to have a 3 digit
number as an extension (where the number is guaranteed to be unique).  An
example of this would be the files foo.bar and
foo.bar.~1~ - the file foo.bar.~1~ would be written as FOO.000;1 and the file
foo.bar would be written as FOO.BAR;1
.PP
When used with the HFS options,
.B mkhybrid
will attempt to recognise files stored in a number of Apple/Unix file formats
and will copy the data and resource forks as well as any
relevant finder information. See the
.B MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
section below for more about formats
.B mkhybrid
supports.
.PP
Note that
.B mkhybrid
is not designed to communicate with the writer directly.  Most writers
have proprietary command sets which vary from one manufacturer to
another, and you need a specialized tool to actually burn the disk.
The
.B cdwrite
utility is one such tool that runs under Linux and performs this task.
The latest version of
.B cdwrite
is capable of communicating with Phillips/IMS/Kodak, HP and Yamaha drives.
Most writers come with some version of DOS software that allows a direct image
copy of an iso9660 image to the writer.
.\"The current version of
.\".B cdwrite
.\"is available from ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/utils/disk-management/cdwrite-2.0.tar.gz
Note that cdwrite has not been actively maintained in recent times.
.PP
The
.B
cdrecord
utility is another utility capable of burning an actual disc.  The latest version
of
.\".B cdrecord
.\"is available
.\"from ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord
Cdrecord is under constant development.
.PP
Also you should know that most cd writers are very particular about timing.
Once you start to burn a disc, you cannot let their buffer empty before you
are done, or you will end up with a corrupt disc.  Thus it is critical
that you be able to maintain an uninterrupted data stream to the writer
for the entire time that the disc is being written.
.PP
.br
.I
pathspec
is the path of the directory tree to be copied into the iso9660 filesystem.
Multiple paths can be specified, and
.B
mkhybrid
will merge the files found in all of the specified path components to form the cdrom
image.
.PP
It is possible to graft the paths at points other than the root
directory, and it is possible to graft files or directories onto the
cdrom image with names different than what they have in the source filesystem.  This is
easiest to illustrate with a couple of examples.   Let's start by assuming that a local
file ../old.lis exists, and you wish to include it in the cdrom image.


	foo/bar/=../old.lis

will include the file old.lis in the cdrom image at /foo/bar/old.lis, while

	foo/bar/xxx=../old.lis

will include the file old.lis in the cdrom image at /foo/bar/xxx.  The
same sort of syntax can be used with directories as well.
.B
mkhybrid
will create any directories required such that the graft
points exist on the cdrom image - the directories do not need to
appear in one of the paths.  Any directories that are created on the
fly like this will have permissions 0555 and appear to be owned by the
person running mkhybrid.  If you wish other permissions or owners of
the intermediate directories, the easiest solution is to create real
directories in the path such that mkhybrid doesn't have to invent them.
.PP
.I
mkhybrid
will also run on Win9X/NT4 machines when compiled with Cygnus' cygwin.
Therefore most
references in this man page to
.I Unix
can be replaced with
.IR Win32 .

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
Include all files on the iso9660 filesystem.  Normally files that contain the
characters '~' or '#' will not be included (these are typically backup files
for editors under unix).
.TP
.BI \-abstract " FILE
Specifies the abstract file name.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.mkisofsrc
with ABST=filename.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.BI \-A " application_id
Specifies a text string that will be written into the volume header.
This should describe the application that will be on the disc.  There
is space on the disc for 128 characters of information.  This parameter can
also be set in the file
.I \&.mkisofsrc
with APPI=id.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.BI \-biblio " FILE
Specifies the bibliographic file name.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.mkisofsrc
with BIBLO=filename.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.BI \-b " boot_image
Specifies the path and filename of the boot image to be used when making
an "El Torito" bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the source
path specified to
.B mkhybrid.
This option is required to make a bootable CD.
The boot image must be exactly the size of one of a 1.2, 1.44, or
2.88 MB floppy, or of a 2 KB CD sector,
and
.B mkhybrid
will use this size when creating the output iso9660 filesystem.
If the boot file is 2 KB long, a no-emulation boot CD will be created,
and the whole 2 KB will be read on boot.
If the boot file is a floppy image,
then only the first 512-byte sector will be read from the boot image
(it is emulating a normal floppy drive).
This will work, for example, if the boot image is a LILO-based boot floppy.
.TP
.BI \-C " last_sess_start,next_sess_start
This option is needed when
.B mkisofs
is used to create the image of a second session or a higher level session
for a multi session disk.
The option
.B \-C
takes a pair of two numbers separated by a comma. The first number is the
sector number of the first sector in the last session of the disk
that should be appended to.
The second number is the starting sector number of the new session.
The expected pair of numbers may be retrieved by calling
.B "cdrecord -msinfo ...
the
.B \-C
option may only be uses in conjunction with the
.B \-M
option.
.TP
.BI \-c " boot_catalog
Specifies the path and filename of the boot catalog to be used when making
an "El Torito" bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the source
path specified to
.B mkhybrid.
This option is required to make a bootable CD.
This file will be created by
.B mkhybrid
in the source filesystem, so be
sure the specified filename does not conflict with an existing file, as
it will be quietly overwritten! Usually a name like "boot.catalog" is
chosen.
.TP
.BI \-copyright " FILE
Specifies the Copyright file name.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.mkisofsrc
with COPY=filename.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.B \-d
Omit trailing period from files that do not have a period.  This violates the
ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.  Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-D
Do not use deep directory relocation, and instead just pack them in the
way we see them.  This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it works on many
systems.  Use with caution.
.TP
.BI \-e " efi_boot_image
Specifies the path and filename of the EFI boot image to be used when making
an "El Torito" bootable CD.
The pathname must be relative to the source path specified to
.B mkhybrid.
The file should contain an EFI system partition image.
The
.B \-e
option can be used with or without the
.B \-b
option.
.TP
.B \-f
Follow symbolic links when generating the filesystem.  When this option is not
in use, symbolic links will be entered using Rock Ridge if enabled, otherwise
the file will be ignored.
.TP
.BI \-hide " glob
Hide
.I glob
from being seen on the ISO9660 or Rock Ridge directory.
.I glob
is a shell wild-card-style pattern that must match any part of the filename 
or path.
Multiple globs may be hidden (up to 1000).
If
.I glob
matches a directory, then the contents of that directory will be hidden.
All the hidden files will still be written to the output CD image file.
Should be used with the
.I \-hide-joliet
option.
.TP
.BI \-hide-list " file
A file containing a list of
.I globs
to be hidden as above.
.TP
.BI \-hide-joliet " glob
Hide
.I glob
from being seen on the Joliet directory.
.I glob
is a shell wild-card-style pattern that must match any part of the filename 
or path.
Multiple globs may be hidden (up to 1000).
If
.I glob
matches a directory, then the contents of that directory will be hidden.
All the hidden files will still be written to the output CD image file.
Should be used with the
.I \-hide
option.
.TP
.BI \-hide-joliet-list " file
A file containing a list of
.I globs
to be hidden as above.
.TP
.B \-l
Allow full 32 character filenames.  Normally the ISO9660 filename will be in an
8.3 format which is compatible with MS-DOS, even though the ISO9660 standard
allows filenames of up to 32 characters.  If you use this option, the disc may
be difficult to use on a MS-DOS system, but this comes in handy on some other
systems (such as the Amiga).  Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-J
Generate Joliet directory records in addition to regular iso9660 file
names.  This is primarily useful when the discs are to be used on Windows-NT
or Windows-95 machines.   The Joliet filenames are specified in Unicode and
each path component can be up to 64 Unicode characters long.
.TP
.B \-L
Allow filenames to begin with a period.  Usually, a leading dot is
replaced with an underscore in order to maintain MS-DOS compatibility.
.TP
.BI \-log-file " log_file
Redirect all error, warning and informational messages to
.I log_file
instead of the standard error.
.TP
.BI \-m " glob
Exclude
.I glob
from being written to CDROM.
.I glob
is a shell wild-card-style pattern that must match part of the filename (not 
the path as with option
.BR -x ).
Technically
.I glob
is matched against the
.I d->d_name
part of the directory entry.
Multiple globs may be excluded (up to 1000).
Example:

mkhybrid \-o rom \-m '*.o' \-m core \-m foobar

would exclude all files ending in ".o", called "core" or "foobar" to be
copied to CDROM. Note that if you had a directory called "foobar" it too (and
of course all its descendants) would be excluded.
.sp
NOTE: The \-m and \-x option description should both be updated, they are wrong.
Both now work identical and use filename globbing. A file is excluded if either
the last component matches or the whole path matches.
.TP
.BI \-exclude-list " file
A file containing a list of
.I globs
to be exclude as above.
.TP
.BI \-M " path
or
.TP
.BI \-M " device
Specifies path to existing iso9660 image to be merged. The alternate form
takes a SCSI device specifier that uses the same syntax as the
.B "dev=
parameter of
.B cdrecord.
The output
of 
.B mkhybrid
will be a new session which should get written to the end of the
image specified in -M.  Typically this requires multi-session capability
for the recorder and cdrom drive that you are attempting to write this
image to.
This option may only be used in conjunction with the
.B \-C
option.
.TP
.B \-N
Omit version numbers from ISO9660 file names.  This may violate the ISO9660
standard, but no one really uses the version numbers anyway.  Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-no-split-symlink-components
Don't split the SL components, but begin a new Continuation Area (CE)
instead. This may waste some space, but the SunOS 4.1.4 cdrom driver
has a bug in reading split SL components (link_size = component_size 
instead of link_size += component_size).
.TP
.B \-no-split-symlink-fields
Don't split the SL fields, but begin a new Continuation Area (CE)
instead. This may waste some space, but the SunOS 4.1.4 and
Solaris 2.5.1 cdrom driver have a bug in reading split SL fields
(a `/' can be dropped).
.TP
.BI \-o " filename
is the name of the file to which the iso9660 filesystem image should be
written.  This can be a disk file, a tape drive, or it can correspond directly
to the device name of the optical disc writer.  If not specified, stdout is
used.  Note that the output can also be a block special device for a regular
disk drive, in which case the disk partition can be mounted and examined to
ensure that the premastering was done correctly.
.TP
.BI \-path-list " file
A file containing a list of
.I filespec
directories and filenames to be added to the ISO9660 filesystem. This list
of filespecs are processed after any that appear on the command line. If the
argument is
.IR - ,
then the list is read from the standard input.
.TP
.BI \-P " publisher_id
Specifies a text string that will be written into the volume header.
This should describe the publisher of the CDROM, usually with a
mailing address and phone number.  There is space on the disc for 128
characters of information.  This parameter can also be set in the file
.I \&.mkisofsrc
with PUBL=.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.BI \-p " preparer_id
Specifies a text string that will be written into the volume header.
This should describe the preparer of the CDROM, usually with a mailing
address and phone number.  There is space on the disc for 128
characters of information.  This parameter can also be set in the file
.I \&.mkisofsrc
with PREP=.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.B \-print-size
Print estimated filesystem size and exit. This option is needed for
Disk At Once mode and with some CD-R drives when piping directly into
.B cdrecord.
In this case it is needed to know the size of the filesystem before the
actual CD-creation is done.
The option \-print-size allows to get this size from a "dry-run" before
the CD is actually written.
.TP
.B \-quiet
This makes
.B mkhybrid
even less verbose.  No progress output will be provided.
.TP
.B \-R
Generate SUSP and RR records using the Rock Ridge protocol to further describe
the files on the iso9660 filesystem.
.TP
.B \-r
This is like the \-R option, but file ownership and modes are set to
more useful values.  The uid and gid are set to zero, because they are
usually only useful on the author's system, and not useful to the
client.  All the file read bits are set true, so that files and
directories are globally readable on the client.  If any execute bit is
set for a file, set all of the execute bits, so that executables are
globally executable on the client.  If any search bit is set for a
directory, set all of the search bits, so that directories are globally
searchable on the client.  All write bits are cleared, because the
CD-Rom will be mounted read-only in any case.  If any of the special
mode bits are set, clear them, because file locks are not useful on a
read-only file system, and set-id bits are not desirable for uid 0 or
gid 0.
When used on Win32, the execute bit is set on
.I all
files.
.TP
.BI \-sysid " ID
Specifies the system ID.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.mkisofsrc
with SYSI=system_id.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.B \-T
Generate a file TRANS.TBL in each directory on the CDROM, which can be used
on non-Rock Ridge capable systems to help establish the correct file names.
There is also information present in the file that indicates the major and
minor numbers for block and character devices, and each symlink has the name of
the link file given.
.TP 
.BI \-table-name " TABLE_NAME
Alternative translation table file name (see above). Implies the
.I \-T
option.
.TP
.BI \-V " volid
Specifies the volume ID (volume name or label) to be written into the
master block.  This parameter can also be set in the file
.I \&.mkisofsrc
with VOLI=id.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.  Note that
if you assign a volume ID, this is the name that will be used as the mount
point used by the Solaris volume management system and the name that is
assigned to the disc on a Windows or Mac platform.
.TP
.BI \-volset " ID
Specifies the volset ID.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.mkisofsrc
with VOLS=volset_id.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.BI \-volset-size " #
Sets the volume set size to #.
The volume set size is the number of CD's that are in a CD set.
The
.B \-volset-size
option may be used to create CD's that are part of e.g. a Operation
System installation set of CD's.
The option
.B \-volset-size
must be specified before
.B \-volset-seqno
on each command line.
.TP
.BI \-volset-seqno " #
Sets the volume set sequence number to #.
The volume set sequence number is the index number of the current
CD in a CD set.
The option
.B \-volset-size
must be specified before
.B \-volset-seqno
on each command line.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose execution. If given twice on the command line, extra debug information will be printed.
.TP
.BI \-x " path
Exclude
.I path
from being written to CDROM.
.I path
must be the complete pathname that results from concatenating the pathname
given as command line argument and the path relative to this directory.
Multiple paths may be excluded (up to 1000).
Example: 

mkhybrid \-o cd \-x /local/dir1 \-x /local/dir2 /local
.sp
NOTE: The \-m and \-x option description should both be updated, they are wrong.
Both now work identical and use filename globbing. A file is excluded if either
the last component matches or the whole path matches.
.TP
.B \-z
Generate special SUSP records for transparently compressed files.  This is
only of use and interest for hosts that support transparent decompression.
This is an experimental feature, and no hosts yet support this, but there
are ALPHA patches for Linux that can make use of this feature.
.SH HFS OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-hfs
Create an ISO9660/HFS hybrid CD. By default, all source files are checked to
attempt to recognise files stored in one of the known Apple/Unix file formats.
See the
.B MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
section below for more about these formats
.TP
.B \-apple
Create an ISO9660 CD with Apple's extensions. Similar to the
.I \-hfs
option, except that the Apple Extensions to ISO9660 are added instead of
creating an HFS hybrid volume.
.TP
.BI \-map " mapping_file
Use the
.I mapping_file
to set the CREATOR and TYPE information for a file based on the
filename's extension. A filename is 
mapped only if it is not one of the know Apple/Unix file formats. See the
.B CREATOR/TYPE
section below.
.TP
.BI \-magic " magic_file
The CREATOR and TYPE information is set by using a file's
.I magic number
(usually the first few bytes of a file). The
.I magic_file
is only used if a file is not one of the known Apple/Unix file formats, or
the filename extension has not been mapped using the
.I \-map
option. See the 
.B CREATOR/TYPE
section below for more details.
.TP
.B \-no-mac-files
Disables searching for Apple/Unix files. This will speed up processing if
there are none of the known Apple/Unix format files in the source directory
trees (the source directories just contain ordinary files). The 
.I \-map
and/or
.I \-magic
option can be used to set the CREATOR and TYPE for each file.
.TP
.B \-probe
Search the contents of files for Apple/Unix file formats. When
.I \-hfs
or
.I \-apple
is used, mkhybrid will attempt to work out automatically what type of
Apple/Unix format each file is. However, the only way to check for
.I MacBinary
and
.I AppleSingle
files is to open and read them. Therefore, if
.I MacBinary
or
.I AppleSingle
format files are being used, then you need to give this option. 
This saves opening and searching every file if no
.I MacBinary
and/or
.I AppleSingle
files exist. Or you could use the relevant 
.I double dash
options given below.
.TP
.B \-no-desktop
Do not create (empty) Desktop files. New HFS Desktop files will be created
when the CD is used on a Macintosh (and stored in the System Folder).
By default, empty Desktop files are added to the HFS volume.
.TP
.B \-mac-name
Use the HFS filename as the starting point for the ISO9660, Joliet and
Rock Ridge file names. See the
.B MACINTOSH FILE NAMES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-boot-hfs-file " driver_file
Installs the
.I driver_file
that
.I may
make the CD bootable on a Macintosh. See the
.B HFS BOOT DRIVER
section below. (Alpha).
.TP
.B \-part
Generate an HFS partition table. By default, no partition table is generated,
but some older Macintosh CDROM drivers need an HFS partition table on the
CDROM to be able to recognize a hybrid CDROM.
.TP
.BI \-auto " AutoStart_file
Make the HFS CD use the QuickTime 2.0 Autostart feature to launch an
application or document. The given filename must be the name of a document or
application located at the top level of the CD. The filename must be less
than 12 characters. (Alpha).
.TP
.BI \-cluster-size " size
Set the size in bytes of the cluster or allocation units of PC Exchange

.BI \-hide-hfs " glob
Hide
.I glob
from the HFS volume. The file or directory will still exist in the
ISO9660 and/or Joliet directory.
.I glob
is a shell wild-card-style pattern that must match any part of the filename
Multiple globs may be excluded (up to 1000).
Example:

mkhybrid \-o rom \-hfs \-hide-hfs '*.o' \-hide-hfs foobar

would exclude all files ending in ".o" or called "foobar" 
from the HFS volume. Note that if you had a directory called
"foobar" it too (and of course all its descendants) would be excluded.
The
.I glob
can also be a path name relative to the source directories given on the
command line. Example:

mkhybrid \-o rom \-hfs \-hide-hfs src/html src

would exclude just the file or directory called "html" from the "src"
directory. Any other file or directory called "html" in the tree will
not be excluded.

.SH CREATOR/TYPE
A Macintosh file has two properties associated with it which define
which application created the file, the
.I CREATOR
and what data the file contains, the
.IR TYPE .
Both are (exactly) 4 letter strings. Usually this
allows a Macintosh user to double-click on a file and launch the correct
application etc. The CREATOR and TYPE of a particular file can be found by
using something like ResEdit (or similar) on a Macintosh.
.LP
The CREATOR and TYPE information is stored in all the various Apple/Unix
encoded files.
For other files it is possible to base the CREATOR and TYPE on the
filename's extension using a
.I mapping
file (the
.I -map
option) and/or using the
.I magic number
(usually a
.I signature
in the first few bytes)
of a file (the
.I -magic
option). If both these options are given, then their order on the command
line is important. If the
.I -map
option is given first, then a filename extension match is attempted
before a magic number match. However, if the
.I -magic
option is given first, then a magic number match is attempted before a
filename extension match.
.PP
If a mapping or magic file is not used, or no match is found then the default
CREATOR and TYPE for all regular files can be set by using entries in the 
.I \&.mkisofsrc
file, otherwise the default CREATOR and TYPE are 'unix' and 'TEXT'.
.PP
The format of the
.I mapping
file is the same
.I afpfile
format as used by
.IR aufs .
This file has five columns for the
.IR extension ,
.I file
.IR translation ,
.IR CREATOR ,
.I TYPE
and
.IR Comment .
Lines starting with the '#' character are
comment lines and are ignored. An example file would be like:
.LP
.TS
tab (/);
l s s s s
l s s s s
l l l l l .
# Example filename mapping file

\&.mov/Raw/'TVOD'/'MooV'/"QuickTime Movie"
*/Ascii/'ttxt'/'TEXT'/"Text file"
.TE
.LP
Where:
.IP
The first column
.I EXTN
defines the Unix filename extension to be
mapped. The default mapping for any filename extension that doesn't
match is defined with the "*" character.
.IP
The
.I Xlate
column defines the type of text translation between the Unix and
Macintosh file it is ignored by
.IR mkhybrid,
but is kept to be compatible with
.IR aufs (1).
Although 
.I mkhybrid
does not alter the contents of a file, if a binary file has it's TYPE
set as 'TEXT', it
.I may
be read incorrectly on a Macintosh. Therefore a better choice for the
default TYPE may be '????'
.IP
The
.I CREATOR
and
.I TYPE
keywords must be 4 characters long and enclosed in single quotes.
.IP
The comment field is enclosed in double quotes - it is ignored by
.IR mkhybrid ,
but is kept to be compatible with 
.IR aufs .
.PP
The format of the
.I magic
file is almost identical to the
.IR magic (4)
file used by the Linux
.IR file (1)
command - the routines for reading and decoding the
.I magic
file are based on the Linux
.IR file (1)
command.
.PP
This file has four tab separated columns for the 
.I byte
.IR offset ,
.IR type ,
.I test
and
.IR message .
Lines starting with the '#' character are
comment lines and are ignored. An example file would be like:
.LP
.TS
tab (/);
l s s s
l s s s
l l l l .
# Example magic file

4/string/moov/txtt MooV  QuickTime movie file (moov)
4/string/mdat/txtt MooV  QuickTime movie file (mdat)
.TE
.PP
The format of the file is described in the
.IR magic (4)
man page. The only difference here is that for each entry in the magic file, the
.I message
for the initial offset
.B must
be 4 characters for the CREATOR followed by 4 characters for the TYPE -
white space is
optional between them. Any other characters on this line are ignored.
Continuation lines (starting with a '>') are also ignored i.e. only the initial
offset lines are used.
.PP
Using the
.I \-magic
option may significantly increase processing time as each file has to opened
and read to find it's magic number.
.PP
In summary, for all files, the default CREATOR is 'unix' and the default
TYPE is 'TEXT'.  These can be changed by using entries in the 
.I \&.mkisofsrc
file.
.PP
If the a file is in one of the known Apple/Unix formats (and the format
has been selected), then the CREATOR and TYPE are taken from the values
stored in the Apple/Unix file.
.PP
Other files can have their CREATOR and TYPE set from their file name
extension (the
.I \-map
option), or their magic number (the
.I \-magic
option). If the default match is used in the
.I mapping
file, then these values override the default CREATOR and TYPE.

.SH MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
Macintosh files have two parts called the
.I Data
and
.I Resource
fork. Either may be empty. Unix (and many other OSs) can only
cope with files having one part (or fork). To add to this, Macintosh files
have a number of attributes associated with them - probably the most
important are the TYPE and CREATOR. Again Unix has no concept of these
types of attributes.
.PP
e.g. a Macintosh file may be a JPEG image where the image is stored in the
Data fork and a desktop thumbnail stored in the Resource fork. It is usually
the information in the data fork that is useful across platforms.
.PP
Therefore to store a Macintosh file on a Unix filesystem, a way has to be
found to cope with the two forks and the extra attributes (which are
referred to as the
.I finder
.IR info).
Unfortunately, it seems that every software package that stores Macintosh
files on Unix has chosen a completely different storage method.
.PP
The Apple/Unix formats that
.I mkhybrid
(partially) supports are:
.IP "CAP AUFS format"
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork in subdirectory .resource
with same filename as data fork. Finder info
in .finderinfo subdirectory with same filename.
.IP "AppleDouble/Netatalk"
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork stored in a file with
same name prefixed with "%". Finder info also stored in same
"%" file. Netatalk uses the same format, but the resource
fork/finderinfo stored in subdirectory .AppleDouble with same
name as data fork.
.IP AppleSingle
Data structures similar to above, except both forks and finder
info are stored in one file.
.IP "Helios EtherShare"
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork and finder info together in
subdirectory .rsrc with same filename as data fork.
.IP "IPT UShare"
Very similar to the EtherShare format, but the finder info
is stored slightly differently.
.IP MacBinary
Both forks and finder info stored in one file.
.IP "Apple PC Exchange"
Used by Macintoshes to store Apple files on DOS (FAT) disks.
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork in subdirectory
resource.frk (or RESOURCE.FRK). Finder info as one record
in file finder.dat (or FINDER.DAT). Separate finder.dat for
each data fork directory.
.IP
Note: normally files should be accessed directly from the DOS media as
.I mkhybrid
needs to find out the native FAT cluster size.
If the native FAT cluster size is known, then the 
.I -cluster-size
option can be used to set the cluster size - useful if PC Exchange files have
be copied from DOS disks before running
.IR mkhybrid .
The cluster or allocation size can be found by using the DOS utility
.IR CHKDSK .
.IP
May not work with PC Exchange v2.2 or higher files (available with MacOS 8.1).
DOS media containing PC Exchange files should be mounted as type
.B msdos
(not
.BR vfat )
when using Linux.
.IP "SGI/XINET"
Used by SGI machines when they mount HFS disks. Data fork stored
in a file. Resource fork in subdirectory .HSResource with same
name. Finder info as one record in file .HSancillary. Separate .HSancillary
for each data fork directory.
.LP
.I mkhybrid
will attempt to set the CREATOR, TYPE, date and possibly other flags from
the finder info. Additionally, if it exists, the Macintosh filename is set
from the finder info, otherwise the Macintosh name is based on the Unix
filename - see the MACINTOSH FILE NAMES section below.
.PP
When using the
.I \-apple
option, the TYPE and CREATOR are stored in the optional System Use or SUSP field
in the ISO9660 Directory Record - in much the same way as the Rock Ridge
attributes are. In fact to make life easy, the Apple extensions are added
at the beginning of the existing Rock Ridge attributes (i.e. to get the Apple
extensions you get the Rock Ridge extensions as well).
.PP
The Apple extensions require the resource fork to be stored as an ISO9660
.I associated
file. This is just like any normal file stored in the ISO9660 filesystem
except that the associated file flag is set in the Directory Record (bit
2). This file has the same name as the data fork (the file seen by
non-Apple machines). Associated files are normally ignored by other OSs
.PP
When using the
.I \-hfs
option, the TYPE and CREATOR plus other finder info, are stored in a separate
HFS directory, not visible on the ISO9660 volume. The HFS directory references
the same data and resource fork files described above.
.PP
In most cases, it is better to use the
.I \-hfs
option instead of the
.I \-apple
option, as the latter imposes the limited ISO9660 characters allowed in
filenames. However, the Apple extensions do give the advantage that the
files are packed on the disk more efficiently and it may be possible to fit 
more files on a CD - important when the total size of the source files is
approaching 650MB.



.SH MACINTOSH FILE NAMES
Where possible, the HFS filename that is stored with an Apple/Unix file
is used for the HFS part of the CD. However, not all the Apple/Unix
encodings store the HFS filename with the finderinfo. In these cases,
the Unix filename is used - with escaped special characters. Special
characters include '/' and characters with codes over 127.
.PP
Aufs escapes these characters by using ":" followed by the character code
as two hex digits. Netatalk and EtherShare have a similar scheme, but uses
"%" instead of a ":".
.PP
If mkhybrid can't find an HFS filename, then it uses the Unix name, with
any %xx or :xx characters (xx == two hex digits) converted to a single
character code. If "xx" are not hex digits ([0-9a-fA-F]), then they are
left alone - although any remaining ":" is converted to "%" as colon
is the HFS directory separator. Care must be taken, as an ordinary Unix
file with %xx or :xx will also be converted. e.g.
.PP
.TS
l l 
l s
l l
l s
l l .
This:2fFile	converted to This/File
	
This:File	converted to This%File
	
This:t7File	converted to This%t7File
.TE
.PP
Although HFS filenames appear to support upper and lower case letters,
the filesystem is case insensitive. i.e. the filenames "aBc" and "AbC"
are the same. If a file is found in a directory with the same HFS name,
then
.I mkhybrid
will attempt, where possible, to make a unique name by adding '_' characters
to one of the filenames. 
.PP
If an HFS filename exists for a file, then mkhybrid can use this name as
the starting point for the ISO9660, Joliet and Rock Ridge filenames using
the
.I \-mac-name
option. Normal Unix files without an HFS name will still use their Unix name.
e.g.
.PP
If a
.I MacBinary
(or
.I PC
.IR Exchange )
file is stored as 
.I someimage.gif.bin
on the Unix filesystem, but contains a HFS file called
.IR someimage.gif ,
then this is the name that would appear on the HFS part of the CD. However, as
mkhybrid uses the Unix name as the starting point for the other names, then
the ISO9660 name generated will probably be 
.I SOMEIMAG.BIN
and the Joliet/Rock Ridge would be
.IR someimage.gif.bin .
Although the actual data (in this case) is a GIF image. This option will use
the HFS filename as the starting point and the ISO9660 name will probably be
.I SOMEIMAG.GIF
and the Joliet/Rock Ridge would be
.IR someimage.gif .
.PP
Using the
.I \-mac-name
option will not currently work with the
.I \-T
option - the Unix
name will be used in the TRANS.TBL file, not the Macintosh name.
.PP
The existing mkisofs code will filter out any illegal characters for the
ISO9660 and Joliet filenames, but as mkisofs expects to be dealing
directly with Unix names, it leaves the Rock Ridge names as is.
But as '/' is a legal HFS filename character, the
.I -mac-name
option coverts '/' to a '_' in a Rock Ridge filenames.
.PP
If the Apple extensions are used, then only the ISO9660 filenames will
appear on the Macintosh. However, as the Macintosh ISO9660 drivers can use
.I Level 2
filenames, then you can use the
.I \-l
option without problems on
a Macintosh - still take care over the names, for example
.I this.file.name
will be converted to
.I THIS.FILE
i.e. only have one '.', also filename
.I abcdefgh
will be seen as
.I ABCDEFGH
but
.I abcdefghi
will be seen as
.I ABCDEFGHI.
i.e. with a '.' at the end - don't know if this is a Macintosh
problem or mkisofs/mkhybrid problem. All filenames will be in uppercase
when viewed on a Macintosh. Of course, DOS/Win3.X machines will not be able
to see Level 2 filenames...
.PP
As Macintosh filenames do use the '~' and '#' characters (especially when
using PC Exchange Macintosh files), then the
.I \-a
option should be given.

.SH HFS BOOT DRIVER
It 
.I may
be possible to make the hybrid CD bootable on a Macintosh.
.PP
A bootable HFS CD requires an Apple CD-ROM (or compatible) driver, a bootable
HFS partition and the necessary System, Finder, etc. files.
.PP
A driver can be obtained from any other Macintosh bootable CD-ROM using the
.I apple_driver
utility. This file can then be used with the
.I \-boot-hfs-file
option.
.PP
The HFS partition (i.e. the hybrid disk in our case) must contain a
suitable System Folder, again from another CD-ROM or disk.
.PP
For a partition to be bootable, it must have it's 
.I boot block
set. The boot
block is in the first two blocks of a partition. For a non-bootable partition
the boot block is full of zeros. Normally, when a System file is copied to
partition on a Macintosh disk, the boot block is filled with a number of
required settings - unfortunately I don't know the full spec for the boot
block, so I'm guessing that the following will work OK.
.PP
Therefore, the utility
.I apple_driver
also extracts the boot block from the
first HFS partition it finds on the given CD-ROM and this is used for the
HFS partition created by
.IR mkhybrid .
.IP "PLEASE NOTE"

you become liable to obey Apple Computer, Inc. Software License Agreements.

.SH BUGS
Any files that have hard links to files not in the tree being copied to the
iso9660 filesystem will have an incorrect file reference count.
.PP
There may be some other ones.  Please, report them to the author.

.SH HFS PROBLEMS/LIMITATIONS
I have had to make several assumptions on how I expect the modified
libhfs routines to work, however there may be situations that either
I haven't thought of, or come across when these assumptions fail.
Therefore I can't guarantee that mkhybrid will work as expected
(although I haven't had a major problem yet). Most of the HFS features work
fine, however, some are not fully tested. These are marked as
.I Alpha
above.
.PP
Output volume size must be at least 800Kb (libhfs limit - shouldn't
really be a problem).
.PP
Although HFS filenames appear to support upper and lower case letters,
the filesystem is case insensitive. i.e. the filenames "aBc" and "AbC"
are the same. If a file is found in a directory with the same HFS name, then
.I mkhybrid
will attempt, where possible, to make a unique name by adding '_' characters
to one of the filenames.
.PP
HFS file/directory names that share the first 31 characters have
_N' (N == decimal number) substituted for the last few characters
to generate unique names.
.PP
Care must be taken when "grafting" Apple/Unix files or directories (see
above for the method and syntax involved). It is not possible to use a
new name for an Apple/Unix encoded file/directory. e.g. If a Apple/Unix
encoded file called "oldname" is to added to the CD, then you can not use
the command line:
.IP
mkhybrid -o output.raw -hfs newname=oldname cd_dir
.LP
mkhybrid will be unable to decode "oldname". However, you can graft
Apple/Unix encoded files or directories as long as you do not attempt to
give them new names as above.
.PP
The
.I -M
option has no real meaning with an HFS volume - and will probably not work.
.PP
Symbolic links (as with all other non-regular files) are not added to
the HFS directory.
.PP
Hybrid volumes may be larger than pure ISO9660 volumes
containing the same data.
.PP
The resulting hybrid volume can be accessed on a Unix machine by using
the hfsutils routines. However, no changes should be made to the
contents of the volume as it's not a "real" HFS volume.
.PP
Using the
.I \-mac-name
option will not currently work with the
.I \-T
option - the Unix
name will be used in the TRANS.TBL file, not the Macintosh name.
.PP
Although 
.I mkhybrid
does not alter the contents of a file, if a binary file has it's TYPE
set as 'TEXT', it
.I may
be read incorrectly on a Macintosh. Therefore a better choice for the
default TYPE may be '????'
.PP
The
.I \-mac-boot-file
option may not work at all...
.PP
The
.I \-a
option should be used at all times. It may well become the default in future
releases.
.PP
May not work with PC Exchange v2.2 or higher files (available with MacOS 8.1).
DOS media containing PC Exchange files should be mounted as type
