.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mkisofs
is effectively a pre-mastering program to generate the iso9660 filesystem - it
takes a snapshot of a given directory tree, and generates a binary image which
will correspond to an iso9660 filesystem when written to a block device.
.PP
.B mkisofs
is also capable of generating the System Use Sharing Protocol records specified
by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol.  This is used to further describe the
files in the iso9660 filesystem to a unix host, and provides information such
as longer filenames, uid/gid, posix permissions, and block and character
devices.
.PP
Each file written to the iso9660 filesystem must have a filename in the 8.3
format (8 characters, period, 3 characters, all upper case), even if Rock Ridge
is in use.  This filename is used on systems that are not able to make use of
the Rock Ridge extensions (such as MS-DOS), and each filename in each directory
must be different from the other filenames in the same directory.
.B mkisofs
generally tries to form correct names by forcing the unix filename to upper
case and truncating as required, but often times this yields unsatisfactory
results when there are cases where the
truncated names are not all unique.
.B mkisofs
assigns weightings to each filename, and if two names that are otherwise the
same are found the name with the lower priority is renamed to have a 3 digit
number as an extension (where the number is guaranteed to be unique).  An
example of this would be the files foo.bar and
foo.bar.~1~ - the file foo.bar.~1~ would be written as FOO.000;1 and the file
foo.bar would be written as FOO.BAR;1
.PP
Note that
.B mkisofs
is not designed to communicate with the writer directly.  Most writers
have proprietary command sets which vary from one manufacturer to
another, and you need a specialized tool to actually burn the disk.
The
.B cdwrite
utility is one such tool that runs under Linux and performs this task.
The latest version of
.B cdwrite
is capable of communicating with the Phillips/IMS/Kodak, HP and Yamaha drives
that have been manufactured before 1997.
Most writers come with some version of DOS software that allows a direct image
copy of an iso9660 image to the writer.  The current version of
.B cdwrite
is available from sunsite.unc.edu: /utils/disk-management/cdwrite-2.0.tar.gz
Note that cdwrite has not been actively maintained since 1995.
.PP
The
.B
cdrecord
utility is another utility capable of burning an actual disc.  The latest version
of
.B cdrecord
is available from
ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord
Cdrecord is under constant development.
.PP
Also you should know that most cd writers are very particular about timing.
Once you start to burn a disc, you cannot let their buffer empty before you
are done, or you will end up with a corrupt disc.  Thus it is critical
that you be able to maintain an uninterrupted data stream to the writer
for the entire time that the disc is being written.
.PP
.br
.B path
is the path of the directory tree to be copied into the iso9660 filesystem.
Multiple paths can be specified, and
.B
mkisofs
will merge the files found in all of the specified path components to form the cdrom
image.
.PP
It is possible to graft the paths at points other than the root
directory, and it is possible to graft files or directories onto the
cdrom image with names different than what they have in the source filesystem.  This is
easiest to illustrate with a couple of examples.   Let's start by assuming that a local
file ../old.lis exists, and you wish to include it in the cdrom image.


	foo/bar/=../old.lis

will include the file old.lis in the cdrom image at /foo/bar/old.lis, while

	foo/bar/xxx=../old.lis

will include the file old.lis in the cdrom image at /foo/bar/xxx.  The
same sort of syntax can be used with directories as well.
.B
mkisofs will create any directories required such that the graft
points exist on the cdrom image - the directories do not need to
appear in one of the paths.  Any directories that are created on the
fly like this will have permissions 0555 and appear to be owned by the
person running mkisofs.  If you wish other permissions or owners of
the intermediate directories, the easiest solution is to create real
directories in the path such that mkisofs doesn't have to invent them.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
Include all files on the iso9660 filesystem.  Normally files that contain the
characters '~' or '#' will not be included (these are typically backup files
for editors under unix).
.TP
.BI \-abstract " FILE
Specifies the abstract file name.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.mkisofsrc
with ABST=filename.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.BI \-A " application_id
Specifies a text string that will be written into the volume header.
This should describe the application that will be on the disc.  There
is space on the disc for 128 characters of information.  This parameter can
also be set in the file
.B \&.mkisofsrc
with APPI=id.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.BI \-biblio " FILE
Specifies the bibliographic file name.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.mkisofsrc
with BIBLO=filename.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.BI \-b " boot_image
Specifies the path and filename of the boot image to be used when making
an "El Torito" bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the source
path specified to
.B mkisofs.
This option is required to make a bootable CD.
The boot image must be exactly the size of either a 1.2, 1.44, or a 2.88
meg floppy, and
.B mkisofs
will use this size when creating the output iso9660
filesystem. It is assumed that the first 512 byte sector should be read
from the boot image (it is essentially emulating a normal floppy drive).
This will work, for example, if the boot image is a LILO based boot floppy.
.TP
.BI \-C " last_sess_start,next_sess_start
This option is needed when 
.B mkisofs 
is used to create the image of a second session or a higher level session
for a multi session disk.
The option 
.B \-C
takes a pair of two numbers separated by a comma. The first number is the
sector number of the first sector in the last session of the disk
that should be appended to.
The second number is the starting sector number of the new session.
The expected pair of numbers may be retrieved by calling
.B "cdrecord -msinfo ...
the 
.B \-C
option may only be uses in conjunction with the 
.B \-M
option.
.TP
.BI \-c " boot_catalog
Specifies the path and filename of the boot catalog to be used when making
an "El Torito" bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the source
path specified to
.B mkisofs.
This option is required to make a bootable CD.
This file will be created by
.B mkisofs
in the source filesystem, so be
sure the specified filename does not conflict with an existing file, as
it will be quietly overwritten! Usually a name like "boot.catalog" is
chosen.
.TP
.BI \-copyright " FILE
Specifies the Copyright file name.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.mkisofsrc
with COPY=filename.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.B \-d
Omit trailing period from files that do not have a period.  This violates the
ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.  Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-D
Do not use deep directory relocation, and instead just pack them in the
way we see them.  This violates the ISO9660 standard, but it works on many
systems.  Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-f
Follow symbolic links when generating the filesystem.  When this option is not
in use, symbolic links will be entered using Rock Ridge if enabled, otherwise
the file will be ignored.
.TP
.BI \-hide " glob
Hide
.I glob
from being seen on the ISO9660 or Rock Ridge directory.
.I glob
is a shell wild-card-style pattern that must match any part of the filename 
or path.
Multiple globs may be hidden (up to 1000).
If
.I glob
matches a directory, then the contents of that directory will be hidden.
All the hidden files will still be written to the output CD image file.
Should be used with the
.B \-hide-joliet
option.
.TP
.BI \-hide-joliet " glob
Hide
.I glob
from being seen on the Joliet directory.
.I glob
is a shell wild-card-style pattern that must match any part of the filename 
or path.
Multiple globs may be hidden (up to 1000).
If
.I glob
matches a directory, then the contents of that directory will be hidden.
All the hidden files will still be written to the output CD image file.
Should be used with the
.B \-hide
option.
.TP
.B \-l
Allow full 32 character filenames.  Normally the ISO9660 filename will be in an
8.3 format which is compatible with MS-DOS, even though the ISO9660 standard
allows filenames of up to 32 characters.  If you use this option, the disc may
be difficult to use on a MS-DOS system, but this comes in handy on some other
systems (such as the Amiga).  Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-J
Generate Joliet directory records in addition to regular iso9660 file
names.  This is primarily useful when the discs are to be used on Windows-NT
or Windows-95 machines.   The Joliet filenames are specified in Unicode and
each path component can be up to 64 Unicode characters long.
.TP
.B \-L
Allow filenames to begin with a period.  Usually, a leading dot is
replaced with an underscore in order to maintain MS-DOS compatibility.
.TP
.BI \-log-file " log_file
Redirect all error, warning and informational messages to
.I log_file
instead of the standard error.
.TP
.BI \-m " glob
Exclude
.I glob
from being written to CDROM.
.I glob
is a shell wild-card-style pattern that must match part of the filename (not 
the path as with option
.BR -x ).
Technically
.I glob
is matched against the
.I d->d_name
part of the directory entry.
Multiple globs may be excluded (up to 1000).
Example:

mkisofs \-o rom \-m '*.o' \-m core \-m foobar

would exclude all files ending in ".o", called "core" or "foobar" to be
copied to CDROM. Note that if you had a directory called "foobar" it too (and
of course all its descendants) would be excluded.
.sp
NOTE: The \-m and \-x option description should both be updated, they are wrong.
Both now work identical and use filename globbing. A file is exluded if either
the last component matches or the whole path matches.
.TP
.BI \-M " path 
or
.TP
.BI \-M " device
Specifies path to existing iso9660 image to be merged. The alternate form
takes a SCSI device specifier that uses the same syntax as the 
.B "dev=
parameter of 
.B cdrecord.
The output of 
.B mkisofs
will be a new session which should get written to the end of the
image specified in -M.  Typically this requires multi-session capability
for the recorder and cdrom drive that you are attempting to write this
image to.
This option may only be used in conjunction with the 
.B \-C
option.
.TP
.B \-N
Omit version numbers from ISO9660 file names.  This may violate the ISO9660
standard, but no one really uses the version numbers anyway.  Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-no-split-symlink-components
Don't split the SL components, but begin a new Continuation Area (CE)
instead. This may waste some space, but the SunOS 4.1.4 cdrom driver
has a bug in reading split SL components (link_size = component_size 
instead of link_size += component_size).
.TP
.B \-no-split-symlink-fields
Don't split the SL fields, but begin a new Continuation Area (CE)
instead. This may waste some space, but the SunOS 4.1.4 and
Solaris 2.5.1 cdrom driver have a bug in reading split SL fields
(a `/' can be dropped).
.TP
.BI \-o " filename
is the name of the file to which the iso9660 filesystem image should be
written.  This can be a disk file, a tape drive, or it can correspond directly
to the device name of the optical disc writer.  If not specified, stdout is
used.  Note that the output can also be a block special device for a regular
disk drive, in which case the disk partition can be mounted and examined to
ensure that the premastering was done correctly.
.TP
.BI \-P " publisher_id
Specifies a text string that will be written into the volume header.
This should describe the publisher of the CDROM, usually with a
mailing address and phone number.  There is space on the disc for 128
characters of information.  This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.mkisofsrc
with PUBL=.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.BI \-p " preparer_id
Specifies a text string that will be written into the volume header.
This should describe the preparer of the CDROM, usually with a mailing
address and phone number.  There is space on the disc for 128
characters of information.  This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.mkisofsrc
with PREP=.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.B \-print-size
Print estimated filesystem size and exit. This option is needed for
Disk At Once mode and with some CD-R drives when piping directly into
.B cdrecord.
In this case it is needed to know the size of the filesustem before the
actual CD-creation is done.
The option \-print-size allows to get this size from a "dry-run" before
the CD is actually written.
.TP
.B \-R
Generate SUSP and RR records using the Rock Ridge protocol to further describe
the files on the iso9660 filesystem.
.TP
.B \-r
This is like the \-R option, but file ownership and modes are set to
more useful values.  The uid and gid are set to zero, because they are
usually only useful on the author's system, and not useful to the
client.  All the file read bits are set true, so that files and
directories are globally readable on the client.  If any execute bit is
set for a file, set all of the execute bits, so that executables are
globally executable on the client.  If any search bit is set for a
directory, set all of the search bits, so that directories are globally
searchable on the client.  All write bits are cleared, because the
CD-Rom will be mounted read-only in any case.  If any of the special
mode bits are set, clear them, because file locks are not useful on a
read-only file system, and set-id bits are not desirable for uid 0 or
gid 0.
.TP
.BI \-sysid " ID
Specifies the system ID.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.mkisofsrc
with SYSI=system_id.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.B \-T
Generate a file TRANS.TBL in each directory on the CDROM, which can be used
on non-Rock Ridge capable systems to help establish the correct file names.
There is also information present in the file that indicates the major and
minor numbers for block and character devices, and each symlink has the name of
the link file given.
.TP
.BI \-V " volid 
Specifies the volume ID to be written into the master block.  This
parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.mkisofsrc
with VOLI=id.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.  Note that 
if you assign a volume ID, this is the name that will be used as the mount  
point used by the Solaris volume management system and the name that is
assigned to the disc on a Windows or Mac platform. 
.TP
.BI \-volset " ID
Specifies the volset ID.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.mkisofsrc
with VOLS=volset_id.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.BI \-volset-size " #
Sets the volume set size to #. 
The volume set size is the number of CD's that are in a CD set.
The 
.B \-volset-size
option may be used to create CD's that are part of e.g. a Operation
System installation set of CD's.
The option 
.B \-volset-size
must be specified before
.B \-volset-seqno
on each command line.
.TP
.BI \-volset-seqno " #
Sets the volume set sequence number to #. 
The volume set sequence number is the index number of the current
CD in a CD set.
The option 
.B \-volset-size
must be specified before
.B \-volset-seqno
on each command line.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose execution.
.TP
.BI \-x " path
Exclude
.I path
from being written to CDROM.
.I path
must be the complete pathname that results from concatenating the pathname
given as command line argument and the path relative to this directory.
Multiple paths may be excluded (up to 1000).
Example: 

mkisofs \-o cd \-x /local/dir1 \-x /local/dir2 /local
.sp
NOTE: The \-m and \-x option description should both be updated, they are wrong.
Both now work identical and use filename globbing. A file is exluded if either
the last component matches or the whole path matches.
.TP
.B \-z
Generate special SUSP records for transparently compressed files.  This is
only of use and interest for hosts that support transparent decompression.
This is an experimental feature, and no hosts yet support this, but there
are ALPHA patches for Linux that can make use of this feature.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.B mkisofs
looks for the
.B \&.mkisofsrc
file,
first in the current working directory,
then in the user's home directory,
and then in the directory in which the
.B mkisofs
binary is stored.  This file is assumed to contain a series of lines
of the form 
.BI TAG= value,
and in this way you can specify certain options.
The case of the tag is not significant.
Some fields in the volume header
are not settable on the command line, but can be altered through this
facility.
Comments may be placed in this file,
using lines which start with a hash (#) character.
.TP
.B APPI
The application identifier
should describe the application that will be on the disc.
There is space on the disc for 128 characters of information.
May be overridden using the 
.B \-A 
command line option.
.TP
.B COPY
The copyright information,
often the name of a file on the disc containing the copyright notice.
There is space in the disc for 37 characters of information.
May be overridden using the 
.B \-copyright
command line option.
.TP
.B ABST
The abstract information,
often the name of a file on the disc containing an abstract.
There is space in the disc for 37 characters of information.
May be overridden using the 
.B \-abstract
command line option.
.TP
.B BIBL
The bibliographic information,
often the name of a file on the disc containing a bibliography.
There is space in the disc for 37 characters of information.
May be overridden using the 
.B \-bilio
command line option.
.TP
.B PREP
This should describe the preparer of the CDROM,
usually with a mailing address and phone number.
There is space on the disc for 128 characters of information.
May be overridden using the 
.B \-p 
command line option.
.TP
.B PUBL
This should describe the publisher of the CDROM,
usually with a mailing address and phone number.
There is space on the disc for 128 characters of information.
May be overridden using the 
.B \-P 
command line option.
.TP
.B SYSI
The System Identifier.
There is space on the disc for 32 characters of information.
May be overridden using the 
.B \-sysid
command line option.
.TP
.B VOLI
The Volume Identifier.
There is space on the disc for 32 characters of information.
May be overridden using the 
.B \-V 
command line option.
.TP
.B VOLS
The Volume Set Name.
There is space on the disc for 128 characters of information.
May be overridden using the 
.B \-volset
command line option.
.PP
.B mkisofs
can also be configured at compile time with defaults for many of these fields.
See the file defaults.h.
.SH AUTHOR
.B mkisofs
is not based on the standard mk*fs tools for unix, because we must generate
a complete  copy of an existing filesystem on a disk in the  iso9660
filesystem.  The name mkisofs is probably a bit of a misnomer, since it
not only creates the filesystem, but it also populates it as well.
