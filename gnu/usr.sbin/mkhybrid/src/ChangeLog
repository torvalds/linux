Wed Nov  5 10:46:29 1997  Andreas Buschmann US/EC4 60/1F/110 #40409  <buschman@lts.sel.alcatel.de>

	Circumvent a bug in the SunOS / Solaris CD-ROM driver (and maybe HP/UX, too).
       
       * mkisofs.8 (-S): Document switch.
       *  mkisofs.c (split_SL_field): new Variable, new switch -S.
       *  mkisofs.h (split_SL_field): new Variable.
       * rock.c (generate_rock_ridge_attributes): only split SL field,
       when split_SL_field is set.

       * mkisofs.8 (-s): Document switch.
       * mkisofs.c (split_SL_component): new Variable, new switch -s.
       * mkisofs.h (split_SL_component): new Variable.
       * rock.c (generate_rock_ridge_attributes): only split SL
       components, when split_SL_component is set.
       
       * defaults.h: Added SunOS string.
       

Wed Mar 19 16:50:17 1997  Fred Fish  <fnf@ninemoons.com>

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Let configure set basic flags.  Move
	compilation option -c to actual CC commands.
	(LDFLAGS): Let configure set basic flags.
	(Makefile): Depends upon config.status, not configure.
	Regenerate if necessary from Makefile.in using config.status.
	(configure): Cd to srcdir before running autoconf.
	* acconfig.h: New file to hold nonstandard entries used in
	config.h.in.  Used by autoheader to generate config.h.in.
	* config.h.in: Regenerated with autoheader.
	* configure.in: Check for existance of sbrk() function.
	* configure: Regenerated with autoconf 2.12.
	* fnmatch.c (FMN_FILE_NAME): Define if not already defined.
	(FNM_LEADING_DIR): Ditto.
	(FNM_CASEFOLD): Ditto.
	* mkisofs.c (main): Only use sbrk() if system supports it.

Fri Mar 14 21:54:37 1997  Eric Youngdale  <eric@andante.jic.com>

	* Bump version number to 1.10, public release.

	* Put entire thing under RCS.  History is buried there now.

	* Fix bug involving empty directories, translation tables and
	malloc(0).

Mon Feb 17 12:44:03 1997  Eric Youngdale  <eric@andante.jic.com>

	* Bump version number to 1.10b7.

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, config.in: Change to use GNU autoconf.

	* Configure: Delete old configuration script.

	* tree.c: Fix bug where we had a rename limit of 1000 files
	instead of 0x1000.

	* mkisofs.c: Fix sign of timezone offset.  Linux iso filesystem
	also need to be fixed, unfortunately.
	
Tue Dec  3 22:21:21 1996  Eric Youngdale  <eric@sub2317.jic.com>

	Fixed a couple of multi-session bugs.  Discs now seem to
	work on both Solaris and Windows-NT.

	* Bump version number to 1.10b6.

Tue Dec  3 22:21:21 1996  Eric Youngdale  <eric@sub2317.jic.com>

	Multi-session stuff *almost* there.  Discs seem to work
	under Linux without any problem, but under DOS only
	the first session is seen.  The patch to write.c
	inspired by disc written by Windows generated multi-session
	disc, which will hopefully make the discs usable under
	DOS as well.
	
	* Bump version number to 1.10b5.

	* write.c: use size of new session, not total of all sessions
	in volume_space_size field.

	* mkisofs.8: Update with current location of cdwrite.

Mon Nov  4 23:45:01 1996  Eric Youngdale  <eric@sub2317.jic.com>

	* Bump version number to 1.10b4.

	* Add cdwrite.c.diff file, which provides a very crude, minimal
	interface between mkisofs and cdwrite.  It should be enough to
	generate a multi-session disc, but it hasn't been tested yet.

Thu Oct 17 00:39:52 1996  Eric Youngdale  <eric@sub2317.jic.com>

	* Bump version number to 1.10b3.

Wed Oct 16 23:40:44 1996  Michael Fulbright <msf@redhat.com>

	Add support for 'El Torito' specification which allows for bootable
	cdroms.

	* Makefile.in: Add eltorito.[c,o].

	* defaults.h: Add default settings for El Torito related things.

	* iso9660.h: Add structure definitions for El Torito.

	* mkisofs.8: Document new options.

	* mkisofs.c: Add support for new options related to El Torito.

	* mkisofs.h: Add definitions, prototypes as required.

	* tree.c: Add search_tree_file function to search for a specified
	file.

	* write.c: Add support for writing special records for El Torito.

	* eltorito.c: New file.

	
Wed Oct 16 23:40:44 1996  Eric Youngdale  <eric@sub2317.jic.com>

	* rock.c: Fix bug whereby we made assumptions about how
	dev_t was split into major/minor.  Use major() and minor()
	macros to do this for us, since each system should
	do this correctly.

	* write.c: Fix bug whereby abstract, copyright and appid
	strings were not properly filled if application ID weren't
	in use.

Sun Sep 29 10:05:10 1996  Eric Youngdale  <eric@sub2317.jic.com>

	* Bump version number to 1.10b2.  Minor bug fixes here
	and there.

Sun Sep 15 18:54:05 1996  Eric Youngdale  <eric@sub2317.jic.com>

	* Bump version number to 1.10b1.  Major new functionality is
	support for multi-session.  Still a bit preliminary, but
	most of the pieces are there now.

Wed Dec 20 16:44:44 1995  Eric Youngdale  (eric@andante.aib.com)

        * mkisofs.c, mkisofs.8, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 1.05.

	* rock.c: Bugfix for cases where sizeof(int) == 4 and
	sizeof(dev_t) > 4.

	* rock.c: Bugfix for long symbolic links ('/' characters were
	being dropped).

	Patches from Peter Miller <pmiller@agso.gov.au>:

	* mkisofs.8: Documentation fix (some versions of nroff don't
	like '.' in column 1 if it is not a nroff command).

	* mkisofs.c: Add support for 'rationalize' option.
	Similar to rock ridge, except echos of development environment
	are removed.

	* write.c Status indicator now indicates percent finished, and
	estimated time of completion.

Sun Feb 26 01:52:06 1995  Eric Youngdale  (eric@largo)

	* Add patches from Ross Biro to allow you to merge arbitrary
	trees into the image.  This is not compiled in by default but
	you need to add -DADD_FILES when compiling.

Fri Feb 17 02:29:03 1995  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tree.c: Port to Solaris 2.4.  Prefer <sys/mkdev.h> if
	HASMKDEV.  Cast unknown integer types to unsigned long and
	print them with %lu or %lx.

Thu Jan 26 15:25:00 1995  H. Peter Anvin  (hpa@yggdrasil.com)

	* mkisofs.c: Substitute underscore for leading dot in non-Rock
	Ridge filenames, since MS-DOS cannot read files whose names
	begin with a period.

Mon Jan 16 18:31:41 1995  Eric Youngdale  (eric@aib.com)

	* rock.c (generate_rock_ridge_attributes): Only use ROOT
	record for symlinks if we are at the start of the symlink.
	Otherwise just generate an empty entry.

Mon Jan 16 16:19:50 1995  Eric Youngdale  (eric@aib.com)

	* diag/isodump.c: Use isonum_733 instead of trying to dereference
	pointers when trying to decode 733 numbers in the iso9660 image.

	* diag/isovfy.c: Likewise.

	* write.c: Always assign an extent number, even for zero length
	files.  A zero length file with a NULL extent is apparently dropped
	by many readers.

Wed Jan 11 13:46:50 1995  Eric Youngdale  (eric@aib.com)

	* mkisofs.c: Modify extension record to conform to IEEE P1282
	specifications.  This is commented out right now, but a trivial
	change to a #define enables this.   I need to see the specs
	to see whether anything else changed before this becomes final.

	* write.c (FDECL4): Fix so that we properly determine error
	conditions.

	* mkisofs.h: Change rr_attributes to unsigned.

	* tree.c(increment_nlink): Change pnt since rr_attributes is now
	  unsigned.

	Ultrix patches from petav@argon.e20.physik.tu-muenchen.de (Peter Averkamp)

	* rock.c: Fix for ultrix systems, we have 64 bit device numbers.
	Type cast when generating file size.  Change rr_attributes to
	unsigned.

	* mkisofs.c: For ultrix systems, define our own function
	for strdup.  

	* mkisofs.c: Fix usage() since some compilers do not concatenate
	strings properly (i.e. ultrix).

	Bugs found with Sentinel II:

	* write.c: Fix a couple of memory leaks.

	* mkisofs.c: Bugfix - always put a zero byte at end of name
	for ".." entry.

	* tree.c: Set isorec.date from fstatbuf.st_ctime, not current_time,
	  since current_time might not be set.

Sat Dec  3 14:55:42 1994  Eric Youngdale  (eric@andante)

	* mkisofs.c: When returning entry for ".." file, set second byte
	to 0.

	* write.c: Free name and rr_attributes fields when writing.

Mon Nov 28 13:36:27 1994  Eric Youngdale  (eric@andante)

	* mkisofs.h: Change rr_attributes to unsigned.

	* rock.c: Ditto.  Work around >>32 bug in ultrix for 64 bit data types.

	* mkisofs.c (usage): Fix for ultrix - use continuation lines
	instead of assuming that strings are catenated by the compiler.

Mon Jun 20 20:25:26 1994  Eric Youngdale  (eric@esp22)

        * mkisofs.c, mkisofs.8, Makefile (version_string): Bump to pre-1.02.

	* mkisofs.h: Fix declaration of e_malloc to use DECL macros.

	* tree.c: Fix bug in previous change.

	* diag/*.c: Add appropriate copyright notices.

Sat Apr  9 13:30:46 1994  Eric Youngdale  (ericy@cais.com)

        * Configure: New file - shell script that determines a bunch of
	things to properly build mkisofs.

	* Makefile.in: New file - copy of Makefile, but Configure sets a
	few things up for it.

	* tree.c: Do not depend upon opendir to return NULL if we cannot
	open a directory - actually try and read the first entry.  The
	foibles of NFS seem to require this.

	* write.c: Fix definition of xfwrite (Use FDECL4)

	Add some changes to allow more configurability of some of the
	volume header fields:

	* mkisofs.8: Document new configuration options.

	* mkisofs.c: Add variables to hold new fields.  Add function to
	read .mkisofsrc files.

	* defaults.h: Another way of configuring the same things.

	Add some changes from Leo Weppelman leo@ahwau.ahold.nl.

	* mkisofs.c:  Allow -A to specify application ID.  Fix usage(),
	getopt and add case switch.

	* rock.c: Fix handling of device numbers (dev_t high should only
	be used when sizeof(dev_t) > 32 bits).

	Add a bunch of changes from Manuel Bouyer.

	* diag/Makefile: New file.

	* diag/dump.c, diag/isodump.c: Use termios if system supports it.

	* (throughout): Replace all occurences of "malloc" with e_malloc.

	* mkisofs.c:  For NetBSD, attempt to increase the rlimit for
	the size of the data segment to about 33 Mb.

	* mkisofs.c (e_malloc): New function.  Calls malloc, and prints
	nice error message and exits if NULL is returned.

Sun Jan 23 19:23:57 1994  Eric Youngdale  (eric@esp22)

        * mkisofs.c, mkisofs.8, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 1.01.

    Add a bunch of stuff so that mkisofs will work on a VMS system.

	* (ALL): Change any direct use of the "st_ino" field from
	the statbuf to use a macro.

	* mkisofs.h: Define appropriate macros for both VMS and unix.

	* (ALL): Add type casts whenever we use the UNCACHED_DEV macro.

	* rock.c: Wrap a #ifndef VMS around block and character device
	stuff.

	* write.c: Add prototype for strdup if VMS is defined.

	* make.com: Script for building mkisofs on a VMS system.

	* Makefile: Include make.com in the distribution.

	* mkisofs.c: Include <sys/type.h> on VMS systems.

	* tree.c: Include <sys/file.h> and "vms.h" on VMS systems.

	* mkisofs.h (PATH_SEPARATOR, SPATH_SEPARATOR):  New macros
	that define the ascii character that separates the last directory
	component from the filename.

	* tree.c, mkisofs.c: Use them.

	* vms.c: New file.  Contains version of getopt, strdup, opendir,
	readdir and closedir.

	* vms.h: New file.  Defines S_IS* macros.  Define gmtime as
	localtime, since gmtime under VMS returns NULL.

Sat Jan 15 13:57:42 1994  Eric Youngdale  (eric@esp22)

	* mkisofs.h (transparent_compression): New prototype.

	* mkisofs.c (transparent_compression): Declare, use
	'-z' option to turn on.

	* tree.c: Change TRANS.TBL;1 to TRANS.TBL (version gets
	added later, if required).

	* rock.c: If transparent compression requested, verify
	file is really suitable (check magic numbers), and extract
	correct file length to store in SUSP record.

Sat Jan 15 01:57:42 1994  Eric Youngdale  (eric@esp22)

	* write.c (compare_dirs): Bugfix for patch from Jan 6.

	* mkisofs.h (struct directory_entry): Add element total_rr_attr_size.
	(struct file_hash): Add element ce_bytes.

	* write.c (iso_write): Update last_extent_written, as required,
	and check it against last_extent as a sanity check.
	(generate_one_directory): If ce_bytes is non-zero, allocate
	a buffer and fill it with the CE records.  Also, update
	the extent and offset entries in the CE SUSP field and
	output after directory is written.
	(assign_directory_addresses): Allow for CE sectors after each
	directory.

	* tree.c (sort_n_finish): Set field ce_bytes by summing
	the sizes of all CE blocks in each files RR attributes.
	Do not count these bytes for main directory.

	* rock.c (generate_rock_ridge_attributes): Generate
	CE entries to break up large records into manageable sizes.
	Allow long names to be split, and allow long symlinks to be split.
	Allow splitting before each SUSP field as well, to make
	sure we do not screw outselves.

Thu Jan  6 21:47:43 1994  Eric Youngdale  (eric@esp22)

    Bugfix.

	* write.c (compare_dirs): Only compare directory names up to
	the ';' for the version number.

    Add four new options: (1) Full 31 character filenames,
    (2) Omit version number, (3) Omit trailing period from filenames,
    (4) Skip deep directory relocation.

	* iso9660.h: Allow 34 characters for filename.

	* mkisofs.8: Update for new options.

	* mkisofs.c: Add flag variables for new options.
	Mention new options in usage(), tell getopt about
	new options, and set appropriate flags when
	new options are specified.

	* mkisofs.c (iso9660_file_length): Implement new options.

	* mkisofs.h: Declare flag variables for new options.

	* tree.c (sort_n_finish): Increase declaration of newname and
	rootname to 34 characters.  If full_iso9660_filenames in effect,
	use different rules for making unique names.

	* tree.c (scan_directory_tree): Use RR_relocation_depth instead of
	constant for threshold for starting deep directory relocation.

Wed Jan  5 01:32:34 1994  John Brezak (brezak@ch.hp.com)

	* Makefile.bsd: New file.  For NetBSD.

	* rock.c, tree.c: Do not include sys/sysmacros.h for NetBSD.

Fri Dec 31 13:22:52 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@esp22)

        * mkisofs.c, mkisofs.8, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 1.00.

	* tree.c (scan_directory_tree): Handle case where we do not
	have permissions to open a directory.

	* write.c (xfwrite): New function - wrapper for fwrite,
	except that we print message and punt if write fails.

	* write.c: Move include of mkisofs.h and iso9660.h until after
	string.h and stdlib.h is included.

	* write.c: Do not attempt to use strerror on sun systems.

Thu Dec 9  13:17:28 1993  R.-D. Marzusch (marzusch@odiehh.hanse.de)

        * exclude.c, exclude.h: New files.  Contains list of files to
	exclude from consideration.

	* Makefile: Compile exclude.c, add dependencies to other files.

	* mkisofs.8: Describe -x option.

	* mkisofs.c: Include exclude.h, handle -x option.


Fri Dec 10 01:07:43 1993  Peter van der Veen (peterv@qnx.com)
 
 	* mkisofs.c, mkisofs.h: Moved declaration of root_record.
 
 	* mkisofs.h: Added prototype for get_733().
 
 	* write.c(iso_write), tree.c, rock.c(generate_rock_ridge_attributes):
 	Added defines for QNX operation system
 
 	* rock.c(generate_rock_ridge_attributes): symbolic links should
 	not have CONTINUE component flag set unless there are multiple
 	component records, and mkisofs does not generate these.
 	st_ctime was stored as the creation time, changed to attribute time.
 	QNX has a creation time, so that is stored as well under QNX.
 
Thu Oct 28 19:54:38 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.99.

	* write.c(iso_write): Put hour, minute, second into date fields in
	volume descriptor.

	* write.c (iso_write): Set file_structure_version to 1, instead of
	' ' (Seems to screw up Macs).

Sun Oct 17 01:13:36 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.98.

    Increment nlink in root directory when rr_moved directory is present.

        * tree.c (increment_nlink): New function.

	* tree.c (finish_cl_pl_entries): Call increment_nlink for all
	references to the root directory.

	* tree.c (root_statbuf): New variable.

	* tree.c (scan_directory_tree): Initialize root_statbuf when we
	stat the root directory.

	* tree.c (generate_reloc_directory): Use root_statbuf when
	generating the Rock Ridge stuff for the ".." entry in the
	reloc_dir.

	* tree.c (scan_directory_tree): Use root_statbuf when generating
	the ".." entry in the root directory.

Sat Oct 16 10:28:30 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

    Fix path tables so that they are sorted.

	* tree.c (assign_directory_addresses): Move to write.c

	* write.c (generate_path_tables): Create an array of pointers to
	the individual directories, and sort it based upon the name and
	the parent path table index.  Then update all of the indexes and
	repeat the sort until the path table indexes no longer need to be
	changed, and then write the path table.

    Fix problem where hard links were throwing off the total extent count.

	* write.c (iso_write): Call assign_file_addresses, and then
	use last_extent to determine how big the volume is.

	* write.c (generate_one_directory): Decrement n_data_extents
	for hard links to non-directories so that the expected number
	of extents is written correctly.

	* write.c(assign_file_addresses): New function.

Fri Oct 15 22:35:43 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

    The standard says we should do these things:

	* tree.c (generate_reloc_directory): Add RR attributes to
	the rr_moved directory.

	* mkisofs.c(main): Change ER text strings back to recommended
	values.

Tue Oct 12 21:07:38 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.97.  

	* tree.c (scan_directory_tree): Do not insert PL entry into
	root directory record (i.e. !parent)

	* tree.c (finish_cl_pl_entries): Do not rely upon name
	comparison to locate parent - use d_entry->self instead,
	which is guaranteed to be correct.

	* mkisofs.h: New variable n_data_extents.

	* tree.c: Declare and initialize n_data_extents to 0.
	(scan_directory_tree) for non-directories, add
	ROUND_UP(statbuf.st_size) to n_data_extents.
	(sort_n_finish): Increment n_data_extents for translation tables,
	as appropriate.

	* write.c(iso_write): Add n_data_extents to the
	volume_space_size field.

	* hash.c(add_hash): If size != 0 and extent == 0, or
	if size == 0 and extent != 0, then complain about
	inserting this into the hash table.  Kind of a sanity check.

Sat Oct  9 16:39:15 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.96.  

	Numerous bugfixes, thanks to a one-off disc from rab@cdrom.com.

	* write.c(generate_one_directory): Wait until after we have
	filled in the starting_extent field to s_entry before calling
	add_hash.  This fixes a problem where the hash table gets an
	extent of 0 for all regular files, and this turns up when you have
	hard links on the disc. (The hash table allows us to have each
	hard link point to the same extent on the cdrom, thereby saving
	some space).

	* tree.c(scan_directory_tree): Set statbuf.st_dev and
	statbuf.st_ino to the UNCACHED numbers for symlinks that we
	are not following.  This prevents the function find_hash from
	returning an inode that cooresponds to the file the symlink points
	to, which in turn prevents generate_one_directory from filling in
	a bogus file length (should be zero for symlinks).

	* tree.c(scan_directory_tree): Always call lstat for the file
	so that non-RockRidge discs get correct treatment of symlinks.
	Improve error message when we ignore a symlink on a non-RR disc.
	
	* write.c(generate_one_directory): Set fields for starting_extent
	and size in the "." and ".." entries before we add them to the
	file hash.  Fixes problems with incorrect backlinks for second
	level directories.

Wed Oct  6 19:53:40 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

	* write.c (write_one_file): Print message and punt if we are
	unable to open the file.

	* tree.c(scan_directory_tree): For regular files, use the access
	function to verify that the file is readable in the first place.
	If not, issue a warning and skip it.  For directories, it probably
	does not matter, since we would not be able to descend into them
	in the first place.

Wed Sep 29 00:02:47 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.95.

	* write.c, tree.c: Cosmetic changes to printed information.

        * tree.c(scan_directory_tree): Set size to zero for
	special stub entries that correspond to the
	relocated directories.  Hopefully last big bug.

	* mkisofs.h: Change TABLE_INODE, UNCACHED_* macros
	to be 0x7fff... to be compatible with signed datatypes.

Mon Sep 27 20:14:49 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.94.

	* write.c (write_path_tables): Actually search the
	directory for the matching entry in case we renamed
	the directory because of a name conflict.

	* tree.c(scan_directory_tree): Take directory_entry pointer
	as second argument so that we can create a backpointer
	in the directory structure that points back to the original
	dir.

	* mkisofs.c: Fix call to scan_directory_tree to use new calling
	sequence.

	* write.c(generate_one_directory): Punt if the last_extent counter
	ever exceeds 700Mb/2048.  Print name of responsible file,
	extent counter, and starting extent.  Perhaps we can catch it in
	the act.

Sun Sep 26 20:58:05 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.93.

	* tree.c(scan_directory_tree): Handle symlinks better.  Either
	leave them as symlinks, or erase any trace that they were a
	symlink but do not do it 1/2 way as before.  Also, watch for
	directory loops created with symlinks.

	* mkisofs.h: Add new flag follow_links.

	* mkisofs.c: Add command line switch "-f" to toggle follow_links.

	* mkisofs.8: Document new switch.

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.92.

	* mkisofs.c: Make sure path is an actual directory before trying
	to scan it.

	* mkisofs.h: Add DECL and FDECL? macros for sparc like systems.
	Do proper define of optind and optarg under SVr4.

	* tree.c: Change translation table name from YMTRANS.TBL to TRANS.TBL.

	* mkisofs.c: Neaten up message in extension record when RRIP is
	in use.

	* Throughout - change all function declarations so that
	traditional C compilers (i.e. sparc) will work.

	* Makefile: Change to use system default C compiler.

	* mkisofs.c: Add some stuff so that this will compile under VMS.
	Many things missing for VMS still.

	* iso9660.h: Do not use zero length array in struct definition.

	* tree.c (sort_n_finish): Account for this.

	* Change copyright notice.


Wed Aug 25 08:06:51 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.91.

	* mkisofs.h: Only  include sys/dir.h for linux.  Other systems
	will need other things.

	* Makefile:  Use OBJS to define list of object files.

Sun Aug 22 20:55:17 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.9.

	systems. 

Fri Aug 20 00:14:36 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.8.

	* rock.c: Do not mask off write permissions from posix file modes.

Wed Aug 18 09:02:12 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.7.

        *  rock.c: Do not  write  NM field  for . and .. (redundant and a
	waste of space).

	* mkisofs.c: Take -P and -p options for publisher and preparer id
	fields.

	* write.c: Store  publisher and preparer id  in  volume
	descriptor.

	* rock.c: Write  optional  SP field to identify  SUSP.  Write
	optional CE field to point to the extension header.

	* tree.c: Request  SP and  CE fields be added to root directory.

        * tree.c: Fix bug in name conflict resolution.

        * write.c: Fill in date fields in the  colume descriptor.

        * write.c (write_one_file): If the file is large enough, write  in
	chunks of 16 sectors to improve performance.

	* hash.c (add_hash, find_hash, etc): Do  not hash s_entry, instead
	store relevant info in hash structure (we free s_entry  structs as
	we write files, and we need to have access to the hash table  the
	whole  way through.

	* write.c: Add a few statistics about directory sizes, RR sizes,
	translation table sizes, etc.

	* tree.c: Use major, not MAJOR.  Same for minor.  Define S_ISSOCK
	and S_ISLNK if not defined.

	* rock.c: Define S_ISLNK if not defined.

	* mkisofs.c: Print out max memory usage.  Fix bug in call to getopt.

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.6.

	* tree.c: Simplify the calculation of isorec.len,  isorec.name_len
	and the calculation of the path table sizes by doing it all at
	one point after  conflict resolution is done.

	* tree.c: scan_directory_tree is now  responsible for generating
	the line that goes into the YMTRANS.TBL file.  These lines are
	collected later  on into something that will be dumped to the
	file. Correctly handle all of the special file types.

Mon Aug 16 21:59:47 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.5.

	* mkisofs.c: Add -a option  (to force all files to be
	transferred).  Remove find_file_hash stuff.

	* write.c: Pad length even if Rock Ridge is not in use.

	* hash.c: Rewrite hash_file_* stuff so that it  can be used to
	easily  detect (and look up) filenames that have been  accepted
	for use  in this directory.  Used for name collision detection.

	* tree.c (sort_n_finish): If two names collide, generate a unique
	one (verified with the hash routines).  Change the lower priority
	name if there is a difference.



Sat Aug 14 13:18:21 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.4.

	* tree.c (load_translation_table): New  function - read
	YMTRANS.TBL.  (scan_directory_tree) Call it.

	* mkisofs.c (iso9660_file_length): Call find_file_hash to see
	if translated name is specified.  If so, use it.

	flush_file_hash): New functions for hashing stuff from
	YMTRANS.TBL.

	* mkisofs.h: Add a bunch of prototypes for the new functions.

	* mkisofs.8: Update.

        * mkisofs.c, Makefile (version_string): Bump to 0.3.

        * Makefile: Add version number to tar file in dist target.

	* mkisofs.c: Call finish_cl_pl_entries() after directories have
	been generated, and extent numbers assigned.

	* write.c (generate_one_directory): Update s_entry->size  for
	directories (as well as isorec.size).

	* rock.c:  Add  code to generate CL, PL, and RE entries.  The
	extent numbers for the CL and PL  entries are  NULL, and these
	are filled in  later once we know where they actually belong.

	* mkisofs.h: Add parent_rec to directory_entry.  Used to fix CL/PL
	stuff.

	* tree.c (scan_directory_tree): Set  flag to generate  CL/PL/RE
	entries  as required, update sizes as well.

Fri Aug 13 19:49:30 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

        * mkisofs.c (version_string): Bump to 0.2.

	* hash.c: Do not use entries with inode  == 0xffffffff or dev  ==
	0xffff.

	* write.c (write_path_tables):  Strip leading directory specifications.

	* mkisofs.h: Add  definition for reloc_dir symbol.  Add prototype
	for sort_n_finish, add  third parameter  to  scan_directory_tree
	(for true parent, when directories are relocated).

	* mkisofs.c (main): Modify call to scan_directory_tree.  Call
	sort_n_finish for reloc_dir.

	* tree.c (sort_n_finish): New function - moved code from
	scan_directory_tree. 

	* tree.c (generate_reloc_directory): New function.  Generate
	directory to hold relocated directories.

	* tree.c (scan_directory_tree): Strip leading directories when
	generating this_dir->name.  If depth is  too great,  then move
	directory to reloc_dir (creating if it does not exist, and leave
	a dummy (non-directory) entry  in the regular directory  so that
	we can eventually add the required Rock Ridge record.

	* tree.c (scan_directory_tree): Use s_entry instead of sort_dir,
	assign to this_dir->contents sooner.

Thu Aug 12 22:38:17 1993  Eric Youngdale  (eric@kafka)

	* mkisofs.c (usage): Fix syntax.

	* mkisofs.c (main): Add new argument to scan_directory_tree

	* tree.c (scan_directory_tree): If directory is at  depth 8 or
	more, create rr_moved directory in main directory.
