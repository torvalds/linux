     Originally generated by Doxygen 1.2.12.

     This used to be surrounded by /* */ marks and tagged with @mainpage, so
     that Doxygen would create the index page from it.  HOWEVER, Doxygen
     ignores all but the most basic HTML tags, and even with those it strips
     all the attributes.  (See, the HTML you write for @mainpage isn't used
     directly; it all gets run through Doxygen and re-output.)  So lots of
     tags were all being mangled.

     Funk 'dat.  Now we let Doxygen do whatever it feels like doing for the
     index page, and then we just flat copy this over top of it.  Voila!
     Tags actually work like they're supposed to in HTML.

<h1>libstdc++-v3 Source Documentation</h1>

<h2>Documentation Overview</h2>

<p class="smallertext">@LEVEL@-level docs, generated @DATE@.</p>

<p>There are two types of documentation for libstdc++-v3.  One is the
   distribution documentation, which can be read online at
   <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/documentation.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/documentation.html</a>
   or offline from docs/html/documentation.html in the library source
   directory.
</p>

<p>The other type is the source documentation, of which this is the first page.
   Both &quot;user-level&quot; and &quot;maintainer-level&quot; source
   documentation is produced:  user-level docs are for the users of this
   library.  The maint-level docs are for those interested in the underlying
   workings of the library; they include all the user-level docs plus
   additional notes and additional classes/functions/etc.
</p>

<p>Here are quick links to the pages which we seem to use the most; a full
   index is at the bottom:
   <!-- Keep this in sync with below. -->
   <ul>
    <li><a href="annotated.html">Compound List</a>
    <li><a href="classes.html">Alphabetical List</a>
    <li><a href="namespaces.html">Namespace List</a>
    <li><a href="files.html">File List</a>
    <li><a href="modules.html">Modules</a>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2> Generating this file </h2>
<p>These HTML pages are automatically generated, along with the man pages.
   The Makefile rules <code> 'make doxygen' </code> and
   <code> 'make doxygen-maint' </code> in the libstdc++-v3 build directory
   generates these pages using a tool called, appropriately enough, Doxygen.
   To learn more about Doxygen, take a look at
   <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">
   <!-- snagged from the generated page -->

   </a>
</p>

<p>The libstdc++-v3 configuration files needed to generate doxygen output
   are located:
   <ul><li><code>docs/doxygen/user.cfg.in</code>
       <li><code>docs/doxygen/run_doxygen</code>
   </ul>
</p>

<h2> libstdc++-v3 doxygen style guide </h2>
<p>In general, libstdc++-v3 files should be formatted according to the
   GNU C++ Coding Standard rules found in the file <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/17_intro/C++STYLE">C++STYLE</a>.
   Before any doxygen-specific formatting tweaks are made, please try to
   make sure that the initial formatting is sound.
</p>

<h2> Full page index </h2>
<p>Here are entry points to all the pages generated by Doxygen:
   <ul>
    <li><a href="index.html">Main Page</a>
    <li><a href="modules.html">Modules</a>
    <li><a href="namespaces.html">Namespace List</a>
    <li><a href="hierarchy.html">Class Hierarchy</a>
    <li><a href="classes.html">Alphabetical List</a>
    <li><a href="annotated.html">Compound List</a>
    <li><a href="files.html">File List</a>
    <li><a href="namespacemembers.html">Namespace Members</a>
    <li><a href="functions.html">Compound Members</a>
    <li><a href="globals.html">File Members</a>
    <li><a href="todo.html">TODO List</a> (This is incomplete... how ironic.)
   </ul>
