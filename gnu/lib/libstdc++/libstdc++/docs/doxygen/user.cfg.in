# Doxyfile 1.3-rc2

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

### When doxygen is run, the current directory is the top of the
### libstdc++-v3 build directory.  Keep this in mind while writing
### relative-path directories.
###
### Currently this is not really run through autoconf; it just looks that way.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = NO

# The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make Doxygen
