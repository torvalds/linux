<h2><a name="prereqs">Tools you will need beforehand</a></h2>
   <p>You will need a recent version of g++ to compile the snapshot of
      libstdc++, such as one of the GCC 3.x snapshots (insert standard
      caveat about using snapshots rather than formal releases).  You will
      need the full source distribution to whatever compiler release you are
      using.  The GCC snapshots can be had from one of the sites on their
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html">mirror list</a>.  If you are
      using a 2.x compiler, see
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/libstdc++/status.html">the status page</a>
      first.
   </p>

   <p>In addition, if you plan to modify the makefiles or regenerate the
      configure scripts you'll need recent versions of the GNU Autotools:
      autoconf (version 2.50 or later),
      automake (version 1.4 or later),    <!-- special version? -->
      and libtool (multilanguage, version 1.4 or later),  <!-- really? -->
      in order to rebuild the files.
      These tools are all required to be installed in the same location
      (most linux distributions install these tools by default, so no
      worries as long as the versions are correct).
   </p>

   <p>To test your build, you will need either DejaGNU 1.4 (to run
      <code>'make check'</code> like
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/test.html">the rest of GCC</a>),
      or Bash 2.x (to run <code>'make check-script'</code>).
   </p>

   <p>As of June 19, 2000, libstdc++ attempts to use tricky and
      space-saving features of the GNU toolchain, enabled with
      <code>-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections
      -Wl,--gc-sections</code>.  To obtain maximum benefit from this,
      binutils after this date should also be used (bugs were fixed
      with C++ exception handling related to this change in
      libstdc++-v3).  The version of these tools should be
      <code>2.10.90</code>, or later, and you can get snapshots (as
      well as releases) of binutils
      <a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/binutils">here</a>. The
      configure process will automatically detect and use these
      features if the underlying support is present.
   </p>

   <p>If you are using a 3.1-series libstdc++ snapshot, then the
      requirements are slightly more stringent: the compiler sources
      must also be 3.1 or later (for both technical and licensing
      reasons), and your binutils must be 2.11.95 or later if you want
      to use symbol versioning in shared libraries. Again, the
      configure process will automatically detect and use these
      features if the underlying support is present.
   </p>

   <p>Finally, a few system-specific requirements: </p>
   <dl>
      <dt> linux </dt>

      <dd>If gcc 3.1.0 or later on is being used on linux, an attempt
      will be made to use "C" library functionality necessary for C++
      named locale support.  For gcc 3.2.1 and later, this means that
      glibc 2.2.5 or later is required.

      <p>
      The configure option --enable-clocale can be used force a
      particular behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
      If the 'gnu' locale model is being used, the following locales
      are used and tested in the libstdc++ testsuites.  The first column
      is the name of the locale, the second is the character set it is
      expected to use.
      </p>
<pre>
de_DE               ISO-8859-1
de_DE@euro          ISO-8859-15
en_HK               ISO-8859-1
en_PH               ISO-8859-1
en_US               ISO-8859-1
en_US.ISO-8859-1    ISO-8859-1
en_US.ISO-8859-15   ISO-8859-15
en_US.UTF-8         UTF-8
es_MX               ISO-8859-1
fr_FR               ISO-8859-1
fr_FR@euro          ISO-8859-15
it_IT               ISO-8859-1
ja_JP.eucjp         EUC-JP
se_NO.UTF-8         UTF-8
</pre>
      <p>Failure to have the underlying "C" library locale
      information installed will mean that C++ named locales for the
      above regions will not work: because of this, the libstdc++
      testsuite will not pass the named locale tests. If this isn't an
      issue, don't worry about it. If named locales are needed, the
      underlying locale information must be installed. Note that
      rebuilding libstdc++ after the "C" locales are installed is not
      necessary.
      </p>

      <p>To install support for locales, do only one of the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> install all locales
          <ul>
            <li>with RedHat Linux:
        <p> <code> export LC_ALL=C </code> </p>
        <p> <code> rpm -e glibc-common --nodeps </code> </p>
        <p> <code> rpm -i --define "_install_langs all"
                   glibc-common-2.2.5-34.i386.rpm </code> </p>
             </li>
             <li> (instructions for other operating systems solicited) </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> install just the necessary locales
          <ul>
            <li>with Debian Linux:
        <p> Add the above list, as shown, to the file
            <code>/etc/locale.gen</code> </p>
        <p> run <code>/usr/sbin/locale-gen</code> </p>
            </li>
            <li> on most Unix-like operating systems:
        <p> <code> localedef -i de_DE -f ISO-8859-1 de_DE </code> </p>
        <p> (repeat for each entry in the above list) </p>
            </li>
            <li> (instructions for other operating systems solicited) </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </dd>
   </dl>

<h2><a name="srcsetup">Setting up the source directories</a></h2>
   <p>The following definitions will be used throughout the rest of this
      document:
   </p>
      <ul>
         <li><em>gccsrcdir</em>:  The directory holding the source of the
                 compiler.  It should have several subdirectories like
                 <em>gccsrcdir</em>/libiberty and <em>gccsrcdir</em>/gcc.
         </li>
         <li><em>libsrcdir</em>:  The directory holding the source of the
                 C++ library.
         </li>
         <li><em>gccbuilddir</em>:  The build directory for the compiler
                 in <em>gccsrcdir</em>.  GCC requires that it be built in
                 a different directory than its sources.
         </li>
         <li><em>libbuilddir</em>:  The build directory for libstdc++.
         </li>
         <li><em>destdir</em>:  The eventual installation directory for
                 the compiler/libraries, set with the --prefix option to
                 the configure script.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Note: </p>
      <ol>
         <li>The 3.0 version and following are intended to replace the
             library that comes with the compiler, so <em>libsrcdir</em>
             and <em>libbuilddir</em> must be contained under
             <em>gccsrcdir</em> and <em>gccbuilddir</em>, respectively.
         </li>
         <li>The source, build, and installation directories should
             not be parents of one another; i.e., these should all be
             separate directories. Please don't build out of the
             source directory.
         </li>
      </ol>

   <p>Check out or download the GCC sources: the resulting source directory
      (<code>gcc</code> or <code>gcc-3.0.3</code>, for example) is
      <em>gccsrcdir</em>.
      Once in <em>gccsrcdir</em>, you'll need to rename or delete the
      libstdc++-v3 directory which comes with that snapshot:
   </p>
   <pre>
   mv libstdc++-v3 libstdc++-v3-previous  <strong>[OR]</strong>
   rm -r libstdc++-v3</pre>
   <p>Next, unpack the libstdc++-v3 library tarball into this
      <em>gccsrcdir</em> directory; it will create a
      <em>libsrcdir</em> called <code>libstdc++-<em>version</em></code>:
   </p>
   <pre>
   gzip -dc libstdc++-version.tar.gz | tar xf -</pre>
   <p>Finally, rename <em>libsrcdir</em> to <code>libstdc++-v3</code> so that
      gcc's configure flags will be able to deal with the new library.
   </p>
   <pre>
   mv <em>libsrcdir</em> libstdc++-v3</pre>


<hr />
<h2><a name="config">Configuring</a></h2>
   <p>If you have never done this before, you should read the basic
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/">GCC Installation
      Instructions</a> first.  Read <em>all of them</em>.
      <strong>Twice.</strong>
   </p>
   <p>When building libstdc++-v3 you'll have to configure
      the entire <em>gccsrcdir</em> directory.  The full list of libstdc++-v3
      specific configuration options, not dependent on the specific compiler
      release being used, can be found <a href="configopts.html">here</a>.
   </p>
   <p>Consider possibly using --enable-languages=c++ to save time by only
      building the C++ language parts.
   </p>

   <pre>
   cd <em>gccbuilddir</em>
   <em>gccsrcdir</em>/configure --prefix=<em>destdir</em> --other-opts...</pre>


<hr />
<h2><a name="install">Building and installing the library</a></h2>
   <p>Now you have a few options:</p>
   <h3>[re]building <em>everything</em></h3>
   <p>If you're building GCC from scratch, you can do the usual
      <code> 'make bootstrap' </code> here, and libstdc++-v3 will be built
      as its default C++ library.  The generated g++ will magically
      use the correct headers, link against the correct library
      binary, and in general using libstdc++-v3 will be a piece of
      cake.  You're done; run <code>'make install'</code> (see the GCC
      installation instructions) to put the new compiler and libraries
      into place.
   </p>

   <h3>[re]building only libstdc++</h3>
   <p>To rebuild just libstdc++, use: </p>
   <pre>
   make all-target-libstdc++-v3</pre>
   <p>
      This will configure and build the C++ library in the
      <em>gccbuilddir/cpu-vendor-os/</em>libstdc++ directory.
   </p>
   <p>If you are rebuilding from a previous build [attempt], some
      information is kept in a cache file.  This is stored in
      <em>gccbuilddir/cpu-vendor-os/</em> if you are building with
      multilibs (the default), or in
      <em>gccbuilddir/cpu-vendor-os/</em>libstdc++-v3 if you have
      multilibs disabled.  The filename is config.cache; if previous
      information is causing problems, you can delete it entirely, or
      simply edit it and remove lines.
   </p>
   <p>You're done.  Now install the rebuilt pieces with</p>
   <pre>
   make install</pre>
   <p>or</p>
   <pre>
   make install-gcc
   make install-target-libstdc++-v3</pre>


<hr />
<h2><a name="postinstall">Post-installation</a></h2>
   <p>Installation will create the <em>destdir</em> directory and
      populate it with subdirectories:
   </p>
   <pre>
   lib/
   include/c++/<em>gcc-version</em>
      backward/
      bits/
      <em>cpu-vendor-os</em>/bits/
      ext/</pre>
   <p>If you used the version-specific-libs configure option, then most of
      the headers and library files will be moved under
      <code>lib/gcc-lib/</code> instead.
   </p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="usage">Using the library</a></h2>
   <h3>Find the new library at runtime (shared linking only)</h3>
       <p>If you only built a static library (libstdc++.a), or if you
          specified static linking, you don't have to worry about this.
          But if you built a shared library (libstdc++.so) and linked
          against it, then you will need to find that library when you
          run the executable.
       </p>
       <p>Methods vary for different platforms and different styles, but
          the usual ones are printed to the screen during installation.
          They include:
       </p>
       <ul>
          <li>At runtime set LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your environment correctly,
              so that the shared library for libstdc++ can be found and
              loaded.  Be certain that you understand all of the other
              implications and behavior of LD_LIBRARY_PATH first (few
              people do, and they get into trouble).
          </li>
          <li>Compile the path to find the library at runtime into the
              program.  This can be done by passing certain options to g++,
              which will in turn pass them on to the linker.  The exact
              format of the options is dependent on which linker you use:
              <ul>
  <li>GNU ld (default on Linux):<code>  -Wl,--rpath,<em>destdir</em>/lib</code></li>
  <li>IRIX ld:<code>  -Wl,-rpath,<em>destdir</em>/lib</code></li>
  <li>Solaris ld:<code>  -Wl,-R<em>destdir</em>/lib</code></li>
  <li>More...?  Let us know!</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
       </ul>
       <p>Use the <code>ldd(1)</code> utility to show which library the system
          thinks it will get at runtime.
       </p>
       <p>A libstdc++.la file is also installed, for use with Libtool.  If
          you use Libtool to create your executables, these details are
          taken care of for you.
       </p>
