Subject: new readline example
Message-ID: <14094.12094.527305.199695@mrclean.Stanford.EDU>

Chet,

I've been using readline 4.0. Specifically, I've been using the perl
version Term::ReadLine::Gnu. It works great.

Anyway, I've been playing around the alternate interface and I wanted
to contribute a little C program, callback.c, to you that you could
use as an example of the alternate interface in the /examples
directory of the readline distribution.

My example shows how, using the alternate interface, you can
interactively change the prompt (which is very nice imo). Also, I
point out that you must roll your own terminal setting when using the
alternate interface because readline depreps (using your parlance) the
terminal while in the user callback. I try to demostrate what I mean
with an example. I've included the program below.

To compile, I just put the program in the examples directory and made
the appropriate changes to the EXECUTABLES and OBJECTS line and added
an additional target 'callback'.

I compiled on my Sun Solaris2.6 box using Sun's cc.

Let me know what you think.

Jeff

/* This little examples demonstrates the alternate interface to using readline.
 * In the alternate interface, the user maintains control over program flow and
 * only calls readline when STDIN is readable. Using the alternate interface,
 * you can do anything else while still using readline (like talking to a
 * network or another program) without blocking.
 *
 * Specifically, this program highlights two importants features of the
 * alternate interface. The first is the ability to interactively change the
 * prompt, which can't be done using the regular interface since rl_prompt is
 * read-only.
 * 
 * The second feature really highlights a subtle point when using the alternate
 * interface. That is, readline will not alter the terminal when inside your
 * callback handler. So let's so, your callback executes a user command that
 * takes a non-trivial amount of time to complete (seconds). While your
 * executing the command, the user continues to type keystrokes and expects them
 * to be re-echoed on the new prompt when it returns. Unfortunately, the default
 * terminal configuration doesn't do this. After the prompt returns, the user
 * must hit one additional keystroke and then will see all of his previous
 * keystrokes. To illustrate this, compile and run this program. Type "sleep" at
 * the prompt and then type "bar" before the prompt returns (you have 3
 * seconds). Notice how "bar" is re-echoed on the prompt after the prompt
 * returns? This is what you expect to happen. Now comment out the 4 lines below
 * the line that says COMMENT LINE BELOW. Recompile and rerun the program and do
 * the same thing. When the prompt returns, you should not see "bar". Now type
 * "f", see how "barf" magically appears? This behavior is un-expected and not
 * desired.
