Subject: Use of Readline
Reply-to: rms@gnu.org

I think Allbery's suggestion is a good one.  So please add this text
in a suitable place.  Please don't put it in the GPL itself; that
should be the same as the GPL everywhere else.  Putting it in the
README and/or the documentation would be a good idea.


======================================================================
Our position on the use of Readline through a shared-library linking
mechanism is that there is no legal difference between shared-library
linking and static linking--either kind of linking combines various
modules into a single larger work.  The conditions for using Readline
in a larger work are stated in section 3 of the GNU GPL.
