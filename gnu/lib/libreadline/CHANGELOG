	  autoconf set the value itself in the Makefile
	- removed a stray `-' before $(RANLIB) in the `install' recipe

doc/Makefile.in
	- add a VPATH assignment so the documentation is not remade if it's
	  already up-to-date in the distribution

configure.in
	- call AC_SUBST(LOCAL_LDFLAGS), since Makefile.in contains
	  @LOCAL_LDFLAGS@

				   4/18
				   ----
[readline-2.2 released]

				   4/20
				   ----
Makefile.in
	- make `libhistory.a' a dependency of `install'
	- fixed a typo in the recipe for `install' that copied libreadline.a
	  to libhistory.old right after installing it

				   4/27
				   ----
doc/Makefile.in
	- install {readline,history}.info out of the source directory if
	  they are not found in the current (build) directory -- only an
	  issue if the libraries are built in a different directory than
	  the source directory

				    5/1
				    ---
support/shobj-conf
	- script from the bash distribution to do shared object and library
	  configuration

Makefile.in, shlib/Makefile.in
	- make sure savestring.c is compiled and added to libreadline and
	  libhistory

Makefile.in
	- bumped SHLIB_MAJOR up to 4 since we've augmented the library
	  API

rlstdc.h
	- new file

Makefile.in
	- rlstdc.h is now one of the installed headers

				    8/3
				    ---
shlib/Makefile.in
	- made the suffix rule that creates xx.so from xx.c write the
	  compiler output to `a.o', which is then mv'd to xx.so, because
	  some compilers (Sun WSpro 4.2, for example) don't allow any
	  suffixes other than `.o' for `cc -c' (not even `a.out')

				   9/15
				   ----

Makefile.in
	- AR and ARFLAGS are now substituted by configure, used in recipes
	  that build the libraries

				   ----
Makefile.in
	- removed savestring.o from object file list

				   10/28
				   -----
shlib/Makefile.in
	- don't use a fixed filename in the .c.so suffix rule to avoid
	  problems with parallel makes

				   12/21
				   -----
support/shlib-install
	- new script to install shared readline and history libraries

shlib/Makefile.in
	- changed to call shlib-install for install and uninstall targets

[readline-4.0-beta1 frozen]

				   -----
configure.in
	- call AC_SUBST for SHOBJ_XLDFLAGS and SHLIB_LIBS

shlib/Makefile.in
	- SHOBJ_XLDFLAGS and SHLIB_LIBS are now substituted by configure
	- add $(SHLIB_LIBS) at end of command line that builds the shared
	  libraries (currently needed only by AIX 4.2)

				   12/31
				   -----
MANIFEST, MANIFEST.doc
	- the TOC html files are no longer generated and no longer part of
	  the distribution

				 2/18/1999
				 ---------
configure.in
	- set MAKE_SHELL to /bin/sh and substitute into the Makefiles

	- set SHELL from @MAKE_SHELL@

[readline-4.0 released]

doc/Makefile.in
	- removed references to HTMLTOC, since separate HTML table-of-contents
	  files are no longer created

	- clean target now removes readline and readline.exe in case they
	  get built

				    4/8
				    ---

xmalloc.h, rlprivate.h, rlshell.h
	- new files

Makefile.in,shlib/Makefile.in
	- add dependencies on xmalloc.h, rlshell.h
	- add xmalloc.h, rlprivate.h, rlshell.h to list of header files

	- add dependencies on rlprivate.h

				   4/13
				   ----
doc/Makefile.in
	- add variable, PSDVI, which is the desired resolution of the
	  generated postscript files.  Set to 300 because I don't have
	  any 600-dpi printers
	- set LANGUAGE= before calling makeinfo, so messages are in English
	- add rluserman.{info,dvi,ps,html} to appropriate variables
	- add rules to create rluserman.{info,dvi,ps,html}

	- SHLIB_MAJOR and SHLIB_MINOR shared library version numbers are
	  constructed from $LIBRARY_VERSION and substituted into Makefiles

				    5/5
				    ---
support/shlib-install
	- OSF/1 installs shared libraries like Solaris

Makefile.in
	- broke the header file install and uninstall into two new targets:
	  install-headers and uninstall-headers
	- install and uninstall depend on install-headers and uninstall-headers
	  respectively
	- changed install-shared and uninstall-shared targets to depend on
	  install-headers and uninstall-headers, respectively, so users may
	  choose to install only the shared libraries.  I'm not sure about
	  the uninstall one yet -- maybe it should check whether or not
	  the static libraries are installed and not remove the header files
	  if they are

				    9/3
				    ---
configure.in, config.h.in
	- added test for memmove (for later use)

				   3/27
				   ----
support/shlib-install
	- install shared libraries unwritable by anyone on HP-UX
	- changed symlinks to relative pathnames on all platforms

	- add call to AC_PROG_MAKE_SET

				   8/30
				   ----
shlib/Makefile.in
	- change the soname bound into the shared libraries, so it includes
	  only the major version number.  If it includes the minor version,
	  programs depending on it must be rebuilt (which may or may not be
	  a bad thing)

				    ---
examples/rlfe.c
	- add -l option to log input and output (-a option appends to logfile)

				   ----
compat.c
	- new file, with backwards-compatibility function definitions

Makefile.in,shlib/Makefile.in
	- make sure that compat.o/compat.so are built and linked apppropriately

support/shobj-conf
	- picked up bash version, which means that shared libs built on
	  linux and BSD/OS 4.x will have an soname that does not include
	  the minor version number

				   11/13
				   -----
examples/rlfe.c
	- rlfe can perform filename completion for relative pathnames in the
	  inferior process's context if the OS supports /proc/PID/cwd (linux
	  does it OK, Solaris is slightly warped, none of the BSDs have it)
