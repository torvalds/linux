# Most releases of AIX 3.1 include an incorrect internal version of copysign
# in libc.a for use by some libc public functions including modf.  The public
# version of copysign in libm.a is usable.  For the sake of libg++ (which
# uses modf), we add copysign here.  Supposedly, this problem is fixed in AIX
# 3.1.8 and above, including all releases of AIX 3.2.
