@deftypefn Extension char* choose_temp_base (void)

Return a prefix for temporary file names or @code{NULL} if unable to
find one.  The current directory is chosen if all else fails so the
program is exited if a temporary directory can't be found (@code{mktemp}
fails).  The buffer for the result is obtained with @code{xmalloc}.

This function is provided for backwards compatability only.  Its use is
not recommended.
