.SH "NAME"
ld \- The GNU linker
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
ld [\fBoptions\fR] \fIobjfile\fR ...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBld\fR combines a number of object and archive files, relocates
their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in
compiling a program is to run \fBld\fR.
.PP
\&\fBld\fR accepts Linker Command Language files written in
a superset of \s-1AT&T\s0's Link Editor Command Language syntax,
to provide explicit and total control over the linking process.
.PP
This man page does not describe the command language; see the
\&\fBld\fR entry in \f(CW\*(C`info\*(C'\fR for full details on the command
language and on other aspects of the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.
.PP
This version of \fBld\fR uses the general purpose \s-1BFD\s0 libraries
to operate on object files. This allows \fBld\fR to read, combine, and
write object files in many different formats\-\-\-for example, \s-1COFF\s0 or
\&\f(CW\*(C`a.out\*(C'\fR.  Different formats may be linked together to produce any
available kind of object file.
.PP
Aside from its flexibility, the \s-1GNU\s0 linker is more helpful than other
linkers in providing diagnostic information.  Many linkers abandon
execution immediately upon encountering an error; whenever possible,
\&\fBld\fR continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors
(or, in some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).
.PP
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker \fBld\fR is meant to cover a broad range of situations,
and to be as compatible as possible with other linkers.  As a result,
you have many choices to control its behavior.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but in actual
practice few of them are used in any particular context.
For instance, a frequent use of \fBld\fR is to link standard Unix
object files on a standard, supported Unix system.  On such a system, to
link a file \f(CW\*(C`hello.o\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ld \-o <output> /lib/crt0.o hello.o \-lc
.Ve
.PP
This tells \fBld\fR to produce a file called \fIoutput\fR as the
result of linking the file \f(CW\*(C`/lib/crt0.o\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`hello.o\*(C'\fR and
the library \f(CW\*(C`libc.a\*(C'\fR, which will come from the standard search
directories.  (See the discussion of the \fB\-l\fR option below.)
.PP
Some of the command-line options to \fBld\fR may be specified at any
point in the command line.  However, options which refer to files, such
as \fB\-l\fR or \fB\-T\fR, cause the file to be read at the point at
which the option appears in the command line, relative to the object
files and other file options.  Repeating non-file options with a
different argument will either have no further effect, or override prior
occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of that
option.  Options which may be meaningfully specified more than once are
noted in the descriptions below.
.PP
Non-option arguments are object files or archives which are to be linked
together.  They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line
options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between
an option and its argument.
.PP
Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can
specify other forms of binary input files using \fB\-l\fR, \fB\-R\fR,
and the script command language.  If \fIno\fR binary input files at all
are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the
message \fBNo input files\fR.
.PP
If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object file, it will
assume that it is a linker script.  A script specified in this way
augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default
linker script or the one specified by using \fB\-T\fR).  This feature
permits the linker to link against a file which appears to be an object
or an archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses
\&\f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`GROUP\*(C'\fR to load other objects.  Note that
specifying a script in this way merely augments the main linker script;
use the \fB\-T\fR option to replace the default linker script entirely.
.PP
For options whose names are a single letter,
option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening
whitespace, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the
option that requires them.
.PP
For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can
precede the option name; for example, \fB\-trace\-symbol\fR and
\&\fB\-\-trace\-symbol\fR are equivalent.  Note\-\-\-there is one exception to
this rule.  Multiple letter options that start with a lower case 'o' can
only be preceded by two dashes.  This is to reduce confusion with the
\&\fB\-o\fR option.  So for example \fB\-omagic\fR sets the output file
name to \fBmagic\fR whereas \fB\-\-omagic\fR sets the \s-1NMAGIC\s0 flag on the
output.
.PP
Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from the
option name by an equals sign, or be given as separate arguments
immediately following the option that requires them.  For example,
\&\fB\-\-trace\-symbol foo\fR and \fB\-\-trace\-symbol=foo\fR are equivalent.
Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are
accepted.
.PP
Note\-\-\-if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver
(e.g. \fBgcc\fR) then all the linker command line options should be
prefixed by \fB\-Wl,\fR (or whatever is appropriate for the particular
compiler driver) like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&          gcc \-Wl,\-\-startgroup foo.o bar.o \-Wl,\-\-endgroup
.Ve
.PP
This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver program may
silently drop the linker options, resulting in a bad link.
.PP
Here is a table of the generic command line switches accepted by the \s-1GNU\s0
linker:
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR\fIkeyword\fR" 4
.IX Item "-akeyword"
This option is supported for \s-1HP/UX\s0 compatibility.  The \fIkeyword\fR
argument must be one of the strings \fBarchive\fR, \fBshared\fR, or
\&\fBdefault\fR.  \fB\-aarchive\fR is functionally equivalent to
\&\fB\-Bstatic\fR, and the other two keywords are functionally equivalent
to \fB\-Bdynamic\fR.  This option may be used any number of times.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR\fIarchitecture\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Aarchitecture"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-architecture=\fR\fIarchitecture\fR" 4
.IX Item "--architecture=architecture"
.PD
In the current release of \fBld\fR, this option is useful only for the
Intel 960 family of architectures.  In that \fBld\fR configuration, the
\&\fIarchitecture\fR argument identifies the particular architecture in
the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the
archive-library search path.
.Sp
Future releases of \fBld\fR may support similar functionality for
other architecture families.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fIinput-format\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b input-format"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-format=\fR\fIinput-format\fR" 4
.IX Item "--format=input-format"
.PD
\&\fBld\fR may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file.  If your \fBld\fR is configured this way, you can use the
\&\fB\-b\fR option to specify the binary format for input object files
that follow this option on the command line.  Even when \fBld\fR is
configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need
to specify this, as \fBld\fR should be configured to expect as a
default input format the most usual format on each machine.
\&\fIinput-format\fR is a text string, the name of a particular format
supported by the \s-1BFD\s0 libraries.  (You can list the available binary
formats with \fBobjdump \-i\fR.)
.Sp
You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual
binary format.  You can also use \fB\-b\fR to switch formats explicitly (when
linking object files of different formats), by including
\&\fB\-b\fR \fIinput-format\fR before each group of object files in a
particular format.
.Sp
The default format is taken from the environment variable
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
You can also define the input format from a script, using the command
\&\f(CW\*(C`TARGET\*(C'\fR;
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIMRI-commandfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c MRI-commandfile"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-mri\-script=\fR\fIMRI-commandfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--mri-script=MRI-commandfile"
.PD
For compatibility with linkers produced by \s-1MRI\s0, \fBld\fR accepts script
files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described in
the \s-1MRI\s0 Compatible Script Files section of \s-1GNU\s0 ld documentation.
Introduce \s-1MRI\s0 script files with
the option \fB\-c\fR; use the \fB\-T\fR option to run linker
scripts written in the general-purpose \fBld\fR scripting language.
If \fIMRI-cmdfile\fR does not exist, \fBld\fR looks for it in the directories
specified by any \fB\-L\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-dc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dc"
.IP "\fB\-dp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dp"
.PD
These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for
compatibility with other linkers.  They assign space to common symbols
even if a relocatable output file is specified (with \fB\-r\fR).  The
script command \f(CW\*(C`FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION\*(C'\fR has the same effect.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIentry\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e entry"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-entry=\fR\fIentry\fR" 4
.IX Item "--entry=entry"
.PD
Use \fIentry\fR as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your
program, rather than the default entry point.  If there is no symbol
named \fIentry\fR, the linker will try to parse \fIentry\fR as a number,
and use that as the entry address (the number will be interpreted in
base 10; you may use a leading \fB0x\fR for base 16, or a leading
\&\fB0\fR for base 8).
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude\-libs\fR \fIlib\fR\fB,\fR\fIlib\fR\fB,...\fR" 4
.IX Item "--exclude-libs lib,lib,..."
Specifies a list of archive libraries from which symbols should not be automatically
exported. The library names may be delimited by commas or colons.  Specifying
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-exclude\-libs ALL\*(C'\fR excludes symbols in all archive libraries from
automatic export.  This option is available only for the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted
port of the linker and for \s-1ELF\s0 targeted ports.  For i386 \s-1PE\s0, symbols
explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported, regardless of this
option.  For \s-1ELF\s0 targeted ports, symbols affected by this option will
be treated as hidden.
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-export\-dynamic\fR" 4
.IX Item "--export-dynamic"
.PD
When creating a dynamically linked executable, add all symbols to the
dynamic symbol table.  The dynamic symbol table is the set of symbols
which are visible from dynamic objects at run time.
.Sp
If you do not use this option, the dynamic symbol table will normally
contain only those symbols which are referenced by some dynamic object
mentioned in the link.
.Sp
If you use \f(CW\*(C`dlopen\*(C'\fR to load a dynamic object which needs to refer
back to the symbols defined by the program, rather than some other
dynamic object, then you will probably need to use this option when
linking the program itself.
.Sp
You can also use the dynamic list to control what symbols should
be added to the dynamic symbol table if the output format supports it.
See the description of \fB\-\-dynamic\-list\fR.
.IP "\fB\-EB\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EB"
Link big-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.
.IP "\fB\-EL\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EL"
Link little-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-auxiliary\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--auxiliary name"
.PD
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 field
to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol
table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the
symbol table of the shared object \fIname\fR.
.Sp
If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 field.  If
the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter object, it will
first check whether there is a definition in the shared object
\&\fIname\fR.  If there is one, it will be used instead of the definition
in the filter object.  The shared object \fIname\fR need not exist.
Thus the shared object \fIname\fR may be used to provide an alternative
implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging or for
machine specific performance.
.Sp
This option may be specified more than once.  The \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 entries
will be created in the order in which they appear on the command line.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-F name"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-filter\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--filter name"
.PD
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_FILTER\s0 field to
the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table
of the shared object which is being created should be used as a filter
on the symbol table of the shared object \fIname\fR.
.Sp
If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the \s-1DT_FILTER\s0 field.  The
dynamic linker will resolve symbols according to the symbol table of the
filter object as usual, but it will actually link to the definitions
found in the shared object \fIname\fR.  Thus the filter object can be
used to select a subset of the symbols provided by the object
\&\fIname\fR.
.Sp
Some older linkers used the \fB\-F\fR option throughout a compilation
toolchain for specifying object-file format for both input and output
object files.
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker uses other mechanisms for this purpose: the
\&\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR, \fB\-\-oformat\fR options, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`TARGET\*(C'\fR command in linker scripts, and the \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR
environment variable.
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker will ignore the \fB\-F\fR option when not
creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object.
.IP "\fB\-fini\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fini name"
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 executable or shared object, call \s-1NAME\s0 when the
executable or shared object is unloaded, by setting \s-1DT_FINI\s0 to the
address of the function.  By default, the linker uses \f(CW\*(C`_fini\*(C'\fR as
the function to call.
.IP "\fB\-g\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g"
Ignored.  Provided for compatibility with other tools.
.IP "\fB\-G\fR\fIvalue\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Gvalue"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-gpsize=\fR\fIvalue\fR" 4
.IX Item "--gpsize=value"
.PD
Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the \s-1GP\s0 register to
\&\fIsize\fR.  This is only meaningful for object file formats such as
\&\s-1MIPS\s0 \s-1ECOFF\s0 which supports putting large and small objects into different
sections.  This is ignored for other object file formats.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-hname"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-soname=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-soname=name"
.PD
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 field to
the specified name.  When an executable is linked with a shared object
which has a \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 field, then when the executable is run the dynamic
linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the \s-1DT_SONAME\s0
field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i"
Perform an incremental link (same as option \fB\-r\fR).
.IP "\fB\-init\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-init name"
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 executable or shared object, call \s-1NAME\s0 when the
executable or shared object is loaded, by setting \s-1DT_INIT\s0 to the address
of the function.  By default, the linker uses \f(CW\*(C`_init\*(C'\fR as the
function to call.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR\fInamespec\fR" 4
.IX Item "-lnamespec"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-library=\fR\fInamespec\fR" 4
.IX Item "--library=namespec"
.PD
Add the archive or object file specified by \fInamespec\fR to the
list of files to link.  This option may be used any number of times.
If \fInamespec\fR is of the form \fI:\fIfilename\fI\fR, \fBld\fR
will search the library path for a file called \fIfilename\fR, otherise it
will search the library path for a file called \fIlib\fInamespec\fI.a\fR.
.Sp
On systems which support shared libraries, \fBld\fR may also search for
files other than \fIlib\fInamespec\fI.a\fR.  Specifically, on \s-1ELF\s0
and SunOS systems, \fBld\fR will search a directory for a library
called \fIlib\fInamespec\fI.so\fR before searching for one called
\&\fIlib\fInamespec\fI.a\fR.  (By convention, a \f(CW\*(C`.so\*(C'\fR extension
indicates a shared library.)  Note that this behavior does not apply
to \fI:\fIfilename\fI\fR, which always specifies a file called
\&\fIfilename\fR.
.Sp
The linker will search an archive only once, at the location where it is
specified on the command line.  If the archive defines a symbol which
was undefined in some object which appeared before the archive on the
command line, the linker will include the appropriate file(s) from the
archive.  However, an undefined symbol in an object appearing later on
the command line will not cause the linker to search the archive again.
.Sp
See the \fB\-(\fR option for a way to force the linker to search
archives multiple times.
.Sp
You may list the same archive multiple times on the command line.
.Sp
This type of archive searching is standard for Unix linkers.  However,
if you are using \fBld\fR on \s-1AIX\s0, note that it is different from the
behaviour of the \s-1AIX\s0 linker.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR\fIsearchdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Lsearchdir"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-library\-path=\fR\fIsearchdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "--library-path=searchdir"
.PD
Add path \fIsearchdir\fR to the list of paths that \fBld\fR will search
for archive libraries and \fBld\fR control scripts.  You may use this
option any number of times.  The directories are searched in the order
in which they are specified on the command line.  Directories specified
on the command line are searched before the default directories.  All
\&\fB\-L\fR options apply to all \fB\-l\fR options, regardless of the
order in which the options appear.
.Sp
If \fIsearchdir\fR begins with \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, then the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR will be replaced
by the \fIsysroot prefix\fR, a path specified when the linker is configured.
.Sp
The default set of paths searched (without being specified with
\&\fB\-L\fR) depends on which emulation mode \fBld\fR is using, and in
some cases also on how it was configured.
.Sp
The paths can also be specified in a link script with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`SEARCH_DIR\*(C'\fR command.  Directories specified this way are searched
at the point in which the linker script appears in the command line.

Emulate the \fIemulation\fR linker.  You can list the available

If the \fB\-m\fR option is not used, the emulation is taken from the

.IX Item "--print-map"
.PD
Print a link map to the standard output.  A link map provides
information about the link, including the following:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
Where object files are mapped into memory.
.IP "\(bu" 4
How common symbols are allocated.
.IP "\(bu" 4
All archive members included in the link, with a mention of the symbol
which caused the archive member to be brought in.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The values assigned to symbols.
.Sp
Note \- symbols whose values are computed by an expression which
involves a reference to a previous value of the same symbol may not
have correct result displayed in the link map.  This is because the
linker discards intermediate results and only retains the final value
of an expression.  Under such circumstances the linker will display
the final value enclosed by square brackets.  Thus for example a
linker script containing:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&           foo = 1
\&           foo = foo * 4
\&           foo = foo + 8
.Ve
.Sp
will produce the following output in the link map if the \fB\-M\fR
option is used:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&           0x00000001                foo = 0x1
\&           [0x0000000c]                foo = (foo * 0x4)

.IP "\fB\-\-no\-omagic\fR" 4

This option negates most of the effects of the \fB\-N\fR option.  It

linking\fR.  As a side effect, in environments that support standard Unix

turn serve as input to \fBld\fR.  When linking \*(C+ programs, \fB\-Ur\fR
\&\fIdoes\fR resolve references to constructors, unlike \fB\-r\fR.
It does not work to use \fB\-Ur\fR on files that were themselves linked
with \fB\-Ur\fR; once the constructor table has been built, it cannot
be added to.  Use \fB\-Ur\fR only for the last partial link, and

The specified archives are searched repeatedly until no new undefined

the order that it is specified on the command line.  If a symbol in that
archive is needed to resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an
object in an archive that appears later on the command line, the linker
would not be able to resolve that reference.  By grouping the archives,
they all be searched repeatedly until all possible references are
resolved.

Tells the linker to accept input files whose architecture cannot be

and deliberately wants to link in these unknown input files.  This was
the default behaviour of the linker, before release 2.14.  The default

global symbols whose references shouldn't be bound to the definition
within the shared library, or creating dynamically linked executables
to specify a list of symbols which should be added to the symbol table

Asks the linker \fInot\fR to check section addresses after they have
been assigned to see if there are any overlaps.  Normally the linker will
perform this check, and if it finds any overlaps it will produce
suitable error messages.  The linker does know about, and does make

restored by using the command line switch \fB\-\-check\-sections\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-cref\fR" 4
.IX Item "--cref"
Output a cross reference table.  If a linker map file is being
generated, the cross reference table is printed to the map file.
Otherwise, it is printed on the standard output.
.Sp
The format of the table is intentionally simple, so that it may be
easily processed by a script if necessary.  The symbols are printed out,
sorted by name.  For each symbol, a list of file names is given.  If the
symbol is defined, the first file listed is the location of the
definition.  The remaining files contain references to the symbol.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-define\-common\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-define-common"
This option inhibits the assignment of addresses to common symbols.
The script command \f(CW\*(C`INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION\*(C'\fR has the same effect.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-no\-define\-common\fR option allows decoupling
the decision to assign addresses to Common symbols from the choice
of the output file type; otherwise a non-Relocatable output type
forces assigning addresses to Common symbols.
Using \fB\-\-no\-define\-common\fR allows Common symbols that are referenced
from a shared library to be assigned addresses only in the main program.
This eliminates the unused duplicate space in the shared library,
and also prevents any possible confusion over resolving to the wrong
duplicate when there are many dynamic modules with specialized search
paths for runtime symbol resolution.

.PD
These options control whether to demangle symbol names in error messages
and other output.  When the linker is told to demangle, it tries to
present symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips leading
underscores if they are used by the object file format, and converts \*(C+
mangled symbol names into user readable names.  Different compilers have
different mangling styles.  The optional demangling style argument can be used
to choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.  The linker will
demangle by default unless the environment variable \fB\s-1COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\s0\fR

.Sp
If a successfully built fully linked output file does not have a

\&\fBld\fR normally optimizes for speed over memory usage by caching the

.PD
Allows (the default) or disallows undefined symbols in shared libraries.
This switch is similar to \fB\-\-no\-undefined\fR except that it
determines the behaviour when the undefined symbols are in a
shared library rather than a regular object file.  It does not affect
how undefined symbols in regular object files are handled.
.Sp
The reason that \fB\-\-allow\-shlib\-undefined\fR is the default is that
the shared library being specified at link time may not be the same as
the one that is available at load time, so the symbols might actually be
resolvable at load time.  Plus there are some systems, (eg BeOS) where
undefined symbols in shared libraries is normal.  (The kernel patches
them at load time to select which function is most appropriate
for the current architecture.  This is used for example to dynamically
select an appropriate memset function).  Apparently it is also normal
for \s-1HPPA\s0 shared libraries to have undefined symbols.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-undefined\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-undefined-version"
Normally when a symbol has an undefined version, the linker will ignore

Normally \fBld\fR will give an error if you try to link together input
files that are mismatched for some reason, perhaps because they have
been compiled for different processors or for different endiannesses.
This option tells \fBld\fR that it should silently permit such possible

inappropriate.

.IX Item "--oformat output-format"
\&\fBld\fR may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file.  If your \fBld\fR is configured this way, you can use the
\&\fB\-\-oformat\fR option to specify the binary format for the output
object file.  Even when \fBld\fR is configured to support alternative
object formats, you don't usually need to specify this, as \fBld\fR
should be configured to produce as a default output format the most
usual format on each machine.  \fIoutput-format\fR is a text string, the
name of a particular format supported by the \s-1BFD\s0 libraries.  (You can
list the available binary formats with \fBobjdump \-i\fR.)  The script
command \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT_FORMAT\*(C'\fR can also specify the output format, but
this option overrides it.

Create a position independent executable.  This is currently only supported on
\&\s-1ELF\s0 platforms.  Position independent executables are similar to shared
libraries in that they are relocated by the dynamic linker to the virtual
address the \s-1OS\s0 chooses for them (which can vary between invocations).  Like
normal dynamically linked executables they can be executed and symbols
defined in the executable cannot be overridden by shared libraries.

An option with machine dependent effects.
This option is only supported on a few targets.
.Sp
On some platforms, the \fB\-\-relax\fR option performs global
optimizations that become possible when the linker resolves addressing
in the program, such as relaxing address modes and synthesizing new
instructions in the output object file.
.Sp
On some platforms these link time global optimizations may make symbolic
debugging of the resulting executable impossible.
This is known to be
the case for the Matsushita \s-1MN10200\s0 and \s-1MN10300\s0 family of processors.
.Sp
On platforms where this is not supported, \fB\-\-relax\fR is accepted,
but ignored.

.IX Item "--retain-symbols-file filename"
Retain \fIonly\fR the symbols listed in the file \fIfilename\fR,
discarding all others.  \fIfilename\fR is simply a flat file, with one
symbol name per line.  This option is especially useful in environments
(such as VxWorks)
where a large global symbol table is accumulated gradually, to conserve
run-time memory.
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-retain\-symbols\-file\fR does \fInot\fR discard undefined symbols,
or symbols needed for relocations.

You may only specify \fB\-\-retain\-symbols\-file\fR once in the command
line.  It overrides \fB\-s\fR and \fB\-S\fR.
.IP "\fB\-rpath\fR \fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rpath dir"
Add a directory to the runtime library search path.  This is used when
linking an \s-1ELF\s0 executable with shared objects.  All \fB\-rpath\fR
arguments are concatenated and passed to the runtime linker, which uses
them to locate shared objects at runtime.  The \fB\-rpath\fR option is
also used when locating shared objects which are needed by shared
objects explicitly included in the link; see the description of the
\&\fB\-rpath\-link\fR option.  If \fB\-rpath\fR is not used when linking an
\&\s-1ELF\s0 executable, the contents of the environment variable
\&\f(CW\*(C`LD_RUN_PATH\*(C'\fR will be used if it is defined.
.Sp
The \fB\-rpath\fR option may also be used on SunOS.  By default, on
SunOS, the linker will form a runtime search patch out of all the
\&\fB\-L\fR options it is given.  If a \fB\-rpath\fR option is used, the
runtime search path will be formed exclusively using the \fB\-rpath\fR
options, ignoring the \fB\-L\fR options.  This can be useful when using
gcc, which adds many \fB\-L\fR options which may be on \s-1NFS\s0 mounted
file systems.
.Sp
For compatibility with other \s-1ELF\s0 linkers, if the \fB\-R\fR option is
followed by a directory name, rather than a file name, it is treated as
the \fB\-rpath\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-rpath\-link\fR \fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rpath-link DIR"
When using \s-1ELF\s0 or SunOS, one shared library may require another.  This
happens when an \f(CW\*(C`ld \-shared\*(C'\fR link includes a shared library as one
of the input files.
.Sp
When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a non-shared,
non-relocatable link, it will automatically try to locate the required
shared library and include it in the link, if it is not included
explicitly.  In such a case, the \fB\-rpath\-link\fR option
specifies the first set of directories to search.  The
\&\fB\-rpath\-link\fR option may specify a sequence of directory names
either by specifying a list of names separated by colons, or by
appearing multiple times.
.Sp
This option should be used with caution as it overrides the search path
that may have been hard compiled into a shared library. In such a case it
is possible to use unintentionally a different search path than the
runtime linker would do.
.Sp
The linker uses the following search paths to locate required shared
libraries:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
Any directories specified by \fB\-rpath\-link\fR options.
.IP "2." 4
Any directories specified by \fB\-rpath\fR options.  The difference
between \fB\-rpath\fR and \fB\-rpath\-link\fR is that directories
specified by \fB\-rpath\fR options are included in the executable and
used at runtime, whereas the \fB\-rpath\-link\fR option is only effective
at link time. Searching \fB\-rpath\fR in this way is only supported
by native linkers and cross linkers which have been configured with
the \fB\-\-with\-sysroot\fR option.
.IP "3." 4
On an \s-1ELF\s0 system, if the \fB\-rpath\fR and \f(CW\*(C`rpath\-link\*(C'\fR options
were not used, search the contents of the environment variable
\&\f(CW\*(C`LD_RUN_PATH\*(C'\fR. It is for the native linker only.
.IP "4." 4
On SunOS, if the \fB\-rpath\fR option was not used, search any

For a native linker, the contents of the environment variable
\&\f(CW\*(C`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\*(C'\fR.

libraries needed by it. The \f(CW\*(C`DT_RPATH\*(C'\fR entries are ignored if
\&\f(CW\*(C`DT_RUNPATH\*(C'\fR entries exist.

This is useful when generating huge relocatable files for downloading into
certain real time kernels with the \s-1COFF\s0 object file format; since \s-1COFF\s0
cannot represent more than 65535 relocations in a single section.  Note
that this will fail to work with object file formats which do not
support arbitrary sections.  The linker will not split up individual
input sections for redistribution, so if a single input section contains
more than \fIcount\fR relocations one output section will contain that
many relocations.  \fIcount\fR defaults to a value of 32768.

full debugging information by over 30 percent.  Unfortunately, the SunOS

Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or with

you to find potential problems from combining global symbols.
Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practise, so you may get some

There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated here by C examples:
.RS 4

A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output

An undefined reference, which does not allocate space.
There must be either a definition or a common symbol for the
variable somewhere.
.IP "\fBint i;\fR" 4
.IX Item "int i;"
A common symbol.  If there are only (one or more) common symbols for a
variable, it goes in the uninitialized data area of the output file.
The linker merges multiple common symbols for the same variable into a
single symbol.  If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest
size.  The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if there is
a definition of the same variable.

detect the use of global constructors.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-multiple\-gp\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-multiple-gp"
Warn if multiple global pointer values are required in the output file.
This is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha.
Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special
section.  A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle
of this section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a
base-register relative addressing mode.  Since the offset in
base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16
bits), this limits the maximum size of the constant pool.  Thus, in
large programs, it is often necessary to use multiple global pointer
values in order to be able to address all possible constants.  This
option causes a warning to be issued whenever this case occurs.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-once\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-once"
Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once per module
which refers to it.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-section\-align\fR" 4

the section.

library, forcing every object to be included in the resulting shared
library.  This option may be used more than once.
.Sp
Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc doesn't know
about this option, so you have to use \fB\-Wl,\-whole\-archive\fR.
Second, don't forget to use \fB\-Wl,\-no\-whole\-archive\fR after your
list of archives, because gcc will add its own list of archives to
your link and you may not want this flag to affect those as well.
.IP "\fB\-\-wrap\fR \fIsymbol\fR" 4
.IX Item "--wrap symbol"
Use a wrapper function for \fIsymbol\fR.  Any undefined reference to
\&\fIsymbol\fR will be resolved to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR.  Any

This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system function.  The
wrapper function should be called \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR.  If it

.Vb 6
\&        void *
\&        _\|_wrap_malloc (size_t c)
\&        {
\&          printf ("malloc called with %zu\en", c);
\&          return _\|_real_malloc (c);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
If you link other code with this file using \fB\-\-wrap malloc\fR, then
all calls to \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR will call the function \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR
instead.  The call to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR will
call the real \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR function.
.Sp
You may wish to provide a \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR function as well, so that
links without the \fB\-\-wrap\fR option will succeed.  If you do this,
you should not put the definition of \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR in the same
file as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR; if you do, the assembler may resolve the
call before the linker has a chance to wrap it to \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR.

This linker can create the new dynamic tags in \s-1ELF\s0. But the older \s-1ELF\s0
systems may not understand them. If you specify
\&\fB\-\-enable\-new\-dtags\fR, the dynamic tags will be created as needed.
If you specify \fB\-\-disable\-new\-dtags\fR, no new dynamic tags will be
created. By default, the new dynamic tags are not created. Note that
those options are only available for \s-1ELF\s0 systems.
.IP "\fB\-\-hash\-size=\fR\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "--hash-size=number"
Set the default size of the linker's hash tables to a prime number
close to \fInumber\fR.  Increasing this value can reduce the length of
time it takes the linker to perform its tasks, at the expense of
increasing the linker's memory requirements.  Similarly reducing this
value can reduce the memory requirements at the expense of speed.
.IP "\fB\-\-hash\-style=\fR\fIstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "--hash-style=style"
Set the type of linker's hash table(s).  \fIstyle\fR can be either
\&\f(CW\*(C`sysv\*(C'\fR for classic \s-1ELF\s0 \f(CW\*(C`.hash\*(C'\fR section, \f(CW\*(C`gnu\*(C'\fR for
new style \s-1GNU\s0 \f(CW\*(C`.gnu.hash\*(C'\fR section or \f(CW\*(C`both\*(C'\fR for both
the classic \s-1ELF\s0 \f(CW\*(C`.hash\*(C'\fR and new style \s-1GNU\s0 \f(CW\*(C`.gnu.hash\*(C'\fR
hash tables.  The default is \f(CW\*(C`sysv\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-reduce\-memory\-overheads\fR" 4
.IX Item "--reduce-memory-overheads"
This option reduces memory requirements at ld runtime, at the expense of
linking speed.  This was introduced to select the old O(n^2) algorithm
for link map file generation, rather than the new O(n) algorithm which uses
about 40% more memory for symbol storage.
.Sp
Another effect of the switch is to set the default hash table size to
1021, which again saves memory at the cost of lengthening the linker's
run time.  This is not done however if the \fB\-\-hash\-size\fR switch
has been used.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-reduce\-memory\-overheads\fR switch may be also be used to
enable other tradeoffs in future versions of the linker.
.PP
The i386 \s-1PE\s0 linker supports the \fB\-shared\fR option, which causes
the output to be a dynamically linked library (\s-1DLL\s0) instead of a
normal executable.  You should name the output \f(CW\*(C`*.dll\*(C'\fR when you
use this option.  In addition, the linker fully supports the standard
\&\f(CW\*(C`*.def\*(C'\fR files, which may be specified on the linker command line
like an object file (in fact, it should precede archives it exports
symbols from, to ensure that they get linked in, just like a normal
object file).
.PP
In addition to the options common to all targets, the i386 \s-1PE\s0 linker
support additional command line options that are specific to the i386

.IP "\fB\-\-dll\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dll"
Create a \s-1DLL\s0 instead of a regular executable.  You may also use

.PD
If the link finds a symbol that it cannot resolve, it will attempt to
do \*(L"fuzzy linking\*(R" by looking for another defined symbol that differs
only in the format of the symbol name (cdecl vs stdcall) and will
resolve that symbol by linking to the match.  For example, the
undefined symbol \f(CW\*(C`_foo\*(C'\fR might be linked to the function
\&\f(CW\*(C`_foo@12\*(C'\fR, or the undefined symbol \f(CW\*(C`_bar@16\*(C'\fR might be linked
to the function \f(CW\*(C`_bar\*(C'\fR.  When the linker does this, it prints a
warning, since it normally should have failed to link, but sometimes
import libraries generated from third-party dlls may need this feature
to be usable.  If you specify \fB\-\-enable\-stdcall\-fixup\fR, this
feature is fully enabled and warnings are not printed.  If you specify
\&\fB\-\-disable\-stdcall\-fixup\fR, this feature is disabled and such
mismatches are considered to be errors.

.IP "\fB\-\-export\-all\-symbols\fR" 4
.IX Item "--export-all-symbols"
If given, all global symbols in the objects used to build a \s-1DLL\s0 will
be exported by the \s-1DLL\s0.  Note that this is the default if there
otherwise wouldn't be any exported symbols.  When symbols are
explicitly exported via \s-1DEF\s0 files or implicitly exported via function
attributes, the default is to not export anything else unless this
option is given.  Note that the symbols \f(CW\*(C`DllMain@12\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`DllEntryPoint@0\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`DllMainCRTStartup@12\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`impure_ptr\*(C'\fR will not be automatically
exported.  Also, symbols imported from other DLLs will not be
re-exported, nor will symbols specifying the \s-1DLL\s0's internal layout
such as those beginning with \f(CW\*(C`_head_\*(C'\fR or ending with
\&\f(CW\*(C`_iname\*(C'\fR.  In addition, no symbols from \f(CW\*(C`libgcc\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`libstd++\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`libmingw32\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`crtX.o\*(C'\fR will be exported.
Symbols whose names begin with \f(CW\*(C`_\|_rtti_\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_\*(C'\fR will
not be exported, to help with \*(C+ DLLs.  Finally, there is an
extensive list of cygwin-private symbols that are not exported
(obviously, this applies on when building DLLs for cygwin targets).
These cygwin-excludes are: \f(CW\*(C`_cygwin_dll_entry@12\*(C'\fR,

Do sophisticated linking of \f(CW\*(C`_symbol\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_imp_\|_symbol\*(C'\fR for
\&\s-1DATA\s0 imports from DLLs, and create the necessary thunking symbols when
building the import libraries with those \s-1DATA\s0 exports. Note: Use of the
\&'auto\-import' extension will cause the text section of the image file
to be made writable. This does not conform to the PE-COFF format
specification published by Microsoft.
.Sp
Using 'auto\-import' generally will 'just work' \*(-- but sometimes you may
see this message:
.Sp
"variable '<var>' can't be auto-imported. Please read the
documentation for ld's \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-auto\-import\*(C'\fR for details."
.Sp
This message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses an address
ultimately given by the sum of two constants (Win32 import tables only
allow one).  Instances where this may occur include accesses to member 
fields of struct variables imported from a \s-1DLL\s0, as well as using a 
constant index into an array variable imported from a \s-1DLL\s0.  Any 
multiword variable (arrays, structs, long long, etc) may trigger
this error condition.  However, regardless of the exact data type
of the offending exported variable, ld will always detect it, issue
the warning, and exit.
.Sp
There are several ways to address this difficulty, regardless of the
data type of the exported variable:
.Sp
One way is to use \-\-enable\-runtime\-pseudo\-reloc switch. This leaves the task
of adjusting references in your client code for runtime environment, so
this method works only when runtime environment supports this feature.
.Sp
A second solution is to force one of the 'constants' to be a variable \*(-- 
that is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile time.  For arrays, 
there are two possibilities: a) make the indexee (the array's address) 
a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a variable.  Thus:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern type extern_array[];
\&        extern_array[1] \-\-> 
\&           { volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern type extern_array[];
\&        extern_array[1] \-\-> 
\&           { volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }
.Ve
.Sp
For structs (and most other multiword data types) the only option 
is to make the struct itself (or the long long, or the ...) variable:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern struct s extern_struct;
\&        extern_struct.field \-\-> 
\&           { volatile struct s *t=&extern_struct; t\->field }
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern long long extern_ll;
\&        extern_ll \-\->
\&          { volatile long long * local_ll=&extern_ll; *local_ll }
.Ve
.Sp
A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to abandon
\&'auto\-import' for the offending symbol and mark it with 
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_declspec(dllimport)\*(C'\fR.  However, in practise that
requires using compile-time #defines to indicate whether you are
building a \s-1DLL\s0, building client code that will link to the \s-1DLL\s0, or 
merely building/linking to a static library.   In making the choice 
between the various methods of resolving the 'direct address with 
constant offset' problem, you should consider typical real-world usage:
.Sp

.Sp
A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your 
library to use a functional interface rather than a data interface
for the offending variables (e.g. \fIset_foo()\fR and \fIget_foo()\fR accessor
functions).

You can change the behaviour of \fBld\fR with the environment variables
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR determines the input-file object format if you don't
use \fB\-b\fR (or its synonym \fB\-\-format\fR).  Its value should be one
of the \s-1BFD\s0 names for an input format.  If there is no
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR in the environment, \fBld\fR uses the natural format
of the target. If \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR then \s-1BFD\s0
attempts to discover the input format by examining binary input files;
this method often succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities, since
there is no method of ensuring that the magic number used to specify
object-file formats is unique.  However, the configuration procedure for
\&\s-1BFD\s0 on each system places the conventional format for that system first
in the search-list, so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR determines the default emulation if you don't use the
\&\fB\-m\fR option.  The emulation can affect various aspects of linker
behaviour, particularly the default linker script.  You can list the
available emulations with the \fB\-\-verbose\fR or \fB\-V\fR options.  If
the \fB\-m\fR option is not used, and the \f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR environment
variable is not defined, the default emulation depends upon how the
linker was configured.
.PP
Normally, the linker will default to demangling symbols.  However, if
\&\f(CW\*(C`COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\*(C'\fR is set in the environment, then it will
default to not demangling symbols.  This environment variable is used in
a similar fashion by the \f(CW\*(C`gcc\*(C'\fR linker wrapper program.  The default
may be overridden by the \fB\-\-demangle\fR and \fB\-\-no\-demangle\fR
options.
