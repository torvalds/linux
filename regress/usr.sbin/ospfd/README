This is a test framework for the ospfd routing daemon.  For each
test one fresh daemon is started with an individual config.  It is
talking OSPF via a tap interface.  At the process side of the tap
device a client is running.  This test programm is parsing the OSPF
packets and generates new ones.  It simulates other OSPF daemons.

For now only hello packets are tested.  Each test has a task list
which drives the ospfd through its interface state machine.  The
plan is to extend the framework for the other OSPF packet types and
state machines.  Eventualy the generated kernel routing messages
could also be checked.
