Regression tests for pf tcp state.

The test suite runs on the machine LOCAL, the kernel under test is
running on REMOTE.  On LOCAL a Scapy program is simulating a
connection to REMOTE TCP echo service.  The source address is a non
existing address on FAKE_NET.  The LOCAL machine acts as a router
between REMOTE and virtual FAKE_NET_ADDR and can create ICMP packets.

- run-challenge_ack subtest checks that the pf firewall sends TCP
  challenge ACK if the sequence number is out of range.
- run-beforegap_rst sends TCP stream with a gap.  Then a TCP reset
  packet that matches the ACK before a sequence gap should terminate
  the connection.
- run-lessseq_fin sends TCP FIN packet that is not at the end of
  the sequence.
- run-negack_fin send TCP FIN packet that uses ack number that was
  never sent before.  Packet is accepted although below range.
- run-posack_fin sends TCP FIN packet that uses acknowledge number
  that has not been sent yet.

EXAMPLE

To run this test I use the following configuration files.
You should choose a different set of MAC and IP addresses.

- My local machine where I run the regression test:

/etc/hosts
# to login to qemu with SSH via IPv6 link-local
fe80::725f:caff:fe21:8d70%tap0		q70

cat /etc/hostname.tap4

- Fix your configuration until make check-setup passes
