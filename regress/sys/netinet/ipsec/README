Send IPsec traffic to another machine where it gets processed.
There the IPsec implementation has to deliver it to the local stack
or forward it after decryption.  By reflecting the packets, the way
back is also tested.  When the response is received at the generating
machine, the test is considered successful.

Currently ICMP ping, UDP, TCP packets are protected with ESP and
AH.  Also IPIP encapsulation and IP compression flows are tested.
Transport and tunnel mode are tested with all combinations of IPv4
and IPv6.  SA bundles that do IPComp, ESP, AH with a single flow
are tested with all combinations of encapsulation mode, and both
ip versions, and the ip protocols ping, UDP, TCP.  Small and big
ping packets are used, as IPComp skips small packets.

The netstat -s counters are checked to ensure that encrypted packets
are processed in both ways.

The BPF output of the enc0 and pflog0 interface is checked.  This
ensures that all IPsec packets are passed to bpf and pf.

TODO:
Tests for fragments and path MTU discovery are planned.
Test TCP MD5 signatures.
Test NAT-Traversal over UDP.
