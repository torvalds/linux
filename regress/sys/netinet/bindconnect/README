Stress test bind(2) and connect(2) system calls in OpenBSD regress.

bindconnect [-r] [-b bind] [-c connect] [-d delroute] [-f family] [-N addr/net]
[-n num] [-o close] [-p proto] [-s socket] [-t time]
    -b bind      threads binding sockets, default 1
    -c connect   threads connecting sockets, default 1
    -d delroute  threads deleting cloned routes, default 0
    -f family    address family inet or inet6, default inet
    -N addr/net  connect to any address within network
    -n num       number of file descriptors, default 128
    -o close     threads closing sockets, default 1
    -p proto     protocol udp, tcp, name or number, default udp
    -r           set reuse port socket option
    -s socket    threads creating sockets, default 1
    -t time      run time in seconds, default 10

Separate threads are started to run socket(2), close(2), bind(2),
and connect(2) system calls concurrently.  The number of sockets
is controlled by the process limit of open file descriptors.  All
system calls operate on random file descriptors.  By setting the
number of threads for each system call and the number of available
file descriptors, the focus for the stress test can be changed.

Currently IPv4 and IPv6 UDP sockets are supported.  Per default the
address to bind and connect is 127.0.0.1 or ::1.  LOCAL_NET or
LOCAL_NET6 environment variable allows to bind on a local address
and connect to all directly attached hosts.  This triggers creation
of cloned routes during source address selection.  To stress test
routing table, these routes can be deleted in another thread.
