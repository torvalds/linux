These regress tests use a local and remote machine.  On remote
machine inetd is providing services.  Local machine runs scapy to
navigate the remote TCP stack through the TCP state diagram.
For active connections a perl client is started on remote machine.

tcp_closing	FIN packets are retransmitted in CLOSING state.
tcp_established	data packets are retransmitted in ESTABLISHED state.
tcp_finwait	FIN retransmitted in FIN_WAIT_1 and goto FIN_WAIT_2 state.
tcp_lastack	FIN packets are retransmitted in LAST_ACK state.
tcp_syncache	SYN+ACK packets are retransmitted by SYN cache.
tcp_synrcvd	SYN+ACK retransmitted in SYN_RCVD after SYN_SENT state.
tcp_synsent	SYN packets are retransmitted in SYN_SENT state.
tcp_synfin	FIN retransmitted after SYN_SENT via SYN_RCVD to FIN_WAIT_1
