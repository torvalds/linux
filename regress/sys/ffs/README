These tests must be run as root, on a system with free vnd0 and vnd1 slots.
The system must be single-user or set to a securelevel < 1 for all tests to
pass.
It is also advised that /mnt be unmounted, and clean.
The NFS tests create an entry in /etc/exports and start NFS server
daemons for a loopback mount.
