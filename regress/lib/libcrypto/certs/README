This directory contains tools for building certificate chains to
test verification. Each subdirectory contains a set of certificates
that test a particular scenario. The root certificate(s) are contained
in a roots.pem file, while the leaf certificate and any untrusted
intermediate certificates are contained in a bundle.pem file.

 1a. A leaf certificate signed by the root certificate with no
     intermediates (should verify).

 2a. A leaf certificate signed by an intermediate, which is signed
     by a root certificate (should verify).

 2b. Same as (2a), however the intermediate is missing which should
     prevent verification.
 
 2c. Same as (2a), however the intermediate and root are in the intermediate
     bundle, (should verify)

 3a. A leaf certificate signed by three intermediates, the last of
     which is signed by a root certificate (should verify).

 3b. Same as (3a) however the first intermediate is missing which should
     prevent verification.

 3c. Same as (3a) however the second intermediate is missing which should
     prevent verification.

 3d. Same as (3a) however the third intermediate is missing which should
     prevent verification.

 3e. Same as (3a) however the order of the intermediates is reversed
     (should verify).

 4a. A leaf certificate signed by an intermediate, that is cross
     signed by two root certificates (should verify with two chains).

 4b. Same as (4a) but with one root missing (should verify with one chain).

 4c. Same as (4b) but with the other root missing (should verify with one
     chain).

 4d. Same as (4a) but with one intermediate missing (should verify with one
     chain).

 4e. Same as (4d) but with the other intermediate missing (should verify
     with one chain).

 4f. Same as (4a) but with the intermediates reversed (should verify with
     two chains).

 4g. Same as (4b) but with the intermediates reversed (should verify with
     one chain).

 4h. Same as (4c) but with the intermediates reversed (should verify with
     one chain).

 5a. A leaf certificate signed by an intermediate, that is cross
     signed by one root certificate and an intermediate, which in turn
     is signed by a second root (should verify with two chains).

 5b. Same as (5a) but missing the first root certificate (should verify
     with one chain).

 5c. Same as (5a) but missing the second root certificate (should verify
     with one chain).

 5d. Same as (5a) but missing the first intermediate (should verify with
     one chain).

 5e. Same as (5a) but missing the second intermediate (should verify
     with one chain).

 5f. Same as (5a) but missing the cross-signed intermediate (should verify
     with one chain).

 5g. Same as (5a) but order of intermediates is reversed (should verify
     with two chains).

 5h. Same as (5g) but missing the first root certificate (should verify
     with two chains).

 5i. Same as (5g) but missing the second root certificate (should verify
     with two chains).

 6a. A leaf certificate signed by an intermediate, that is cross
     signed by an expired root certificate and an intermediate, which
     in turn is signed by a second root (should verify with one chain).

 6b. Same as (6a) but the order of the intermediates is reversed (should
     verify with one chain).

 7a. A leaf certificate signed by an intermediate, that is cross
     signed by a root certificate and an intermediate, which in turn
     is signed by a second root that has expired (should verify with one
     chain).

 7b. Same as (7a) but the order of the intermediates is reversed (should
     verify with one chain).

 8a. An expired leaf certificate signed by an intermediate that is then
     signed by a root certificate (should fail to verify).

 9a. A leaf certificate signed by an expired intermediate, which is
     signed by a root certificate (should fail to verify).

10a. A leaf certificate signed by an intermediate, that is cross
     signed by two root certificates, with one of the cross signings
     having expired (should verify with one chain).

10b. Same as (10a) but order of intermediates is reversed (should verify
     with one chain.

11a. A leaf certificate signed by an intermediate, that is cross
     signed by one root certificate and an expired intermediate, which
     in turn is signed by a second root (should verify with one chain).

11b. Same as (11a) but order of intermediates is reversed (should verify
     with one chain.

12a. A leaf certificate signed by an intermediate, that is signed by a
     root certificate and cross signed as an expired intermediate, by a
     second root (should verify with one chain).

13a. A leaf certificate signed by an intermediate, that is signed by an
     expired root certificate and cross signed as an intermediate, by a
     second root (should verify with one chain).
