C MP+polocks

(*
 * Result: Never
 *
 * This litmus test demonstrates how lock acquisitions and releases can
 * stand in for smp_load_acquire() and smp_store_release(), respectively.
 * In other words, when holding a given lock (or indeed after releasing a
 * given lock), a CPU is not only guaranteed to see the accesses that other
 * CPUs made while previously holding that lock, it is also guaranteed
 * to see all prior accesses by those other CPUs.
