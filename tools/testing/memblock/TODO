TODO
=====

1. Add verbose output (e.g., what is being tested and how many tests cases are
   passing)

2. Add flags to Makefile:
   + verbosity level
   + enable memblock_dbg() messages (i.e. pass "-D CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMORY_INIT"
     flag)

3. Add tests trying to memblock_add() or memblock_reserve() 129th region.
   This will trigger memblock_double_array(), make sure it succeeds.
   *Important:* These tests require valid memory ranges, use dummy physical
                memory block from common.c to implement them. It is also very
                likely that the current MEM_SIZE won't be enough for these
                test cases. Use realloc to adjust the size accordingly.

4. Add test cases using this functions (implement them for both directions):
   + memblock_alloc_raw()
   + memblock_alloc_exact_nid_raw()
   + memblock_alloc_try_nid_raw()

5. Add tests for memblock_alloc_node() to check if the correct NUMA node is set
   for the new region

6. Update comments in tests/basic_api.c to match the style used in
   tests/alloc_*.c
