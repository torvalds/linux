       The kernel subsystem API documentation generation framework.
      --------------------------------------------------------------

For every Doxyfile-(.*) the Makefile adds the public targets $1, pdf-$1 and
clean-$1. For e.g. Doxyfile-dev_pci this translates to the targets dev_pci,
pdf-dev_pci and clean-dev_pci.

Additionally, the targets 'all', 'pdf-all' and 'clean' to generate or remove
the documentation for all targets are available.

The file 'Dependencies' contains dependencies for the .tag files.

To add another part to the documentation just copy a Doxyfile and add
the necessary dependencies to the file 'Dependencies'.

The following environment variables can be used in the Doxyfile:
 - DOXYGEN_SRC_PATH		(/usr/src/sys)
 - DOXYGEN_DEST_PATH		(where the docs are generated)
 - DOXYGEN_TARGET_ARCH		(${TARGET_ARCH} if set, else ${MACHINE_ARCH})

For the PDF generation you may have to change some limits in the latex
configuration (the build may fail and an error about e.g. "pool size" is
shown), for print/teTeX this is done in
	/usr/local/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

Programs needed to generate the API docs:
 - devel/doxygen
 - print/teTeX
 - graphics/graphviz
