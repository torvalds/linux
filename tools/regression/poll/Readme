$FreeBSD$

The directory contains poll(2) and select(2) compliance (and more) tests
from Bruce Evans, together with canned test results from several systems
for reference.

Citing Bruce Evans:
The subdirectories contain results of old runs:

{4,7}: FreeBSD-{4,7} with old tests (only state 0 and 6b have different
expectations; state 0 fails in FreeBSD-4 so the above is wrong
about at least when it was broken.  I thought that I fixed it
completely for select() in FreeBSD-1.  One or both of these states
were very broken in Net/2 and maybe in 4.4BSD-Lite*).

l: Linux-2.6.10 with old tests (only state 0 has different expectations)
m: my current version of FreeBSD with old tests (0 and 6b)
n: my previous version of FreeBSD with old tests (0 and 6b)
