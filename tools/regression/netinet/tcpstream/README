tcpstream - a simple TCP streaming test tool
--------------------------------------------

tcpstream generates TCP connections between a 'client' and a 'server'.  The
client writes a pseudo-random byte stream using varying write sizes.  The
server then reads the stream and uses the same generator to confirm that the
data is correct.  To run tcpstream, select a seed value (should be the same
for the client and server), and a port number (also the same for client and
server).  Typical use might be:

Run the server on port 8080 and use a seed of 100:

    tcpstream server 8080 100

Now run the client on a second machine with the server's IP, port 8080, and
seed of 100:

    tcpstream client 192.168.10.10 8080 100
