kvm_stat(1)
===========

NAME
----
kvm_stat - Report KVM kernel module event counters

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'kvm_stat' [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
kvm_stat prints counts of KVM kernel module trace events.  These events signify
state transitions such as guest mode entry and exit.

This tool is useful for observing guest behavior from the host perspective.
Often conclusions about performance or buggy behavior can be drawn from the
output.

The set of KVM kernel module trace events may be specific to the kernel version
or architecture.  It is best to check the KVM kernel module source code for the
meaning of events.

Note that trace events are counted globally across all running guests.
