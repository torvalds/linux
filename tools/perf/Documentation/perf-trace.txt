perf-trace(1)
=============

NAME
----
perf-trace - strace inspired tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'perf trace'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command will show the events associated with the target, initially
syscalls, but other system events like pagefaults, task lifetime events,
scheduling events, etc.

Initially this is a live mode only tool, but eventually will work with
perf.data files like the other tools, allowing a detached 'record' from
analysis phases.

OPTIONS
-------

-a::
--all-cpus::
        System-wide collection from all CPUs.

-e::
--expr::
	List of events to show, currently only syscall names.
	Prefixing with ! shows all syscalls but the ones specified.  You may
	need to escape it.

-o::
--output=::
	Output file name.

-p::
--pid=::
	Record events on existing process ID (comma separated list).

-t::
--tid=::
        Record events on existing thread ID (comma separated list).

-u::
--uid=::
        Record events in threads owned by uid. Name or number.

-v::
--verbose=::
        Verbosity level.

-i::
--no-inherit::
	Child tasks do not inherit counters.

-m::
--mmap-pages=::
	Number of mmap data pages (must be a power of two) or size
	specification with appended unit character - B/K/M/G. The
	size is rounded up to have nearest pages power of two value.

-C::
--cpu::
Collect samples only on the list of CPUs provided. Multiple CPUs can be provided as a
comma-separated list with no space: 0,1. Ranges of CPUs are specified with -: 0-2.
In per-thread mode with inheritance mode on (default), Events are captured only when
the thread executes on the designated CPUs. Default is to monitor all CPUs.

--duration:
	Show only events that had a duration greater than N.M ms.

--sched:
	Accrue thread runtime and provide a summary at the end of the session.

-i
--input
	Process events from a given perf data file.

-T
--time
	Print full timestamp rather time relative to first sample.

--comm::
        Show process COMM right beside its ID, on by default, disable with --no-comm.
