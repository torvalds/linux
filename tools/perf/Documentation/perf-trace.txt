perf-trace(1)
==============

NAME
----
perf-trace - Read perf.data (created by perf record) and display trace output

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'perf trace' {record <script> | report <script> [args] }

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command reads the input file and displays the trace recorded.

There are several variants of perf trace:

  'perf trace' to see a detailed trace of the workload that was
  recorded.

  You can also run a set of pre-canned scripts that aggregate and
  summarize the raw trace data in various ways (the list of scripts is
  available via 'perf trace -l').  The following variants allow you to
  record and run those scripts:

  'perf trace record <script>' to record the events required for 'perf
  trace report'.  <script> is the name displayed in the output of
  'perf trace --list' i.e. the actual script name minus any language
  extension.

  'perf trace report <script>' to run and display the results of
  <script>.  <script> is the name displayed in the output of 'perf
  trace --list' i.e. the actual script name minus any language
  extension.  The perf.data output from a previous run of 'perf trace
  record <script>' is used and should be present for this command to
  succeed.

  See the 'SEE ALSO' section for links to language-specific
  information on how to write and run your own trace scripts.
