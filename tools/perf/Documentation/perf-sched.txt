==============

NAME
----
perf-sched - Tool to trace/measure scheduler properties (latencies)

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'perf sched' {record|latency|replay|trace}

DESCRIPTION
-----------
There's four variants of perf sched:

  'perf sched record <command>' to record the scheduling events
  of an arbitrary workload.

  'perf sched latency' to report the per task scheduling latencies
  and other scheduling properties of the workload.

  'perf sched trace' to see a detailed trace of the workload that
  was recorded.

  'perf sched replay' to simulate the workload that was recorded
  via perf sched record. (this is done by starting up mockup threads
  that mimic the workload based on the events in the trace. These
  threads can then replay the timings (CPU runtime and sleep patterns)
  of the workload as it occured when it was recorded - and can repeat
  it a number of times, measuring its performance.)

OPTIONS
-------

--dump-raw-trace=::
