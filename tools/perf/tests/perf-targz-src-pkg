# Test one of the main kernel Makefile targets to generate a perf sources tarball
# suitable for build outside the full kernel sources.
#
# This is to test that the tools/perf/MANIFEST file lists all the files needed to
# be in such tarball, which sometimes gets broken when we move files around,
# like when we made some files that were in tools/perf/ available to other tools/
# codebases by moving it to tools/include/, etc.
