All instructions \"older\" than this one will be allowed to finish.  This instruction and all \"younger\" instructions must be cleared, since they must not be allowed to complete.  Essentially, the hardware waits until the problematic instruction is the oldest instruction in the machine.  This means all older instructions are retired, and all pending stores (from older instructions) are completed.  Then the new path of instructions from the front end are allowed to start into the machine.  There are many conditions that might cause a machine clear (including the receipt of an interrupt, or a trap or a fault).  All those conditions (including but not limited to MACHINE_CLEARS.MEMORY_ORDERING, MACHINE_CLEARS.SMC, and MACHINE_CLEARS.FP_ASSIST) are captured in the ANY event.

This event can be used to identify if the machine is truly front-end bound.  When this event occurs, it is an indication that the front-end of the machine is operating at less than its theoretical peak performance.  Background: We can think of the processor pipeline as being divided into 2 broader parts: Front-end and Back-end. Front-end is responsible for fetching the instruction, decoding into micro-ops (uops) in machine understandable format and putting them into a micro-op queue to be consumed by back end. The back-end then takes these micro-ops, allocates the required resources.  When all resources are ready, micro-ops are executed. If the back-end is not ready to accept micro-ops from the front-end, then we do not want to count these as front-end bottlenecks.  However, whenever we have bottlenecks in the back-end, we will have allocation unit stalls and eventually forcing the front-end to wait until the back-end is ready to receive more UOPS. This event counts the cycles only when back-end is requesting more uops and front-end is not able to provide them. Some examples of conditions that cause front-end efficiencies are: Icache misses, ITLB misses, and decoder restrictions that limit the front-end bandwidth.",

Most instructions are composed of one or two micro-ops. Some instructions are decoded into longer sequences such as repeat instructions, floating point transcendental instructions, and assists. In some cases micro-op sequences are fused or whole instructions are fused into one micro-op. See other UOPS_RETIRED events for differentiating retired fused and non-fused micro-ops.",
