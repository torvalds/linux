The most common case that this counts is when a micro-coded instruction is encountered by the front end of the machine.  Other cases include when an instruction encounters a fault, trap, or microcode assist of any sort.  The event will count MSROM startups for UOPS that are speculative, and subsequently cleared by branch mispredict or machine clear.  Background: UOPS are produced by two mechanisms.  Either they are generated by hardware that decodes instructions into UOPS, or they are delivered by a ROM (called the MSROM) that holds UOPS associated with a specific instruction.  MSROM UOPS might also be delivered in response to some condition such as a fault or other exceptional condition.  This event is an excellent mechanism for detecting instructions that require the use of MSROM instructions.",
