MM is placed before Instruction Decode Queue (IDQ) to merge uops being fed from the MITE and Decode Stream Buffer (DSB) paths. Decode Stream Buffer (DSB) inserts the Sync-indication whenever a Decode Stream Buffer (DSB)-to-MITE switch occurs.Penalty: A Decode Stream Buffer (DSB) hit followed by a Decode Stream Buffer (DSB) miss can cost up to six cycles in which no uops are delivered to the IDQ.
