The counter update is done at a lower clock rate then the core clock the overflow status bit for this counter may appear 'sticky'.  After the counter has overflowed and software clears the overflow status bit and resets the counter to less than MAX. The reset value to the counter is not clocked immediately so the overflow status bit will flip 'high (1)' and generate another PMI (if enabled) after which the reset value gets clocked into the counter. Therefore, software will get the interrupt, read the overflow status bit '1 for bit 34 while the counter value is less than MAX. Software should ignore this case.",

Only issue slots wasted due to fast nukes such as memory ordering nukes are counted. Other nukes are not accounted for. Counts all issue slots blocked during this recovery window, including relevant microcode flows, and while uops are not yet available in the instruction queue (IQ) or until an FE_BOUND event occurs besides OTHER and CISC. Also includes the issue slots that were consumed by the backend but were thrown away because they were younger than the mispredict or machine clear.",
