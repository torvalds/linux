command implements a multicast test which grabs and holds
N multicast addresses.
The purpose of the test is to see what
happens when a network interface is no longer able to filter
multicasts in hardware and has to switch to promiscuous or
multicast promiscuous mode.
A successful test does not have any
result, but an unsuccessful test will have deleterious side effects.
