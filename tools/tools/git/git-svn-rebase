# simple script to keep all my branches up to date while tracking
# FreeBSD (or any upstream svn source) with git. Run it often, and it
# will rebase all the branches so they don't get too stale.
# Takes no args, and acts goofy if you have really old branches
# which is why stable/* and mfc* are excluded. Caution to should be taken
# when using this.
