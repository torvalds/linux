.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
manages and inspects
.Xr vale 4
switches, for instance attaching and detaching interfaces, creating
and deleting persistent VALE ports, or listing the existing switches
and their ports.
In the following,
.Ar valeSSS
is the name of a VALE switch, while
.Ar valeSSS:PPP
is the name of a VALE port of
.Ar valeSSS .
.Pp
When issued without options it lists all the existing switch ports together
with their internal bridge number and port number.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl g Ar valeSSS:PPP
Print the number of receive rings of
.Ar valeSSS:PPP .
.It Fl a Ar valeSSS:interface
Attach
.Ar interface
(which must be an existing network interface) to
.Ar valeSSS
and detach it from the host stack.
.It Fl h Ar valeSSS:interface
Attach
.Ar interface
(which must be an existing network interface) to
.Ar valeSSS
while keeping it attached to the host stack.
More precisely, packets coming from
the host stack and directed to the interface will go through the switch, where
they can still reach the interface if the switch rules allow it.
Conversely, packets coming from the interface will go through the switch and,
if appropriate, will reach the host stack.
.It Fl d Ar valeSSS:interface
Detach
.Ar interface
from
.Ar valeSSS .
.It Fl n Ar interface
Create a new persistent VALE port with name
.Ar interface .
The name must be different from any other network interface
already present in the system.
.It Fl d Ar interface
Destroy the persistent VALE port with name
.Ar inteface .
.It Fl l Ar valeSSS:PPP
Show the internal bridge number and port number of the given switch port.
.It Fl p Ar valeSSS:PPP
Enable polling mode for
.Ar valeSSS:PPP .
In polling mode, a dedicated kernel thread is spawned to handle packets
received from
.Ar valeSSS:PPP
and push them into the switch.
The kernel thread busy waits on the switch port rather than relying on
interrupts or notifications.
Polling mode can only be used on physical NICs attached to a VALE switch.
.It Fl P Ar valeSSS:PPP
Disable polling mode for
.Ar valeSSS:PPP .
.It Fl C Ar x | Ar x,y | Ar x,y,z | Ar x,y,z,w
When used in conjunction with
.Fl n
it supplies the number of tx and rx rings and slots.
The full format with four numbers gives, in order, number of tx slots, number
of rx slots, number of tx rings and number of rx rings.
The form with three numbers uses
.Ar z
for both the number of tx and the number of rx rings.
The forms with less than two numbers use the default values for the number
of rings.
The form with two numbers supplies the numbers of tx and rx slots.
The form with only one number uses
.Ar x
for both the number of tx and the number of rx slots.
.Pp
When used in conjunction with
.Fl p
only the first three forms are used.
The first number may be either 0 or 1.
If 0, then all interface rings will be polled by a single thread, running
on the core id given by the second number (the third number, if present,
must be 1).
If the first number is 1, then the ring identified by the second number will
be polled by the core with the same id.
If a third number is given, then this is repeated for as many consecutive
rings and cores.
.It Fl m Ar memid
Used in conjunction with
.Fl n
supplies the netmap memory region identifier to use together with the newly
created persistent VALE port.
These ports use a private memory region by default.
Using this option you can let them share memory with other ports.
Pass 1 as
.Ar memid
to use the global memory region already shared by all
harware netmap ports.
