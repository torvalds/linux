# Missing Features:
# It would be nice to have OIDs separated into composite groups
# using the subsection mdoc(7) feature (.Ss) without adding extra
# files.
#
# The ability to notice when new OIDs are added to FreeBSD, and
# and the automation of their sorting and addition into the
# tunables.mdoc file.
#
# Perhaps a re-implementation in C?  This wouldn't be much of
# a challenge for the right individual but it may require a lot
# of changes to sysctl.h.  Eventually this utility should replace
# documenting sysctls in code and manual pages since this utility
# creates a manual page dynamicly based on the kernel.  This
# would kill duplication between manual pages and kernel code as
# well as improve the removal of sysctls when they are obsoleted.

.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
This manual page has been automatically generated by
a set of scripts written in
.Xr sh 1 .
The
.Xr mdoc 7
markup is stored in the database file and extracted
accordingly when invoked.
For information on the
.Xr sysctl 8
implementation, see the respecting manual pages.

.Sh BUGS
Sometimes
.Fx
.Nm sysctls
can be left undocumented by those who originally
implemented them.
This script was forged as a way to automatically
produce a manual page to aid in the administration and
configuration of a
.Fx
system.
It also gets around adding a bunch of supporting code to the
.Nm
interface.

.Sh NAME
.Nm sysctl
.Nd "list of available syctls based on kernel configuration"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fx
supports kernel alterations on the fly or at
system initialization by using a feature
known as a
.Nm
and a database.
Many values may be altered simply by using the
.Xr sysctl 8
utility followed by a
.Nm
and its new value at the command prompt.
For example:
.Dl sysctl kern.ipc.zero_copy.receive=1
will enable zero copy sockets for receive.
.Pp
Many variables may only be available if specific kernel
options are built into the kernel.
For example, the previous
.Nm
requires
.Xr zero_copy 9 .
.Pp
Most of these values only offer an enable/disable
option, altered by using a numerical value of
.Dq 0
or
.Dq 1
where the former is disable and latter is enable.
Other cases the
.Nm
may require a string value.
The
.Xr sysctl 8
utility may be used to dump a list of current
values which should provide an example of
the non-numeric cases.
.Pp
In cases where the value may not be altered, the
following warning will be issued:
.Dq read only value
and the
.Nm
will not be changed.
To alter these values, the administrator may place
them in the
.Xr sysctl.conf 5
file.
This will invoke the changes during
system initialization for those values
which may be altered.
In other cases, the
.Xr loader.conf 5
may be used.
Then again, some of these
.Nm sysctls
may never be altered.
.Pp
The
.Nm
supported by
.Xr sysctl 8
are:
