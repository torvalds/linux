.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
allows one to issue some number of test operations to the
.Xr ioat 4
driver on a specific hardware channel.
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar period
Configure the channel's interrupt coalescing period, in microseconds
(defaults to 0).
.It Fl E
Test non-contiguous 8k copy.
.It Fl f
Test block fill (by default,
.Nm
tests copy)
.It Fl m
Test memcpy instead of DMA.
.It Fl V
Verify copies/fills for accuracy
.It Fl z
Zero device statistics before running test.
.El
.Pp
Alternatively one can use
.Nm
.Fl r
to issue DMA to or from a specific
.Ar address .
The arguments in "raw" mode are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar period
As above.
.It Fl v
.Ar address
is a kernel virtual address (by default,
.Ar address
is assumed to be a physical address)
.It Fl V
Verify copies/fills for accuracy
.It Fl w
Write to the specified
.Ar address
(by default,
.Nm
.Fl r
reads)
.It Fl z
As above.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
operates in one of two modes; if the
.Ar duration
argument is passed,
.Nm
tries to estimate the copy rate in bytes per second by running
.Ar num_txns
repeatedly in loop.
If
.Ar duration
is not passed,
.Nm
only runs through
.Ar num_txns
once and prints the total bytes copied, as well as error information.
.Pp
The
.Ar bufsize
argument determines the size of buffers to use for each
.Fn ioat_copy
invocation.
The default is 256 KB.
In raw mode, the default is 4 KB.
.Pp
The
.Ar chain-len
argument determines the number of copies to chain together in a single DMA
transaction.
The default is 1.
.Pp
The
.Ar duration
argument specifies an approximate time limit for the test, in milliseconds.
.Pp
The test will allocate two chunks of memory for each component of each
transaction's chain.
It will initialize them with specific data patterns.
During the test, it submits DMA requests to copy between pairs of buffers.
If the
.Fl V
flag was specified, it will compare the contents in the callback for a copy
error.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /dev/ioat_test
.Pp
The interface between
.Nm
and
.Xr ioat 4 .
.Xr ioat 4
exposes it with
.Cd hw.ioat.enable_ioat_test=1 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The wait channel
.Va test_submit
indicates that the test code has enqueued all requested transactions and is
waiting on the IOAT hardware to complete one before issuing another operation.
