.Sh NAME
.Nm mctest
.Nd "multicast test"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl i Ar interface
.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl b Ar base port
.Op Fl n Ar number
.Op Fl s Ar size
.Op Fl t Ar inter-packet gap
.Op Fl M Ar number of clients (source only)
.Op Fl m Ar my client number (sink only)
.Op Fl r
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command implements a multicast test which involves a source
and a sink.
The source sends packets to a pre-configured
multicast address over the interface given as a command line
argument.
The sink listens for multicast packets, records
the time at which they are received and then reflects them back
over unicast to the source.
When the source has captured all
the reflected packets it prints out the round trip time of each.
.Pp
The source prints out the round trip time of packets sent to the
sinks.
The sink prints out the time between the packets received.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl i Ar interface"
.It Fl i Ar interface
Network interface, which can be found with
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.It Fl g Ar group
Multicast group.
.It Fl b Ar base port
Port on which to listen.
.It Fl s Ar size
Packet size in bytes.
.It Fl n Ar number
Number of packets.
.It Fl t Ar gap
Inter-packet gap in nanoseconds.
.It Fl M Ar clients
The number of clients that are listening.
.It Fl m Ar my number
The client's number 0, 1, etc.
.It Fl r
This version of
.Nm
is the receiver aka the sink.
This option MUST
only be used with one copy of the program at a time.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following is an example of a typical usage
of the
.Nm
command:
.Pp
Source
.Dl "mctest -i em0 -M 1 -s 1024 -n 100 -t 1"
Sink
.Dl "mctest -i em0 -m 0 -s 1024 -n 100 -r"
.Pp
Send 100 packets of 1024 bytes, with an inter-packet gap of 1 nanosecond.
.Pp
Gaps are measured with
.Xr nanosleep 2 ,
and so are not accurate down to nanoseconds
but depend on the setting of
.Va kern.hz .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr netstat 1 ,
.Xr nanosleep 2 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program first appeared in
.Fx 7.0 .
