About sysbuild.sh
=================

I have been running -current on my laptop since before FreeBSD 2.0 was
released and along the way developed this little trick to making the
task easier.

sysbuild.sh is a way to build a new FreeBSD system on a computer from
a specification, while leaving the current installation intact.

sysbuild.sh assume you have two partitions that can hold your rootfs
and can be booted, and roughly speaking, all it does is build a new
system into the one you don't use, from the one you do use.

A partition named /freebsd is assumed to be part of your layout, and
that is where the sources and ports will be found.

If you know how nanobsd works, you will find a lot of similarity.

HOWTO
=====

In all likelihood, it is easier if we imagine you start with a blank
computer.

Grab a FreeBSD install ISO and boot it.

Create four disk slices:

	ad0s1 = 5GB
	ad0s2 = 5GB
	ad0s3 = 5GB
	ad0s4 = the rest

Create a root filesystem in s1a filling the entire ad0s1 slice.

Create a swap partition, if you want one, in ad0s4b.

Install the boot0 bootmanager.

Install the "Minimal" FreeBSD system into ad0s1a.

Reboot from the newly installed system.

Run these commands to set up the other partitions sysbuild.sh cares about:

	# /freebsd filesystem
	newfs -b 4096 -f 512 -O2 -U /dev/ad0s3
	echo "/dev/ad0s3 /freebsd ufs rw 2 2" >> /etc/fstab
	mkdir /freebsd
	mount /freebsd

	# deputy rootfilesystem
	bsdlabel -B -w /dev/ad0s2
	newfs -O2 -U /dev/ad0s2a

Next, install ports and sources:

	cd /usr
	rm -rf ports src
	ln -s /freebsd/src
	ln -s /freebsd/ports
	cd /freebsd
	mkdir ports src packages

	svn co https://svn0.us-east.FreeBSD.org/base/stable/10 src
	svn co https://svn0.us-east.FreeBSD.org/ports/head ports

And we should be ready to try a shot:

	cd /root
	cp /usr/src/tools/tools/sysbuild/sysbuild.sh .
	sh sysbuild.sh |& tee _.sb

If it succeeds, you should be able to:

	boot0cfg -s 2 -v /dev/ad0
	reboot

And come up with your newly built system.

	Next time you want a new system, you just run sysbuild.sh again
	and boot slice 1 when it's done.

TWEAKS
======

The sysbuild.sh script takes various parameters:

	-c specfile	# configure stuff, see below.
	-w		# skip buildworld, assume it was done earlier.
	-k		# skip buildkernel, ---//---
	-b		# skip both buildworld & buildkernel
	-p		# install cached packacges if found.

The specfile is a shellscript where you can override or set a number of
shell variables and functions.

A partial example:

	# use a kernel different from GENERIC
	KERNCONF=SMP

	# Cache built packages, so we can use -p
	PKG_DIR=/freebsd/packages

	# Mount ports distfiles from another machine
	REMOTEDISTFILES=fs:/rdonly/distfiles

	# Fetch distfiles through a proxy
	FTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:3128/
	HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:3128/
	export FTP_PROXY HTTP_PROXY

	# We want these ports
	PORTS_WE_WANT='
		/usr/ports/archivers/unzip
		/usr/ports/archivers/zip
		/usr/ports/cad/linux-eagle
		/usr/ports/comms/lrzsz
		/usr/ports/databases/rrdtool 
		/usr/ports/devel/subversion-freebsd
	'

	# Files to move over
	CONFIGFILES='
		/root/.ssh
		/etc/X11/xorg.conf
		/etc/ssh/ssh_host*
		/etc/rc.conf
		/etc/rc.local
	'

	# Shell functions to tweak things
	# (This makes commits to /etc mostly painless)
	final_chroot() (
		chpass -p "\$1\$IgMjWs2L\$Nu12OCsjfiwHHj0I7TmUN1" root

		pw useradd phk -u 488 -d /home/phk -c "Poul-Henning Kamp" \
		    -G "wheel,operator,dialer" -s /bin/csh -w none

		chpass -p "\$1\$VcM.9Ow8\$IcXHs0h9jsk27b8N64lOm/" phk

		sed -i "" -e 's/^DS/DSorigo.freebsd.dk/' /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
		sed -i "" -e '/console/s/^/#/' /etc/syslog.conf
		echo "beastie_disable=YES" >> /boot/loader.conf
		touch /root/.hushlogin
	)
