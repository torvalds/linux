# See pf.conf(5) and /usr/share/examples/pf for syntax and examples.
# Required order: options, normalization, queueing, translation, filtering.
# Macros and tables may be defined and used anywhere.
# Note that translation rules are first match while filter rules are last match.

# Macros: define common values, so they can be referenced and changed easily.
#ext_if="ext0"	# replace with actual external interface name i.e., dc0
#int_if="int0"	# replace with actual internal interface name i.e., dc1
#internal_net="10.1.1.1/8"

# Tables: similar to macros, but more flexible for many addresses.

# Normalization: reassemble fragments and resolve or reduce traffic ambiguities.
#scrub in all

# Queueing: rule-based bandwidth control.
#altq on $ext_if bandwidth 2Mb cbq queue { dflt, developers, marketing }
#queue dflt bandwidth 5% cbq(default)
#queue developers bandwidth 80%
#queue marketing  bandwidth 15%

# Translation: specify how addresses are to be mapped or redirected.
# nat: packets going out through $ext_if with source address $internal_net will
# get translated as coming from the address of $ext_if, a state is created for
# such packets, and incoming packets will be redirected to the internal address.
#nat on $ext_if from $internal_net to any -> ($ext_if)

# rdr: packets coming in on $ext_if with destination $external_addr:1234 will
# be redirected to 10.1.1.1:5678. A state is created for such packets, and
# outgoing packets will be translated as coming from the external address.
#rdr on $ext_if proto tcp from any to $external_addr/32 port 1234 -> 10.1.1.1 port 5678

# rdr outgoing FTP requests to the ftp-proxy
#rdr on $int_if proto tcp from any to any port ftp -> 127.0.0.1 port 8021

#table <spamd> persist
#no rdr on { lo0, lo1 } from any to any
#rdr inet proto tcp from <spamd> to any port smtp -> 127.0.0.1 port 8025

# Filtering: the implicit first two rules are
#pass in all
#pass out all

# block all incoming packets but allow ssh, pass all outgoing tcp and udp
# connections and keep state, logging blocked packets.
#block in log all
#pass  in  on $ext_if proto tcp from any to $ext_if port 22 keep state
#pass  out on $ext_if proto { tcp, udp } all keep state
