.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is an alternative user interface for controlling virtual network
stacks in FreeBSD, aimed primarily at supporting legacy applications
which are not yet converted to using
.Xr jail 8 ,
.Xr jexec 8 ,
and
.Xr jls 8 .
.
.Ss Overview
A virtual image or vimage is a jail with its own independent network
stack instance.  Every process, socket and network interface present
in the system is always attached to one, and only one, virtual network
stack instance (vnet).
During system bootup sequence a default vnet
is created to which all the configured interfaces and user processes
are initially attached.
Assuming that enough system resources are
are available, a user with sufficient privileges can create and manage
a hierarchy of subordinated virtual images.
The
.Nm
command allows for creation, deletion and monitoring of virtual images,
as well as for execution of arbitrary processes in a targeted virtual
image.
.Ss Invocation
If invoked with no modifiers, the
.Nm
command spawns a new interactive shell in virtual image
.Ar vname .
If optional additional arguments following
.Ar vname
are provided, the first of those will be executed in place of the
interactive shell, and the rest of the arguments will be passed as
arguments to the executed command.
.Pp
The following modifiers are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Create a new virtual image named
.Ar vname .
Additional arguments, if provided, may be used to specify operating
parameters different from defaults, in format
.Ar param=value .
See
.Xr jail 8
for an extensive list of available parameters.
.It Fl m
Modify the parameters of a virtual image named
.Ar vname ,
using the same syntax as with the -c form of the command.
.It Fl d
Delete the virtual image
.Ar vname .
No processes and/or sockets should exist in the target virtual image
in order for the delete request to succeed.  Non-loopback interfaces
residing in the target virtual image will be reassigned to the virtual
image's parent.
.It Fl l
List the properties and statistics for virtual images one level
below the current one in the hierarchy. If an optional argument
.Ar vname
is provided, only the information regarding the target virtual image
.Ar vname
is displayed.
With the optional
.Op Ar -r
switch enabled the list will include all virtual images below the
current level in the vimage hierarchy.
Enabling the optional
.Op Ar -v
or
.Op Ar -j
switches results in a more detailed output.
.It Fl i
Move interface
.Ar ifname
to the target virtual image
.Ar vname .
Interfaces will be automatically renamed to
.So
ethXX
.Sc ,
unless an optional argument specifying the desired interface name
.Op Ar newifname
is provided.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a new virtual image named
.So v1
.Sc ,
which is allowed to create and manage an own subhierarchy of vimages:
.Pp
.Dl vimage -c v1 children.max=100
.Pp
Execute the
.So ifconfig
.Sc command in the virtual image
.So v1
.Sc :
.Pp
.Dl vimage v1 ifconfig
.Pp
Move the interface
.So vlan0
.Sc to the virtual image
.So v1
.Sc while renaming the interface as
.So
ve0
.Sc :
.Pp
.Dl vimage -i v1 vlan0 ve0
.Pp
Show the status information for virtual image
.So v1
.Sc :
.Pp
.Dl vimage -lv v1
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
command exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

.Sh HISTORY
Network stack virtualization framework first appeared as a patchset
against the FreeBSD 4.7 kernel in 2002, and was maintained outside
of the main FreeBSD tree.
As a result of a project sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation and
Stiching NLNet, integrated virtualized network stack first appeared
in FreeBSD 8.0.

.Sh BUGS
Deletion of vimages / vnets is known to leak kernel memory and fail at
stopping various timers, hence may lead to system crashes.
