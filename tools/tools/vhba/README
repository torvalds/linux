This packages is a testbed for a number of purposes and consists
of two pieces.

The first piece is a simple SIM driver for FreeBSD. It provides
*just enough* framework to be useful, plus some nominally common
code responses for code sharing purposes.

The second piece(s) are underlying implementations which make various
virtual devices implemented under the VHBA itself. The current ones
are pretty much used to stress and test the FreeBSD CAM framework
itself- this is why this is in the tool directory.

Clearly other connections and possibilities exist as well.
