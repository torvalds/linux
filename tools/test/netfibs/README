# $FreeBSD$

This directory holds scripts and a support program for multiple test cases
exercising multi-IP FIBs.  At this time only IPv6 test cases are provided.

Makefile
reflect.c

	Makefile just builds reflect, a program to echo data on a TCP or UDP
	socket in very simplistic ways.  It has a couple of options to provide
	an address or port, a FIB to bind to or a FIB to add to a reflected
	message as well as some "magic" keyword handling to let the intiators
	control it.

initiator.sh and reflector.sh

	intiator.sh runs two local test cases, one which shows a documented
	limitation.

	All further tests are either exercising the sending or receiving of
	ICMP6, TCP or UDP packets with multiple FIBs.  initiator.sh and
	reflector.sh must run on two different nodes both having a network
	interface in the same broadcast domain (be it cross-over or on a
	bridge/switch).  The tests will use the IPv6 benchmarking working
	group (BMWG) prefix.  The prefix is hard coded into some tests.
	Control messages will synchronize reflector with initiator.  The
	reflector needs the reflect binary.  Apart from that the scripts
	depend on ping6, netcat, awk, tr and ipfw.  The interface to use can
	be set from the environment.  The commands can be run like:
	
	env IFACE=ifname sh intiator.sh
	env IFACE=ifname sh reflector.sh
	
	Both scripts also support a DEBUG environment variable for additional
	output.  A special value of 42 will enable sh(1) xtrace printing.

	The output format is modeled after Test::Harness Perl as used in
	tools/regression/ but not always compliant following the test case name.

	NOTE: at the time of writing reflector.sh can trigger kernel races
	unrelated to multi-FIB test leading to a panic(9).  "delay" calls
	are used to mitigate the problem some but are not always good enough.
	It is suggested to run one test case at a time manually disabling
	the others in both scripts.

forwarding.sh

	forwarding.sh tests FIBs in the forwarding path, making sure that
	packets tagged on input are leaving on the correct FIB.
	The script must be run on three nodes with both edge nodes (left
	and right) being connected to the middle node on separate interfaces.

	The script operates on the same principles and requirements as the
	two afore described ones.  Environment options equally apply, with
	the middle node also taking an IFACEFAR variable to name the interface
	to the right.   See the ASCII art at the beginning of the script for
	details. The script needs to be told which node it is running with
	the first argument:

	env IFACE=ifname sh forwarding.sh left
	env IFACE=leftifname IFACEFAR=rightifname sh forwarding.sh middle
	env IFACE=ifname sh forwarding.sh right
