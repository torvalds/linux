Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

Do not skip this step even if you are only upgrading one minor version. 
New configuration options are added in each release,
and odd problems will turn up if the configuration files are not set up as expected.
If you want to carry your existing configuration to a new version with minimal work,
use make oldconfig, which will only ask you for the answers to new questions.
