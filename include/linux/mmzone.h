 *    up short of free memory since the last time (last_fullzone_zap)
 *    we zero'd fullzones.
 * 2) The array z_to_n[] maps each zone in the zonelist to its node
 *    id, so that we can efficiently evaluate whether that node is
 *    set in the current tasks mems_allowed.
 *
 * Both fullzones and z_to_n[] are one-to-one with the zonelist,
 * indexed by a zones offset in the zonelist zones[] array.
 *
 * The get_page_from_freelist() routine does two scans.  During the
 * first scan, we skip zones whose corresponding bit in 'fullzones'
 * is set or whose corresponding node in current->mems_allowed (which
 * comes from cpusets) is not set.  During the second scan, we bypass
 * this zonelist_cache, to ensure we look methodically at each zone.
 *
 * Once per second, we zero out (zap) fullzones, forcing us to
 * reconsider nodes that might have regained more free memory.
 * The field last_full_zap is the time we last zapped fullzones.
 *
 * This mechanism reduces the amount of time we waste repeatedly
 * reexaming zones for free memory when they just came up low on
 * memory momentarilly ago.
 *
 * The zonelist_cache struct members logically belong in struct
 * zonelist.  However, the mempolicy zonelists constructed for
 * MPOL_BIND are intentionally variable length (and usually much
 * shorter).  A general purpose mechanism for handling structs with
 * multiple variable length members is more mechanism than we want
 * here.  We resort to some special case hackery instead.
 *
 * The MPOL_BIND zonelists don't need this zonelist_cache (in good
 * part because they are shorter), so we put the fixed length stuff
 * at the front of the zonelist struct, ending in a variable length
 * zones[], as is needed by MPOL_BIND.
 *
 * Then we put the optional zonelist cache on the end of the zonelist
 * struct.  This optional stuff is found by a 'zlcache_ptr' pointer in
 * the fixed length portion at the front of the struct.  This pointer
 * both enables us to find the zonelist cache, and in the case of
 * MPOL_BIND zonelists, (which will just set the zlcache_ptr to NULL)
 * to know that the zonelist cache is not there.
 *
 * The end result is that struct zonelists come in two flavors:
 *  1) The full, fixed length version, shown below, and
 *  2) The custom zonelists for MPOL_BIND.
 * The custom MPOL_BIND zonelists have a NULL zlcache_ptr and no zlcache.
 *
 * Even though there may be multiple CPU cores on a node modifying
 * fullzones or last_full_zap in the same zonelist_cache at the same
 * time, we don't lock it.  This is just hint data - if it is wrong now
 * and then, the allocator will still function, perhaps a bit slower.
