 * a page is on one of lrugen->folios[]. Otherwise it stores 0.
 *
 * A page is added to the youngest generation on faulting. The aging needs to
 * check the accessed bit at least twice before handing this page over to the
 * eviction. The first check takes care of the accessed bit set on the initial
 * fault; the second check makes sure this page hasn't been used since then.
 * This process, AKA second chance, requires a minimum of two generations,
 * hence MIN_NR_GENS. And to maintain ABI compatibility with the active/inactive
 * LRU, e.g., /proc/vmstat, these two generations are considered active; the
 * rest of generations, if they exist, are considered inactive. See
 * lru_gen_is_active().
 *
 * PG_active is always cleared while a page is on one of lrugen->folios[] so
 * that the aging needs not to worry about it. And it's set again when a page
 * considered active is isolated for non-reclaiming purposes, e.g., migration.
 * See lru_gen_add_folio() and lru_gen_del_folio().
 *
 * MAX_NR_GENS is set to 4 so that the multi-gen LRU can support twice the
 * number of categories of the active/inactive LRU when keeping track of
 * accesses through page tables. This requires order_base_2(MAX_NR_GENS+1) bits

 * tables or read ahead. A page in any other tier (N>1) is marked by
 * PG_referenced and PG_workingset. This implies a minimum of two tiers is
 * supported without using additional bits in folio->flags.
 *
 * In contrast to moving across generations which requires the LRU lock, moving

 *
 * There are four operations:

 * 2. MEMCG_LRU_TAIL, which moves an memcg to the tail of a random bin in its

 * 3. MEMCG_LRU_OLD, which moves an memcg to the head of a random bin in the old

 * 4. MEMCG_LRU_YOUNG, which moves an memcg to the tail of a random bin in the
 *    young generation, updates its "gen" to "young" and resets its "seg" to
 *    "default".
 *
 * The events that trigger the above operations are:
 * 1. Exceeding the soft limit, which triggers MEMCG_LRU_HEAD;
 * 2. The first attempt to reclaim an memcg below low, which triggers
 *    MEMCG_LRU_TAIL;
 * 3. The first attempt to reclaim an memcg below reclaimable size threshold,
 *    which triggers MEMCG_LRU_TAIL;
 * 4. The second attempt to reclaim an memcg below reclaimable size threshold,
 *    which triggers MEMCG_LRU_YOUNG;
 * 5. Attempting to reclaim an memcg below min, which triggers MEMCG_LRU_YOUNG;
 * 6. Finishing the aging on the eviction path, which triggers MEMCG_LRU_YOUNG;
 * 7. Offlining an memcg, which triggers MEMCG_LRU_OLD.
 *
 * Note that memcg LRU only applies to global reclaim, and the round-robin

	 * ZONE_MOVABLE is similar to ZONE_NORMAL, except that it contains

	 * cases for ZONE_MOVABLE are to make memory offlining/unplug more
	 * likely to succeed, and to locally limit unmovable allocations - e.g.,
	 * to increase the number of THP/huge pages. Notable special cases are:
	 *
	 * 1. Pinned pages: (long-term) pinning of movable pages might
	 *    essentially turn such pages unmovable. Therefore, we do not allow
	 *    pinning long-term pages in ZONE_MOVABLE. When pages are pinned and
	 *    faulted, they come from the right zone right away. However, it is
	 *    still possible that address space already has pages in
	 *    ZONE_MOVABLE at the time when pages are pinned (i.e. user has
	 *    touches that memory before pinning). In such case we migrate them
	 *    to a different zone. When migration fails - pinning fails.
	 * 2. memblock allocations: kernelcore/movablecore setups might create
	 *    situations where ZONE_MOVABLE contains unmovable allocations
	 *    after boot. Memory offlining and allocations fail early.
	 * 3. Memory holes: kernelcore/movablecore setups might create very rare
	 *    situations where ZONE_MOVABLE contains memory holes after boot,
	 *    for example, if we have sections that are only partially
	 *    populated. Memory offlining and allocations fail early.
	 * 4. PG_hwpoison pages: while poisoned pages can be skipped during
	 *    memory offlining, such pages cannot be allocated.
	 * 5. Unmovable PG_offline pages: in paravirtualized environments,
	 *    hotplugged memory blocks might only partially be managed by the
	 *    buddy (e.g., via XEN-balloon, Hyper-V balloon, virtio-mem). The
	 *    parts not manged by the buddy are unmovable PG_offline pages. In
	 *    some cases (virtio-mem), such pages can be skipped during
	 *    memory offlining, however, cannot be moved/allocated. These
	 *    techniques might use alloc_contig_range() to hide previously
	 *    exposed pages from the buddy again (e.g., to implement some sort
	 *    of memory unplug in virtio-mem).
	 * 6. ZERO_PAGE(0), kernelcore/movablecore setups might create
	 *    situations where ZERO_PAGE(0) which is allocated differently
	 *    on different platforms may end up in a movable zone. ZERO_PAGE(0)
	 *    cannot be migrated.
	 * 7. Memory-hotplug: when using memmap_on_memory and onlining the
	 *    memory to the MOVABLE zone, the vmemmap pages are also placed in
	 *    such zone. Such pages cannot be really moved around as they are
	 *    self-stored in the range, but they are treated as movable when
	 *    the range they describe is about to be offlined.
	 *
	 * In general, no unmovable allocations that degrade memory offlining
	 * should end up in ZONE_MOVABLE. Allocators (like alloc_contig_range())
	 * have to expect that migrating pages in ZONE_MOVABLE can fail (even
	 * if has_unmovable_pages() states that there are no unmovable pages,
	 * there can be false negatives).
