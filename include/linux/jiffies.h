 * We want to do realistic conversions of time so we need to use the same
 * values the update wall clock code uses as the jiffies size.  This value
 * is: TICK_NSEC (which is defined in timex.h).  This
 * is a constant and is in nanoseconds.  We will used scaled math
 * with a set of scales defined here as SEC_JIFFIE_SC,  USEC_JIFFIE_SC and
 * NSEC_JIFFIE_SC.  Note that these defines contain nothing but
 * constants and so are computed at compile time.  SHIFT_HZ (computed in
 * timex.h) adjusts the scaling for different HZ values.

 * Scaled math???  What is that?
 *
 * Scaled math is a way to do integer math on values that would,
 * otherwise, either overflow, underflow, or cause undesired div
 * instructions to appear in the execution path.  In short, we "scale"
 * up the operands so they take more bits (more precision, less
 * underflow), do the desired operation and then "scale" the result back
 * by the same amount.  If we do the scaling by shifting we avoid the
 * costly mpy and the dastardly div instructions.

 * Suppose, for example, we want to convert from seconds to jiffies
 * where jiffies is defined in nanoseconds as NSEC_PER_JIFFIE.  The
 * simple math is: jiff = (sec * NSEC_PER_SEC) / NSEC_PER_JIFFIE; We
 * observe that (NSEC_PER_SEC / NSEC_PER_JIFFIE) is a constant which we
 * might calculate at compile time, however, the result will only have
 * about 3-4 bits of precision (less for smaller values of HZ).
 *
 * So, we scale as follows:
 * jiff = (sec) * (NSEC_PER_SEC / NSEC_PER_JIFFIE);
 * jiff = ((sec) * ((NSEC_PER_SEC * SCALE)/ NSEC_PER_JIFFIE)) / SCALE;
 * Then we make SCALE a power of two so:
 * jiff = ((sec) * ((NSEC_PER_SEC << SCALE)/ NSEC_PER_JIFFIE)) >> SCALE;
 * Now we define:
 * #define SEC_CONV = ((NSEC_PER_SEC << SCALE)/ NSEC_PER_JIFFIE))
 * jiff = (sec * SEC_CONV) >> SCALE;
 *
 * Often the math we use will expand beyond 32-bits so we tell C how to
 * do this and pass the 64-bit result of the mpy through the ">> SCALE"
 * which should take the result back to 32-bits.  We want this expansion
 * to capture as much precision as possible.  At the same time we don't
 * want to overflow so we pick the SCALE to avoid this.  In this file,
 * that means using a different scale for each range of HZ values (as
 * defined in timex.h).
 *
 * For those who want to know, gcc will give a 64-bit result from a "*"
 * operator if the result is a long long AND at least one of the
 * operands is cast to long long (usually just prior to the "*" so as
 * not to confuse it into thinking it really has a 64-bit operand,
 * which, buy the way, it can do, but it take more code and at least 2
 * mpys).

 * We also need to be aware that one second in nanoseconds is only a
 * couple of bits away from overflowing a 32-bit word, so we MUST use
 * 64-bits to get the full range time in nanoseconds.

 */

/*
 * Here are the scales we will use.  One for seconds, nanoseconds and
 * microseconds.
 *
 * Within the limits of cpp we do a rough cut at the SEC_JIFFIE_SC and
 * check if the sign bit is set.  If not, we bump the shift count by 1.
 * (Gets an extra bit of precision where we can use it.)
 * We know it is set for HZ = 1024 and HZ = 100 not for 1000.
 * Haven't tested others.

 * Limits of cpp (for #if expressions) only long (no long long), but
 * then we only need the most signicant bit.
