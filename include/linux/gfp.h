/**
 * DOC: Reclaim modifiers
 *
 * Reclaim modifiers
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Please note that all the following flags are only applicable to sleepable
 * allocations (e.g. %GFP_NOWAIT and %GFP_ATOMIC will ignore them).
 *
 * %__GFP_IO can start physical IO.
 *
 * %__GFP_FS can call down to the low-level FS. Clearing the flag avoids the
 * allocator recursing into the filesystem which might already be holding
 * locks.
 *
 * %__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM indicates that the caller may enter direct reclaim.
 * This flag can be cleared to avoid unnecessary delays when a fallback
 * option is available.
 *
 * %__GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM indicates that the caller wants to wake kswapd when
 * the low watermark is reached and have it reclaim pages until the high
 * watermark is reached. A caller may wish to clear this flag when fallback
 * options are available and the reclaim is likely to disrupt the system. The
 * canonical example is THP allocation where a fallback is cheap but
 * reclaim/compaction may cause indirect stalls.
 *
 * %__GFP_RECLAIM is shorthand to allow/forbid both direct and kswapd reclaim.
 *
 * The default allocator behavior depends on the request size. We have a concept
 * of so called costly allocations (with order > %PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER).
 * !costly allocations are too essential to fail so they are implicitly
 * non-failing by default (with some exceptions like OOM victims might fail so
 * the caller still has to check for failures) while costly requests try to be
 * not disruptive and back off even without invoking the OOM killer.
 * The following three modifiers might be used to override some of these
 * implicit rules
 *
 * %__GFP_NORETRY: The VM implementation will try only very lightweight
 * memory direct reclaim to get some memory under memory pressure (thus
 * it can sleep). It will avoid disruptive actions like OOM killer. The
 * caller must handle the failure which is quite likely to happen under
 * heavy memory pressure. The flag is suitable when failure can easily be
 * handled at small cost, such as reduced throughput
 *
 * %__GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL: The VM implementation will retry memory reclaim
 * procedures that have previously failed if there is some indication
 * that progress has been made else where.  It can wait for other
 * tasks to attempt high level approaches to freeing memory such as
 * compaction (which removes fragmentation) and page-out.
 * There is still a definite limit to the number of retries, but it is
 * a larger limit than with %__GFP_NORETRY.
 * Allocations with this flag may fail, but only when there is
 * genuinely little unused memory. While these allocations do not
 * directly trigger the OOM killer, their failure indicates that
 * the system is likely to need to use the OOM killer soon.  The
 * caller must handle failure, but can reasonably do so by failing
 * a higher-level request, or completing it only in a much less
 * efficient manner.
 * If the allocation does fail, and the caller is in a position to
 * free some non-essential memory, doing so could benefit the system
 * as a whole.
 *
 * %__GFP_NOFAIL: The VM implementation _must_ retry infinitely: the caller
 * cannot handle allocation failures. The allocation could block
 * indefinitely but will never return with failure. Testing for
 * failure is pointless.
 * New users should be evaluated carefully (and the flag should be
 * used only when there is no reasonable failure policy) but it is
 * definitely preferable to use the flag rather than opencode endless
 * loop around allocator.
 * Using this flag for costly allocations is _highly_ discouraged.

/**
 * DOC: Useful GFP flag combinations
 *
 * Useful GFP flag combinations
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Useful GFP flag combinations that are commonly used. It is recommended
 * that subsystems start with one of these combinations and then set/clear
 * %__GFP_FOO flags as necessary.
 *
 * %GFP_ATOMIC users can not sleep and need the allocation to succeed. A lower
 * watermark is applied to allow access to "atomic reserves".
 * The current implementation doesn't support NMI and few other strict
 * non-preemptive contexts (e.g. raw_spin_lock). The same applies to %GFP_NOWAIT.
 *
 * %GFP_KERNEL is typical for kernel-internal allocations. The caller requires
 * %ZONE_NORMAL or a lower zone for direct access but can direct reclaim.
 *
 * %GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT is the same as GFP_KERNEL, except the allocation is
 * accounted to kmemcg.
 *
 * %GFP_NOWAIT is for kernel allocations that should not stall for direct
 * reclaim, start physical IO or use any filesystem callback.
 *
 * %GFP_NOIO will use direct reclaim to discard clean pages or slab pages
 * that do not require the starting of any physical IO.
 * Please try to avoid using this flag directly and instead use
 * memalloc_noio_{save,restore} to mark the whole scope which cannot
 * perform any IO with a short explanation why. All allocation requests
 * will inherit GFP_NOIO implicitly.
 *
 * %GFP_NOFS will use direct reclaim but will not use any filesystem interfaces.
 * Please try to avoid using this flag directly and instead use
 * memalloc_nofs_{save,restore} to mark the whole scope which cannot/shouldn't
 * recurse into the FS layer with a short explanation why. All allocation
 * requests will inherit GFP_NOFS implicitly.
 *
 * %GFP_USER is for userspace allocations that also need to be directly
 * accessibly by the kernel or hardware. It is typically used by hardware
 * for buffers that are mapped to userspace (e.g. graphics) that hardware
 * still must DMA to. cpuset limits are enforced for these allocations.
 *
 * %GFP_DMA exists for historical reasons and should be avoided where possible.
 * The flags indicates that the caller requires that the lowest zone be
 * used (%ZONE_DMA or 16M on x86-64). Ideally, this would be removed but
 * it would require careful auditing as some users really require it and
 * others use the flag to avoid lowmem reserves in %ZONE_DMA and treat the
 * lowest zone as a type of emergency reserve.
 *
 * %GFP_DMA32 is similar to %GFP_DMA except that the caller requires a 32-bit
 * address.
 *
 * %GFP_HIGHUSER is for userspace allocations that may be mapped to userspace,
 * do not need to be directly accessible by the kernel but that cannot
 * move once in use. An example may be a hardware allocation that maps
 * data directly into userspace but has no addressing limitations.
 *
 * %GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE is for userspace allocations that the kernel does not
 * need direct access to but can use kmap() when access is required. They
 * are expected to be movable via page reclaim or page migration. Typically,
 * pages on the LRU would also be allocated with %GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE.
 *
 * %GFP_TRANSHUGE and %GFP_TRANSHUGE_LIGHT are used for THP allocations. They
 * are compound allocations that will generally fail quickly if memory is not
 * available and will not wake kswapd/kcompactd on failure. The _LIGHT
 * version does not attempt reclaim/compaction at all and is by default used
 * in page fault path, while the non-light is used by khugepaged.
