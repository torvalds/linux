 * address when the driver is probed. When relevant inbound messages arrive
 * (i.e. messages which their dst address equals to the src address of
 * the rpmsg channel), the driver's handler is invoked to process it.
 *
 * More complicated drivers though, that do need to allocate additional rpmsg
 * addresses, and bind them to different rx callbacks, must explicitly
 * create additional endpoints by themselves (see rpmsg_create_ept()).
