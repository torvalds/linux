 *	current alpha2 if it found a match. It also provides
 * 	NL80211_ATTR_REG_RULE_FLAGS, and a set of regulatory rules. Each
 * 	regulatory rule is a nested set of attributes  given by

 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_MESH_PARAMS: Set mesh networking properties for the
 *      interface identified by %NL80211_ATTR_IFINDEX
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_MGMT_EXTRA_IE: Set extra IEs for management frames. The
 *	interface is identified with %NL80211_ATTR_IFINDEX and the management
 *	frame subtype with %NL80211_ATTR_MGMT_SUBTYPE. The extra IE data to be
 *	added to the end of the specified management frame is specified with
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_IE. If the command succeeds, the requested data will be
 *	added to all specified management frames generated by
 *	kernel/firmware/driver.
 *	Note: This command has been removed and it is only reserved at this
 *	point to avoid re-using existing command number. The functionality this
 *	command was planned for has been provided with cleaner design with the
 *	option to specify additional IEs in NL80211_CMD_TRIGGER_SCAN,
 *	NL80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE, NL80211_CMD_ASSOCIATE,
 *	NL80211_CMD_DEAUTHENTICATE, and NL80211_CMD_DISASSOCIATE.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_GET_SCAN: get scan results
 * @NL80211_CMD_TRIGGER_SCAN: trigger a new scan with the given parameters
 * @NL80211_CMD_NEW_SCAN_RESULTS: scan notification (as a reply to
 *	NL80211_CMD_GET_SCAN and on the "scan" multicast group)
 * @NL80211_CMD_SCAN_ABORTED: scan was aborted, for unspecified reasons,
 *	partial scan results may be available
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_REG_CHANGE: indicates to userspace the regulatory domain
 * 	has been changed and provides details of the request information
 * 	that caused the change such as who initiated the regulatory request
 * 	(%NL80211_ATTR_REG_INITIATOR), the wiphy_idx
 * 	(%NL80211_ATTR_REG_ALPHA2) on which the request was made from if
 * 	the initiator was %NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_COUNTRY_IE or
 * 	%NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_DRIVER, the type of regulatory domain
 * 	set (%NL80211_ATTR_REG_TYPE), if the type of regulatory domain is
 * 	%NL80211_REG_TYPE_COUNTRY the alpha2 to which we have moved on
 * 	to (%NL80211_ATTR_REG_ALPHA2).
 * @NL80211_CMD_REG_BEACON_HINT: indicates to userspace that an AP beacon
 * 	has been found while world roaming thus enabling active scan or
 * 	any mode of operation that initiates TX (beacons) on a channel
 * 	where we would not have been able to do either before. As an example
 * 	if you are world roaming (regulatory domain set to world or if your
 * 	driver is using a custom world roaming regulatory domain) and while
 * 	doing a passive scan on the 5 GHz band you find an AP there (if not
 * 	on a DFS channel) you will now be able to actively scan for that AP
 * 	or use AP mode on your card on that same channel. Note that this will
 * 	never be used for channels 1-11 on the 2 GHz band as they are always
 * 	enabled world wide. This beacon hint is only sent if your device had
 * 	either disabled active scanning or beaconing on a channel. We send to
 * 	userspace the wiphy on which we removed a restriction from
 * 	(%NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY) and the channel on which this occurred
 * 	before (%NL80211_ATTR_FREQ_BEFORE) and after (%NL80211_ATTR_FREQ_AFTER)
 * 	the beacon hint was processed.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE: authentication request and notification.
 *	This command is used both as a command (request to authenticate) and
 *	as an event on the "mlme" multicast group indicating completion of the
 *	authentication process.
 *	When used as a command, %NL80211_ATTR_IFINDEX is used to identify the
 *	interface. %NL80211_ATTR_MAC is used to specify PeerSTAAddress (and
 *	BSSID in case of station mode). %NL80211_ATTR_SSID is used to specify
 *	the SSID (mainly for association, but is included in authentication
 *	request, too, to help BSS selection. %NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_FREQ is used
 *	to specify the frequence of the channel in MHz. %NL80211_ATTR_AUTH_TYPE
 *	is used to specify the authentication type. %NL80211_ATTR_IE is used to
 *	define IEs (VendorSpecificInfo, but also including RSN IE and FT IEs)
 *	to be added to the frame.
 *	When used as an event, this reports reception of an Authentication
 *	frame in station and IBSS modes when the local MLME processed the
 *	frame, i.e., it was for the local STA and was received in correct
 *	state. This is similar to MLME-AUTHENTICATE.confirm primitive in the
 *	MLME SAP interface (kernel providing MLME, userspace SME). The
 *	included NL80211_ATTR_FRAME attribute contains the management frame
 *	(including both the header and frame body, but not FCS).
 * @NL80211_CMD_ASSOCIATE: association request and notification; like
 *	NL80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE but for Association and Reassociation
 *	(similar to MLME-ASSOCIATE.request, MLME-REASSOCIATE.request,
 *	MLME-ASSOCIATE.confirm or MLME-REASSOCIATE.confirm primitives).
 * @NL80211_CMD_DEAUTHENTICATE: deauthentication request and notification; like
 *	NL80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE but for Deauthentication frames (similar to
 *	MLME-DEAUTHENTICATION.request and MLME-DEAUTHENTICATE.indication
 *	primitives).
 * @NL80211_CMD_DISASSOCIATE: disassociation request and notification; like
 *	NL80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE but for Disassociation frames (similar to
 *	MLME-DISASSOCIATE.request and MLME-DISASSOCIATE.indication primitives).
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_MICHAEL_MIC_FAILURE: notification of a locally detected Michael
 *	MIC (part of TKIP) failure; sent on the "mlme" multicast group; the
 *	event includes %NL80211_ATTR_MAC to describe the source MAC address of
 *	the frame with invalid MIC, %NL80211_ATTR_KEY_TYPE to show the key
 *	type, %NL80211_ATTR_KEY_IDX to indicate the key identifier, and
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_KEY_SEQ to indicate the TSC value of the frame; this
 *	event matches with MLME-MICHAELMICFAILURE.indication() primitive
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_JOIN_IBSS: Join a new IBSS -- given at least an SSID and a
 *	FREQ attribute (for the initial frequency if no peer can be found)
 *	and optionally a MAC (as BSSID) and FREQ_FIXED attribute if those
 *	should be fixed rather than automatically determined. Can only be
 *	executed on a network interface that is UP, and fixed BSSID/FREQ
 *	may be rejected.
 * @NL80211_CMD_LEAVE_IBSS: Leave the IBSS -- no special arguments, the IBSS is
 *	determined by the network interface.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_MAX: highest used command number
 * @__NL80211_CMD_AFTER_LAST: internal use
