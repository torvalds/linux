/*
 * This structure defines the interface between the low-level tty
 * driver and the tty routines.  The following routines can be
 * defined; unless noted otherwise, they are optional, and can be
 * filled in with a null pointer.
 *
 * int  (*open)(struct tty_struct * tty, struct file * filp);
 *
 * 	This routine is called when a particular tty device is opened.
 * 	This routine is mandatory; if this routine is not filled in,
 * 	the attempted open will fail with ENODEV.
 *     
 * void (*close)(struct tty_struct * tty, struct file * filp);
 *
 * 	This routine is called when a particular tty device is closed.
 *
 * int (*write)(struct tty_struct * tty,
 * 		 const unsigned char *buf, int count);
 *
 * 	This routine is called by the kernel to write a series of
 * 	characters to the tty device.  The characters may come from
 * 	user space or kernel space.  This routine will return the
 *	number of characters actually accepted for writing.  This
 *	routine is mandatory.
 *
 * void (*put_char)(struct tty_struct *tty, unsigned char ch);
 *
 * 	This routine is called by the kernel to write a single
 * 	character to the tty device.  If the kernel uses this routine,
 * 	it must call the flush_chars() routine (if defined) when it is
 * 	done stuffing characters into the driver.  If there is no room
 * 	in the queue, the character is ignored.
 *
 * void (*flush_chars)(struct tty_struct *tty);
 *
 * 	This routine is called by the kernel after it has written a
 * 	series of characters to the tty device using put_char().  
 * 
 * int  (*write_room)(struct tty_struct *tty);
 *
 * 	This routine returns the numbers of characters the tty driver
 * 	will accept for queuing to be written.  This number is subject
 * 	to change as output buffers get emptied, or if the output flow
 *	control is acted.
 * 
 * int  (*ioctl)(struct tty_struct *tty, struct file * file,
 * 	    unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);
 *
 * 	This routine allows the tty driver to implement
 *	device-specific ioctl's.  If the ioctl number passed in cmd
 * 	is not recognized by the driver, it should return ENOIOCTLCMD.
 * 
 * void (*set_termios)(struct tty_struct *tty, struct termios * old);
 *
 * 	This routine allows the tty driver to be notified when
 * 	device's termios settings have changed.  Note that a
 * 	well-designed tty driver should be prepared to accept the case
 * 	where old == NULL, and try to do something rational.
 *
 * void (*set_ldisc)(struct tty_struct *tty);
 *
 * 	This routine allows the tty driver to be notified when the
 * 	device's termios settings have changed.
 * 
 * void (*throttle)(struct tty_struct * tty);
 *
 * 	This routine notifies the tty driver that input buffers for
 * 	the line discipline are close to full, and it should somehow
 * 	signal that no more characters should be sent to the tty.
 * 
 * void (*unthrottle)(struct tty_struct * tty);
 *
 * 	This routine notifies the tty drivers that it should signals
 * 	that characters can now be sent to the tty without fear of
 * 	overrunning the input buffers of the line disciplines.
 * 
 * void (*stop)(struct tty_struct *tty);
 *
 * 	This routine notifies the tty driver that it should stop
 * 	outputting characters to the tty device.  
 * 
 * void (*start)(struct tty_struct *tty);
 *
 * 	This routine notifies the tty driver that it resume sending
 *	characters to the tty device.
 * 
 * void (*hangup)(struct tty_struct *tty);
 *
 * 	This routine notifies the tty driver that it should hangup the
 * 	tty device.
 *
 * void (*break_ctl)(struct tty_stuct *tty, int state);
 *
 * 	This optional routine requests the tty driver to turn on or
 * 	off BREAK status on the RS-232 port.  If state is -1,
 * 	then the BREAK status should be turned on; if state is 0, then
 * 	BREAK should be turned off.
 *
 * 	If this routine is implemented, the high-level tty driver will
 * 	handle the following ioctls: TCSBRK, TCSBRKP, TIOCSBRK,
 * 	TIOCCBRK.  Otherwise, these ioctls will be passed down to the
 * 	driver to handle.
 *
 * void (*wait_until_sent)(struct tty_struct *tty, int timeout);
 * 
 * 	This routine waits until the device has written out all of the
 * 	characters in its transmitter FIFO.
 *
 * void (*send_xchar)(struct tty_struct *tty, char ch);
 *
 * 	This routine is used to send a high-priority XON/XOFF
 * 	character to the device.

 * tty driver flags
 * 
 * TTY_DRIVER_RESET_TERMIOS --- requests the tty layer to reset the
 * 	termios setting when the last process has closed the device.
 * 	Used for PTY's, in particular.
 * 
 * TTY_DRIVER_REAL_RAW --- if set, indicates that the driver will
 * 	guarantee never not to set any special character handling
 * 	flags if ((IGNBRK || (!BRKINT && !PARMRK)) && (IGNPAR ||
 * 	!INPCK)).  That is, if there is no reason for the driver to
 * 	send notifications of parity and break characters up to the
 * 	line driver, it won't do so.  This allows the line driver to
 *	optimize for this case if this flag is set.  (Note that there
 * 	is also a promise, if the above case is true, not to signal
 * 	overruns, either.)
 *
 * TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_DEV --- if set, the individual tty devices need
 *	to be registered with a call to tty_register_driver() when the
 *	device is found in the system and unregistered with a call to
 *	tty_unregister_device() so the devices will be show up
 *	properly in sysfs.  If not set, driver->num entries will be
 *	created by the tty core in sysfs when tty_register_driver() is
 *	called.  This is to be used by drivers that have tty devices
 *	that can appear and disappear while the main tty driver is
 *	registered with the tty core.
 *
 * TTY_DRIVER_DEVPTS_MEM -- don't use the standard arrays, instead
 *	use dynamic memory keyed through the devpts filesystem.  This
 *	is only applicable to the pty driver.
