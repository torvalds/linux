/**
 * struct dw_mci - MMC controller state shared between all slots
 * @lock: Spinlock protecting the queue and associated data.
 * @regs: Pointer to MMIO registers.
 * @sg: Scatterlist entry currently being processed by PIO code, if any.
 * @sg_miter: PIO mapping scatterlist iterator.
 * @cur_slot: The slot which is currently using the controller.
 * @mrq: The request currently being processed on @cur_slot,
 *	or NULL if the controller is idle.
 * @cmd: The command currently being sent to the card, or NULL.
 * @data: The data currently being transferred, or NULL if no data
 *	transfer is in progress.
 * @use_dma: Whether DMA channel is initialized or not.
 * @using_dma: Whether DMA is in use for the current transfer.
 * @sg_dma: Bus address of DMA buffer.
 * @sg_cpu: Virtual address of DMA buffer.
 * @dma_ops: Pointer to platform-specific DMA callbacks.
 * @cmd_status: Snapshot of SR taken upon completion of the current
 *	command. Only valid when EVENT_CMD_COMPLETE is pending.
 * @data_status: Snapshot of SR taken upon completion of the current
 *	data transfer. Only valid when EVENT_DATA_COMPLETE or
 *	EVENT_DATA_ERROR is pending.
 * @stop_cmdr: Value to be loaded into CMDR when the stop command is
 *	to be sent.
 * @dir_status: Direction of current transfer.
 * @tasklet: Tasklet running the request state machine.
 * @card_tasklet: Tasklet handling card detect.
 * @pending_events: Bitmask of events flagged by the interrupt handler
 *	to be processed by the tasklet.
 * @completed_events: Bitmask of events which the state machine has
 *	processed.
 * @state: Tasklet state.
 * @queue: List of slots waiting for access to the controller.
 * @bus_hz: The rate of @mck in Hz. This forms the basis for MMC bus
 *	rate and timeout calculations.
 * @current_speed: Configured rate of the controller.
 * @num_slots: Number of slots available.
 * @verid: Denote Version ID.
 * @data_offset: Set the offset of DATA register according to VERID.
 * @dev: Device associated with the MMC controller.
 * @pdata: Platform data associated with the MMC controller.
 * @drv_data: Driver specific data for identified variant of the controller
 * @priv: Implementation defined private data.
 * @biu_clk: Pointer to bus interface unit clock instance.
 * @ciu_clk: Pointer to card interface unit clock instance.
 * @slot: Slots sharing this MMC controller.
 * @fifo_depth: depth of FIFO.
 * @data_shift: log2 of FIFO item size.
 * @part_buf_start: Start index in part_buf.
 * @part_buf_count: Bytes of partial data in part_buf.
 * @part_buf: Simple buffer for partial fifo reads/writes.
 * @push_data: Pointer to FIFO push function.
 * @pull_data: Pointer to FIFO pull function.
 * @quirks: Set of quirks that apply to specific versions of the IP.
 * @irq_flags: The flags to be passed to request_irq.
 * @irq: The irq value to be passed to request_irq.
 *
 * Locking
 * =======
 *
 * @lock is a softirq-safe spinlock protecting @queue as well as
 * @cur_slot, @mrq and @state. These must always be updated
 * at the same time while holding @lock.
 *
 * The @mrq field of struct dw_mci_slot is also protected by @lock,
 * and must always be written at the same time as the slot is added to
 * @queue.
 *
 * @pending_events and @completed_events are accessed using atomic bit
 * operations, so they don't need any locking.
 *
 * None of the fields touched by the interrupt handler need any
 * locking. However, ordering is important: Before EVENT_DATA_ERROR or
 * EVENT_DATA_COMPLETE is set in @pending_events, all data-related
 * interrupts must be disabled and @data_status updated with a
 * snapshot of SR. Similarly, before EVENT_CMD_COMPLETE is set, the
 * CMDRDY interrupt must be disabled and @cmd_status updated with a
 * snapshot of SR, and before EVENT_XFER_COMPLETE can be set, the
 * bytes_xfered field of @data must be written. This is ensured by
 * using barriers.
