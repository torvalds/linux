/*
 * Notes on deprecation:
 *
 * A *major* release is a release through which all upgrades must pass
 * (e.g., jewel).  For example, no pre-jewel server will ever talk to
 * a post-jewel server (mon, osd, etc).
 *
 * For feature bits used *only* on the server-side:
 *
 *  - In the first phase we indicate that a feature is DEPRECATED as of
 *    a particular release.  This is the first major release X (say,
 *    jewel) that does not depend on its peers advertising the feature.
 *    That is, it safely assumes its peers all have the feature.  We
 *    indicate this with the DEPRECATED macro.  For example,
 *
 *      DEFINE_CEPH_FEATURE_DEPRECATED( 2, 1, MONCLOCKCHECK, JEWEL)
 *
 *    because 10.2.z (jewel) did not care if its peers advertised this
 *    feature bit.
 *
 *  - In the second phase we stop advertising the the bit and call it
 *    RETIRED.  This can normally be done in the *next* major release
 *    following the one in which we marked the feature DEPRECATED.  In
 *    the above example, for 12.0.z (luminous) we can say:
 *
 *      DEFINE_CEPH_FEATURE_RETIRED( 2, 1, MONCLOCKCHECK, JEWEL, LUMINOUS)
 *
 *  - The bit can be reused in the first post-luminous release, 13.0.z
 *    (m).
 *
 * This ensures that no two versions who have different meanings for
 * the bit ever speak to each other.
