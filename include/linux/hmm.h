/*
 * Heterogeneous Memory Management (HMM)
 *
 * See Documentation/vm/hmm.txt for reasons and overview of what HMM is and it
 * is for. Here we focus on the HMM API description, with some explanation of
 * the underlying implementation.
 *
 * Short description: HMM provides a set of helpers to share a virtual address
 * space between CPU and a device, so that the device can access any valid
 * address of the process (while still obeying memory protection). HMM also
 * provides helpers to migrate process memory to device memory, and back. Each
 * set of functionality (address space mirroring, and migration to and from
 * device memory) can be used independently of the other.
 *
 *
 * HMM address space mirroring API:
 *
 * Use HMM address space mirroring if you want to mirror range of the CPU page
 * table of a process into a device page table. Here, "mirror" means "keep
 * synchronized". Prerequisites: the device must provide the ability to write-
 * protect its page tables (at PAGE_SIZE granularity), and must be able to
 * recover from the resulting potential page faults.
 *
 * HMM guarantees that at any point in time, a given virtual address points to
 * either the same memory in both CPU and device page tables (that is: CPU and
 * device page tables each point to the same pages), or that one page table (CPU
 * or device) points to no entry, while the other still points to the old page
 * for the address. The latter case happens when the CPU page table update
 * happens first, and then the update is mirrored over to the device page table.
 * This does not cause any issue, because the CPU page table cannot start
 * pointing to a new page until the device page table is invalidated.
 *
 * HMM uses mmu_notifiers to monitor the CPU page tables, and forwards any
 * updates to each device driver that has registered a mirror. It also provides
 * some API calls to help with taking a snapshot of the CPU page table, and to
 * synchronize with any updates that might happen concurrently.
 *
 *
 * HMM migration to and from device memory:
 *
 * HMM provides a set of helpers to hotplug device memory as ZONE_DEVICE, with
 * a new MEMORY_DEVICE_PRIVATE type. This provides a struct page for each page
 * of the device memory, and allows the device driver to manage its memory
 * using those struct pages. Having struct pages for device memory makes
 * migration easier. Because that memory is not addressable by the CPU it must
 * never be pinned to the device; in other words, any CPU page fault can always
 * cause the device memory to be migrated (copied/moved) back to regular memory.
 *
 * A new migrate helper (migrate_vma()) has been added (see mm/migrate.c) that
 * allows use of a device DMA engine to perform the copy operation between
 * regular system memory and device memory.

/*
 * Mirroring: how to synchronize device page table with CPU page table.
 *
 * A device driver that is participating in HMM mirroring must always
 * synchronize with CPU page table updates. For this, device drivers can either
 * directly use mmu_notifier APIs or they can use the hmm_mirror API. Device
 * drivers can decide to register one mirror per device per process, or just
 * one mirror per process for a group of devices. The pattern is:
 *
 *      int device_bind_address_space(..., struct mm_struct *mm, ...)
 *      {
 *          struct device_address_space *das;
 *
 *          // Device driver specific initialization, and allocation of das
 *          // which contains an hmm_mirror struct as one of its fields.
 *          ...
 *
 *          ret = hmm_mirror_register(&das->mirror, mm, &device_mirror_ops);
 *          if (ret) {
 *              // Cleanup on error
 *              return ret;
 *          }
 *
 *          // Other device driver specific initialization
 *          ...
 *      }
 *
 * Once an hmm_mirror is registered for an address space, the device driver
 * will get callbacks through sync_cpu_device_pagetables() operation (see
 * hmm_mirror_ops struct).
 *
 * Device driver must not free the struct containing the hmm_mirror struct
 * before calling hmm_mirror_unregister(). The expected usage is to do that when
 * the device driver is unbinding from an address space.
 *
 *
 *      void device_unbind_address_space(struct device_address_space *das)
 *      {
 *          // Device driver specific cleanup
 *          ...
 *
 *          hmm_mirror_unregister(&das->mirror);
 *
 *          // Other device driver specific cleanup, and now das can be freed
 *          ...
