/**
 * rcu_read_lock - mark the beginning of an RCU read-side critical section.
 *
 * When synchronize_rcu() is invoked on one CPU while other CPUs
 * are within RCU read-side critical sections, then the
 * synchronize_rcu() is guaranteed to block until after all the other
 * CPUs exit their critical sections.  Similarly, if call_rcu() is invoked
 * on one CPU while other CPUs are within RCU read-side critical
 * sections, invocation of the corresponding RCU callback is deferred
 * until after the all the other CPUs exit their critical sections.
 *
 * Note, however, that RCU callbacks are permitted to run concurrently
 * with RCU read-side critical sections.  One way that this can happen
 * is via the following sequence of events: (1) CPU 0 enters an RCU
 * read-side critical section, (2) CPU 1 invokes call_rcu() to register
 * an RCU callback, (3) CPU 0 exits the RCU read-side critical section,
 * (4) CPU 2 enters a RCU read-side critical section, (5) the RCU
 * callback is invoked.  This is legal, because the RCU read-side critical
 * section that was running concurrently with the call_rcu() (and which
 * therefore might be referencing something that the corresponding RCU
 * callback would free up) has completed before the corresponding
 * RCU callback is invoked.
 *
 * RCU read-side critical sections may be nested.  Any deferred actions
 * will be deferred until the outermost RCU read-side critical section
 * completes.
 *
 * It is illegal to block while in an RCU read-side critical section.
