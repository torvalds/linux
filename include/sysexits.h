/*
 *  SYSEXITS.H -- Exit status codes for system programs.
 *
 *	This include file attempts to categorize possible error
 *	exit statuses for system programs, notably delivermail
 *	and the Berkeley network.
 *
 *	Error numbers begin at EX__BASE to reduce the possibility of
 *	clashing with other exit statuses that random programs may
 *	already return.  The meaning of the codes is approximately
 *	as follows:
 *
 *	EX_USAGE -- The command was used incorrectly, e.g., with
 *		the wrong number of arguments, a bad flag, a bad
 *		syntax in a parameter, or whatever.
 *	EX_DATAERR -- The input data was incorrect in some way.
 *		This should only be used for user's data & not
 *		system files.
 *	EX_NOINPUT -- An input file (not a system file) did not
 *		exist or was not readable.  This could also include
 *		errors like "No message" to a mailer (if it cared
 *		to catch it).
 *	EX_NOUSER -- The user specified did not exist.  This might
 *		be used for mail addresses or remote logins.
 *	EX_NOHOST -- The host specified did not exist.  This is used
 *		in mail addresses or network requests.
 *	EX_UNAVAILABLE -- A service is unavailable.  This can occur
 *		if a support program or file does not exist.  This
 *		can also be used as a catchall message when something
 *		you wanted to do doesn't work, but you don't know
 *		why.
 *	EX_SOFTWARE -- An internal software error has been detected.
 *		This should be limited to non-operating system related
 *		errors as possible.
 *	EX_OSERR -- An operating system error has been detected.
 *		This is intended to be used for such things as "cannot
 *		fork", "cannot create pipe", or the like.  It includes
 *		things like getuid returning a user that does not
 *		exist in the passwd file.
 *	EX_OSFILE -- Some system file (e.g., /etc/passwd, /var/run/utmp,
 *		etc.) does not exist, cannot be opened, or has some
 *		sort of error (e.g., syntax error).
 *	EX_CANTCREAT -- A (user specified) output file cannot be
 *		created.
 *	EX_IOERR -- An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.
 *	EX_TEMPFAIL -- temporary failure, indicating something that
 *		is not really an error.  In sendmail, this means
 *		that a mailer (e.g.) could not create a connection,
 *		and the request should be reattempted later.
 *	EX_PROTOCOL -- the remote system returned something that
 *		was "not possible" during a protocol exchange.
 *	EX_NOPERM -- You did not have sufficient permission to
 *		perform the operation.  This is not intended for
 *		file system problems, which should use EX_NOINPUT or
 *		EX_CANTCREAT, but rather for higher level permissions.
 *	EX_CONFIG -- Something was found in an unconfigured or
 *		misconfigured state.
