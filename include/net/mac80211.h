/**
 * DOC: Introduction
 *
 * mac80211 is the Linux stack for 802.11 hardware that implements
 * only partial functionality in hard- or firmware. This document
 * defines the interface between mac80211 and low-level hardware
 * drivers.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Calling mac80211 from interrupts
 *
 * Only ieee80211_tx_status_irqsafe() and ieee80211_rx_irqsafe() can be
 * called in hardware interrupt context. The low-level driver must not call any
 * other functions in hardware interrupt context. If there is a need for such
 * call, the low-level driver should first ACK the interrupt and perform the
 * IEEE 802.11 code call after this, e.g. from a scheduled workqueue or even
 * tasklet function.
 *
 * NOTE: If the driver opts to use the _irqsafe() functions, it may not also
 *	 use the non-IRQ-safe functions!
 */

/**
 * DOC: Warning
 *
 * If you're reading this document and not the header file itself, it will
 * be incomplete because not all documentation has been converted yet.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Frame format
 *
 * As a general rule, when frames are passed between mac80211 and the driver,
 * they start with the IEEE 802.11 header and include the same octets that are
 * sent over the air except for the FCS which should be calculated by the
 * hardware.
 *
 * There are, however, various exceptions to this rule for advanced features:
 *
 * The first exception is for hardware encryption and decryption offload
 * where the IV/ICV may or may not be generated in hardware.
 *
 * Secondly, when the hardware handles fragmentation, the frame handed to
 * the driver from mac80211 is the MSDU, not the MPDU.
 *
 * Finally, for received frames, the driver is able to indicate that it has
 * filled a radiotap header and put that in front of the frame; if it does
 * not do so then mac80211 may add this under certain circumstances.

 *
 * The set_key() callback in the &struct ieee80211_ops for a given
 * device is called to enable hardware acceleration of encryption and
 * decryption. The callback takes a @sta parameter that will be NULL
 * for default keys or keys used for transmission only, or point to
 * the station information for the peer for individual keys.
 * Multiple transmission keys with the same key index may be used when
 * VLANs are configured for an access point.
 *
 * When transmitting, the TX control data will use the @hw_key_idx
 * selected by the driver by modifying the &struct ieee80211_key_conf
 * pointed to by the @key parameter to the set_key() function.
 *
 * The set_key() call for the %SET_KEY command should return 0 if
 * the key is now in use, -%EOPNOTSUPP or -%ENOSPC if it couldn't be
 * added; if you return 0 then hw_key_idx must be assigned to the
 * hardware key index, you are free to use the full u8 range.
 *
 * When the cmd is %DISABLE_KEY then it must succeed.
 *
 * Note that it is permissible to not decrypt a frame even if a key
 * for it has been uploaded to hardware, the stack will not make any
 * decision based on whether a key has been uploaded or not but rather
 * based on the receive flags.
 *
 * The &struct ieee80211_key_conf structure pointed to by the @key
 * parameter is guaranteed to be valid until another call to set_key()
 * removes it, but it can only be used as a cookie to differentiate
 * keys.
 *
 * In TKIP some HW need to be provided a phase 1 key, for RX decryption
 * acceleration (i.e. iwlwifi). Those drivers should provide update_tkip_key
 * handler.
 * The update_tkip_key() call updates the driver with the new phase 1 key.
 * This happens everytime the iv16 wraps around (every 65536 packets). The
 * set_key() call will happen only once for each key (unless the AP did
 * rekeying), it will not include a valid phase 1 key. The valid phase 1 key is
 * provided by update_tkip_key only. The trigger that makes mac80211 call this
 * handler is software decryption with wrap around of iv16.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Powersave support
 *
 * mac80211 has support for various powersave implementations.
 *
 * First, it can support hardware that handles all powersaving by
 * itself, such hardware should simply set the %IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS
 * hardware flag. In that case, it will be told about the desired
 * powersave mode depending on the association status, and the driver
 * must take care of sending nullfunc frames when necessary, i.e. when
 * entering and leaving powersave mode. The driver is required to look at
 * the AID in beacons and signal to the AP that it woke up when it finds
 * traffic directed to it. This mode supports dynamic PS by simply
 * enabling/disabling PS.
 *
 * Additionally, such hardware may set the %IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_DYNAMIC_PS
 * flag to indicate that it can support dynamic PS mode itself (see below).
 *
 * Other hardware designs cannot send nullfunc frames by themselves and also
 * need software support for parsing the TIM bitmap. This is also supported
 * by mac80211 by combining the %IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS and
 * %IEEE80211_HW_PS_NULLFUNC_STACK flags. The hardware is of course still
 * required to pass up beacons. The hardware is still required to handle
 * waking up for multicast traffic; if it cannot the driver must handle that
 * as best as it can, mac80211 is too slow.
 *
 * Dynamic powersave mode is an extension to normal powersave mode in which
 * the hardware stays awake for a user-specified period of time after sending
 * a frame so that reply frames need not be buffered and therefore delayed
 * to the next wakeup. This can either be supported by hardware, in which case
 * the driver needs to look at the @dynamic_ps_timeout hardware configuration
 * value, or by the stack if all nullfunc handling is in the stack.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Beacon filter support
 *
 * Some hardware have beacon filter support to reduce host cpu wakeups
 * which will reduce system power consumption. It usuallly works so that
 * the firmware creates a checksum of the beacon but omits all constantly
 * changing elements (TSF, TIM etc). Whenever the checksum changes the
 * beacon is forwarded to the host, otherwise it will be just dropped. That
 * way the host will only receive beacons where some relevant information
 * (for example ERP protection or WMM settings) have changed.
 *
 * Beacon filter support is advertised with the %IEEE80211_HW_BEACON_FILTER
 * hardware capability. The driver needs to enable beacon filter support
 * whenever power save is enabled, that is %IEEE80211_CONF_PS is set. When
 * power save is enabled, the stack will not check for beacon loss and the
 * driver needs to notify about loss of beacons with ieee80211_beacon_loss().
 *
 * The time (or number of beacons missed) until the firmware notifies the
 * driver of a beacon loss event (which in turn causes the driver to call
 * ieee80211_beacon_loss()) should be configurable and will be controlled
 * by mac80211 and the roaming algorithm in the future.
 *
 * Since there may be constantly changing information elements that nothing
 * in the software stack cares about, we will, in the future, have mac80211
 * tell the driver which information elements are interesting in the sense
 * that we want to see changes in them. This will include
 *  - a list of information element IDs
 *  - a list of OUIs for the vendor information element
 *
 * Ideally, the hardware would filter out any beacons without changes in the
 * requested elements, but if it cannot support that it may, at the expense
 * of some efficiency, filter out only a subset. For example, if the device
 * doesn't support checking for OUIs it should pass up all changes in all
 * vendor information elements.
 *
 * Note that change, for the sake of simplification, also includes information
 * elements appearing or disappearing from the beacon.
 *
 * Some hardware supports an "ignore list" instead, just make sure nothing
 * that was requested is on the ignore list, and include commonly changing
 * information element IDs in the ignore list, for example 11 (BSS load) and
 * the various vendor-assigned IEs with unknown contents (128, 129, 133-136,
 * 149, 150, 155, 156, 173, 176, 178, 179, 219); for forward compatibility
 * it could also include some currently unused IDs.
 *
 *
 * In addition to these capabilities, hardware should support notifying the
 * host of changes in the beacon RSSI. This is relevant to implement roaming
 * when no traffic is flowing (when traffic is flowing we see the RSSI of
 * the received data packets). This can consist in notifying the host when
 * the RSSI changes significantly or when it drops below or rises above
 * configurable thresholds. In the future these thresholds will also be
 * configured by mac80211 (which gets them from userspace) to implement
 * them as the roaming algorithm requires.
 *
 * If the hardware cannot implement this, the driver should ask it to
 * periodically pass beacon frames to the host so that software can do the
 * signal strength threshold checking.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Frame filtering
 *
 * mac80211 requires to see many management frames for proper
 * operation, and users may want to see many more frames when
 * in monitor mode. However, for best CPU usage and power consumption,
 * having as few frames as possible percolate through the stack is
 * desirable. Hence, the hardware should filter as much as possible.
 *
 * To achieve this, mac80211 uses filter flags (see below) to tell
 * the driver's configure_filter() function which frames should be
 * passed to mac80211 and which should be filtered out.
 *
 * The configure_filter() callback is invoked with the parameters
 * @mc_count and @mc_list for the combined multicast address list
 * of all virtual interfaces, @changed_flags telling which flags
 * were changed and @total_flags with the new flag states.
 *
 * If your device has no multicast address filters your driver will
 * need to check both the %FIF_ALLMULTI flag and the @mc_count
 * parameter to see whether multicast frames should be accepted
 * or dropped.
 *
 * All unsupported flags in @total_flags must be cleared.
 * Hardware does not support a flag if it is incapable of _passing_
 * the frame to the stack. Otherwise the driver must ignore
 * the flag, but not clear it.
 * You must _only_ clear the flag (announce no support for the
 * flag to mac80211) if you are not able to pass the packet type
 * to the stack (so the hardware always filters it).
 * So for example, you should clear @FIF_CONTROL, if your hardware
 * always filters control frames. If your hardware always passes
 * control frames to the kernel and is incapable of filtering them,
 * you do _not_ clear the @FIF_CONTROL flag.
 * This rule applies to all other FIF flags as well.

/**
 * struct ieee80211_ops - callbacks from mac80211 to the driver
 *
 * This structure contains various callbacks that the driver may
 * handle or, in some cases, must handle, for example to configure
 * the hardware to a new channel or to transmit a frame.
 *
 * @tx: Handler that 802.11 module calls for each transmitted frame.
 *	skb contains the buffer starting from the IEEE 802.11 header.
 *	The low-level driver should send the frame out based on
 *	configuration in the TX control data. This handler should,
 *	preferably, never fail and stop queues appropriately, more
 *	importantly, however, it must never fail for A-MPDU-queues.
 *	This function should return NETDEV_TX_OK except in very
 *	limited cases.
 *	Must be implemented and atomic.
 *
 * @start: Called before the first netdevice attached to the hardware
 *	is enabled. This should turn on the hardware and must turn on
 *	frame reception (for possibly enabled monitor interfaces.)
 *	Returns negative error codes, these may be seen in userspace,
 *	or zero.
 *	When the device is started it should not have a MAC address
 *	to avoid acknowledging frames before a non-monitor device
 *	is added.
 *	Must be implemented.
 *
 * @stop: Called after last netdevice attached to the hardware
 *	is disabled. This should turn off the hardware (at least
 *	it must turn off frame reception.)
 *	May be called right after add_interface if that rejects
 *	an interface.
 *	Must be implemented.
 *
 * @add_interface: Called when a netdevice attached to the hardware is
 *	enabled. Because it is not called for monitor mode devices, @start
 *	and @stop must be implemented.
 *	The driver should perform any initialization it needs before
 *	the device can be enabled. The initial configuration for the
 *	interface is given in the conf parameter.
 *	The callback may refuse to add an interface by returning a
 *	negative error code (which will be seen in userspace.)
 *	Must be implemented.
 *
 * @remove_interface: Notifies a driver that an interface is going down.
 *	The @stop callback is called after this if it is the last interface
 *	and no monitor interfaces are present.
 *	When all interfaces are removed, the MAC address in the hardware
 *	must be cleared so the device no longer acknowledges packets,
 *	the mac_addr member of the conf structure is, however, set to the
 *	MAC address of the device going away.
 *	Hence, this callback must be implemented.
 *
 * @config: Handler for configuration requests. IEEE 802.11 code calls this
 *	function to change hardware configuration, e.g., channel.
 *	This function should never fail but returns a negative error code
 *	if it does.
 *
 * @bss_info_changed: Handler for configuration requests related to BSS
 *	parameters that may vary during BSS's lifespan, and may affect low
 *	level driver (e.g. assoc/disassoc status, erp parameters).
 *	This function should not be used if no BSS has been set, unless
 *	for association indication. The @changed parameter indicates which
 *	of the bss parameters has changed when a call is made.
 *
 * @configure_filter: Configure the device's RX filter.
 *	See the section "Frame filtering" for more information.
 *	This callback must be implemented and atomic.
 *
 * @set_tim: Set TIM bit. mac80211 calls this function when a TIM bit
 * 	must be set or cleared for a given STA. Must be atomic.
 *
 * @set_key: See the section "Hardware crypto acceleration"
 *	This callback can sleep, and is only called between add_interface
 *	and remove_interface calls, i.e. while the given virtual interface
 *	is enabled.
 *	Returns a negative error code if the key can't be added.
 *
 * @update_tkip_key: See the section "Hardware crypto acceleration"
 * 	This callback will be called in the context of Rx. Called for drivers
 * 	which set IEEE80211_KEY_FLAG_TKIP_REQ_RX_P1_KEY.
 *
 * @hw_scan: Ask the hardware to service the scan request, no need to start
 *	the scan state machine in stack. The scan must honour the channel
 *	configuration done by the regulatory agent in the wiphy's
 *	registered bands. The hardware (or the driver) needs to make sure
 *	that power save is disabled.
 *	The @req ie/ie_len members are rewritten by mac80211 to contain the
 *	entire IEs after the SSID, so that drivers need not look at these
 *	at all but just send them after the SSID -- mac80211 includes the
 *	(extended) supported rates and HT information (where applicable).
 *	When the scan finishes, ieee80211_scan_completed() must be called;
 *	note that it also must be called when the scan cannot finish due to
 *	any error unless this callback returned a negative error code.
 *
 * @sw_scan_start: Notifier function that is called just before a software scan
 *	is started. Can be NULL, if the driver doesn't need this notification.
 *
 * @sw_scan_complete: Notifier function that is called just after a software scan
 *	finished. Can be NULL, if the driver doesn't need this notification.
 *
 * @get_stats: Return low-level statistics.
 * 	Returns zero if statistics are available.
 *
 * @get_tkip_seq: If your device implements TKIP encryption in hardware this
 *	callback should be provided to read the TKIP transmit IVs (both IV32
 *	and IV16) for the given key from hardware.
 *
 * @set_rts_threshold: Configuration of RTS threshold (if device needs it)
 *
 * @sta_notify: Notifies low level driver about addition, removal or power
 *	state transition of an associated station, AP,  IBSS/WDS/mesh peer etc.
 *	Must be atomic.
 *
 * @conf_tx: Configure TX queue parameters (EDCF (aifs, cw_min, cw_max),
 *	bursting) for a hardware TX queue.
 *	Returns a negative error code on failure.
 *
 * @get_tx_stats: Get statistics of the current TX queue status. This is used
 *	to get number of currently queued packets (queue length), maximum queue
 *	size (limit), and total number of packets sent using each TX queue
 *	(count). The 'stats' pointer points to an array that has hw->queues
 *	items.
 *
 * @get_tsf: Get the current TSF timer value from firmware/hardware. Currently,
 *	this is only used for IBSS mode BSSID merging and debugging. Is not a
 *	required function.
 *
 * @set_tsf: Set the TSF timer to the specified value in the firmware/hardware.
 *      Currently, this is only used for IBSS mode debugging. Is not a
 *	required function.
 *
 * @reset_tsf: Reset the TSF timer and allow firmware/hardware to synchronize
 *	with other STAs in the IBSS. This is only used in IBSS mode. This
 *	function is optional if the firmware/hardware takes full care of
 *	TSF synchronization.
 *
 * @tx_last_beacon: Determine whether the last IBSS beacon was sent by us.
 *	This is needed only for IBSS mode and the result of this function is
 *	used to determine whether to reply to Probe Requests.
 *	Returns non-zero if this device sent the last beacon.
 *
 * @ampdu_action: Perform a certain A-MPDU action
 * 	The RA/TID combination determines the destination and TID we want
 * 	the ampdu action to be performed for. The action is defined through
 * 	ieee80211_ampdu_mlme_action. Starting sequence number (@ssn)
 * 	is the first frame we expect to perform the action on. Notice
 * 	that TX/RX_STOP can pass NULL for this parameter.
 *	Returns a negative error code on failure.
 *
 * @rfkill_poll: Poll rfkill hardware state. If you need this, you also
 *	need to set wiphy->rfkill_poll to %true before registration,
 *	and need to call wiphy_rfkill_set_hw_state() in the callback.
