Usage: compile [--help] [--version] PROGRAM [ARGS]

Wrapper for compilers which do not understand '-c -o'.
Remove '-o dest.o' from ARGS, run PROGRAM with the remaining
arguments, and rename the output as expected.

If you are trying to build a whole package this is not the
right script to run: please start by reading the file 'INSTALL'.
