DESCRIPTION
        Return TRUE if the core file attached to @var{core_bfd}
        was generated by a run of the executable file attached
        to @var{exec_bfd}.  The match is based on executable
        basenames only.

        Note: When not able to determine the core file failing
        command or the executable name, we still return TRUE even
        though we're not sure that core file and executable match.
        This is to avoid generating a false warning in situations
        where we really don't know whether they match or not.
