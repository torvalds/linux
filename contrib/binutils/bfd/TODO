Things that still need to be done: -*- Text -*-

 o - A source of space lossage is that all the target-dependent code
     is in a single bfd_target structure.  Hence all the code for
     *writing* object files is still pulled into all the applications
     that only care about *reading* (gdb, nm, objdump), while gas has
     to carry along all the unneeded baggage for reading objects.  And
     so on.  This would be a substantial change, and the payoff would
     not all that great (essentially none if bfd is used as a shared
     library).

 o - The storage needed by BFD data structures is also larger than strictly
     needed.  This may be difficult to do much about.

 o - implement bfd_abort, which should close the bfd but not alter the
     filesystem.

 o - update the bfd doc; write a how-to-write-a-backend doc, take out
     the stupid quips and fill in all the blanks.

 o - upgrade the reloc handling as per Steve's suggestion.
