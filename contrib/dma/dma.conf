# Your smarthost (also called relayhost).  Leave blank if you don't want

# NOTE: on Debian systems this is handled via debconf!
# Please use dpkg-reconfigure dma to change this value.

# Use this SMTP port.  Most users will be fine with the default (25)
#PORT 25

# Path to your alias file.  Just stay with the default.
#ALIASES /etc/aliases

# Path to your spooldir.  Just stay with the default.

# Uncomment if yout want TLS/SSL support
#SECURETRANSFER

# Uncomment if you want STARTTLS support (only used in combination with
# SECURETRANSFER)

# to fail ("opportunistic TLS", use an encrypted connection when available
# but allow an unencrypted one to servers that do not support it)
#OPPORTUNISTIC_TLS

# Path to your local SSL certificate
#CERTFILE

# If you want to use plain text SMTP login without using encryption, change
# the SECURE entry below to INSECURE.  Otherwise plain login will only work
# over a secure connection.  Use this option with caution.
#SECURE

# Uncomment if you want to defer your mails.  This is useful if you are
# behind a dialup line.  You have to submit your mails manually with dma -q

#FULLBOUNCE

# The internet hostname dma uses to identify the host.
# If not set or empty, the result of gethostname(2) is used.
# If MAILNAME is an absolute path to a file, the first line of this file
# will be used as the hostname.
#MAILNAME mail.example.net

# Masquerade envelope from addresses with this address/hostname.
# Use this if mails are not accepted by destination mail servers because
# your sender domain is invalid.
# By default, MASQUERADE is not set.
# Format: MASQUERADE [user@][host]
# Examples:
# MASQUERADE john@  on host "hamlet" will send all mails as john@hamlet
# MASQUERADE percolator  will send mails as $username@percolator, e.g. fish@percolator
# MASQUERADE herb@ert  will send all mails as herb@ert

# Directly forward the mail to the SMARTHOST bypassing aliases and local delivery
