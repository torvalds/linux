.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.SS "Standard API"
.PP
The
malloc()
function allocates
\fIsize\fR
bytes of uninitialized memory\&. The allocated space is suitably aligned (after possible pointer coercion) for storage of any type of object\&.
.PP
The
calloc()
function allocates space for
\fInumber\fR
objects, each
\fIsize\fR
bytes in length\&. The result is identical to calling
malloc()
with an argument of
\fInumber\fR
*
\fIsize\fR, with the exception that the allocated memory is explicitly initialized to zero bytes\&.
.PP
The
posix_memalign()
function allocates
\fIsize\fR
bytes of memory such that the allocation\*(Aqs base address is a multiple of
\fIalignment\fR, and returns the allocation in the value pointed to by
\fIptr\fR\&. The requested
\fIalignment\fR
must be a power of 2 at least as large as
sizeof(\fBvoid *\fR)\&.
.PP
The
aligned_alloc()
function allocates
\fIsize\fR
bytes of memory such that the allocation\*(Aqs base address is a multiple of
\fIalignment\fR\&. The requested
\fIalignment\fR
must be a power of 2\&. Behavior is undefined if
\fIsize\fR
is not an integral multiple of
\fIalignment\fR\&.
.PP
The
realloc()
function changes the size of the previously allocated memory referenced by
\fIptr\fR
to
\fIsize\fR
bytes\&. The contents of the memory are unchanged up to the lesser of the new and old sizes\&. If the new size is larger, the contents of the newly allocated portion of the memory are undefined\&. Upon success, the memory referenced by
\fIptr\fR
is freed and a pointer to the newly allocated memory is returned\&. Note that
realloc()
may move the memory allocation, resulting in a different return value than
\fIptr\fR\&. If
\fIptr\fR
is
\fBNULL\fR, the
realloc()
function behaves identically to
malloc()
for the specified size\&.
.PP
The
free()
function causes the allocated memory referenced by
\fIptr\fR
to be made available for future allocations\&. If
\fIptr\fR
is
\fBNULL\fR, no action occurs\&.
.SS "Non\-standard API"
.PP
The
mallocx(),
rallocx(),
xallocx(),
sallocx(),
dallocx(),
sdallocx(), and
nallocx()
functions all have a
\fIflags\fR
argument that can be used to specify options\&. The functions only check the options that are contextually relevant\&. Use bitwise or (|) operations to specify one or more of the following:
.PP
\fBMALLOCX_LG_ALIGN(\fR\fB\fIla\fR\fR\fB) \fR
.RS 4
Align the memory allocation to start at an address that is a multiple of
(1 << \fIla\fR)\&. This macro does not validate that
\fIla\fR
is within the valid range\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMALLOCX_ALIGN(\fR\fB\fIa\fR\fR\fB) \fR
.RS 4
Align the memory allocation to start at an address that is a multiple of
\fIa\fR, where
\fIa\fR
is a power of two\&. This macro does not validate that
\fIa\fR
is a power of 2\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMALLOCX_ZERO\fR
.RS 4
Initialize newly allocated memory to contain zero bytes\&. In the growing reallocation case, the real size prior to reallocation defines the boundary between untouched bytes and those that are initialized to contain zero bytes\&. If this macro is absent, newly allocated memory is uninitialized\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMALLOCX_TCACHE(\fR\fB\fItc\fR\fR\fB) \fR
.RS 4
Use the thread\-specific cache (tcache) specified by the identifier
\fItc\fR, which must have been acquired via the
tcache\&.create
mallctl\&. This macro does not validate that
\fItc\fR
specifies a valid identifier\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMALLOCX_TCACHE_NONE\fR
.RS 4
Do not use a thread\-specific cache (tcache)\&. Unless
\fBMALLOCX_TCACHE(\fR\fB\fItc\fR\fR\fB)\fR
or
\fBMALLOCX_TCACHE_NONE\fR
is specified, an automatically managed tcache will be used under many circumstances\&. This macro cannot be used in the same
\fIflags\fR
argument as
\fBMALLOCX_TCACHE(\fR\fB\fItc\fR\fR\fB)\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBMALLOCX_ARENA(\fR\fB\fIa\fR\fR\fB) \fR
.RS 4
Use the arena specified by the index
\fIa\fR\&. This macro has no effect for regions that were allocated via an arena other than the one specified\&. This macro does not validate that
\fIa\fR
specifies an arena index in the valid range\&.
.RE
.PP
The
mallocx()
function allocates at least
\fIsize\fR
bytes of memory, and returns a pointer to the base address of the allocation\&. Behavior is undefined if
\fIsize\fR
is
\fB0\fR\&.
.PP
The
rallocx()
function resizes the allocation at
\fIptr\fR
to be at least
\fIsize\fR
bytes, and returns a pointer to the base address of the resulting allocation, which may or may not have moved from its original location\&. Behavior is undefined if
\fIsize\fR
is
\fB0\fR\&.
.PP
The
xallocx()
function resizes the allocation at
\fIptr\fR
in place to be at least
\fIsize\fR
bytes, and returns the real size of the allocation\&. If
\fIextra\fR
is non\-zero, an attempt is made to resize the allocation to be at least
(\fIsize\fR + \fIextra\fR)
bytes, though inability to allocate the extra byte(s) will not by itself result in failure to resize\&. Behavior is undefined if
\fIsize\fR
is
\fB0\fR, or if
(\fIsize\fR + \fIextra\fR > \fBSIZE_T_MAX\fR)\&.
.PP
The
sallocx()
function returns the real size of the allocation at
\fIptr\fR\&.
.PP
The
dallocx()
function causes the memory referenced by
\fIptr\fR
to be made available for future allocations\&.
.PP
The
sdallocx()
function is an extension of
dallocx()
with a
\fIsize\fR
parameter to allow the caller to pass in the allocation size as an optimization\&. The minimum valid input size is the original requested size of the allocation, and the maximum valid input size is the corresponding value returned by
nallocx()
or
sallocx()\&.
.PP
The
nallocx()
function allocates no memory, but it performs the same size computation as the
mallocx()
function, and returns the real size of the allocation that would result from the equivalent
mallocx()
function call, or
\fB0\fR
if the inputs exceed the maximum supported size class and/or alignment\&. Behavior is undefined if
\fIsize\fR
is
\fB0\fR\&.
.PP
The
mallctl()
function provides a general interface for introspecting the memory allocator, as well as setting modifiable parameters and triggering actions\&. The period\-separated
\fIname\fR
argument specifies a location in a tree\-structured namespace; see the
MALLCTL NAMESPACE
section for documentation on the tree contents\&. To read a value, pass a pointer via
\fIoldp\fR
to adequate space to contain the value, and a pointer to its length via
\fIoldlenp\fR; otherwise pass
\fBNULL\fR
and
\fBNULL\fR\&. Similarly, to write a value, pass a pointer to the value via
\fInewp\fR, and its length via
\fInewlen\fR; otherwise pass
\fBNULL\fR
and
\fB0\fR\&.
.PP
The
mallctlnametomib()
function provides a way to avoid repeated name lookups for applications that repeatedly query the same portion of the namespace, by translating a name to a
\(lqManagement Information Base\(rq
(MIB) that can be passed repeatedly to
mallctlbymib()\&. Upon successful return from
mallctlnametomib(),
\fImibp\fR
contains an array of
\fI*miblenp\fR
integers, where
\fI*miblenp\fR
is the lesser of the number of components in
\fIname\fR
and the input value of
\fI*miblenp\fR\&. Thus it is possible to pass a
\fI*miblenp\fR
that is smaller than the number of period\-separated name components, which results in a partial MIB that can be used as the basis for constructing a complete MIB\&. For name components that are integers (e\&.g\&. the 2 in
arenas\&.bin\&.2\&.size), the corresponding MIB component will always be that integer\&. Therefore, it is legitimate to construct code like the following:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
unsigned nbins, i;
size_t mib[4];
size_t len, miblen;

len = sizeof(nbins);
mallctl("arenas\&.nbins", &nbins, &len, NULL, 0);

miblen = 4;
mallctlnametomib("arenas\&.bin\&.0\&.size", mib, &miblen);
for (i = 0; i < nbins; i++) {
	size_t bin_size;

	mib[2] = i;
	len = sizeof(bin_size);
	mallctlbymib(mib, miblen, (void *)&bin_size, &len, NULL, 0);
	/* Do something with bin_size\&.\&.\&. */
}
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
.RS 4
.RE
.PP
The
malloc_stats_print()
function writes summary statistics via the
\fIwrite_cb\fR
callback function pointer and
\fIcbopaque\fR
data passed to
\fIwrite_cb\fR, or
malloc_message()
if
\fIwrite_cb\fR
is
\fBNULL\fR\&. The statistics are presented in human\-readable form unless
\(lqJ\(rq
is specified as a character within the
\fIopts\fR
string, in which case the statistics are presented in
\m[blue]\fBJSON format\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&. This function can be called repeatedly\&. General information that never changes during execution can be omitted by specifying
\(lqg\(rq
as a character within the
\fIopts\fR
string\&. Note that
malloc_message()
uses the
mallctl*()
functions internally, so inconsistent statistics can be reported if multiple threads use these functions simultaneously\&. If
\fB\-\-enable\-stats\fR
is specified during configuration,
\(lqm\(rq,
\(lqd\(rq, and
\(lqa\(rq
can be specified to omit merged arena, destroyed merged arena, and per arena statistics, respectively;
\(lqb\(rq
and
\(lql\(rq
can be specified to omit per size class statistics for bins and large objects, respectively;
\(lqx\(rq
can be specified to omit all mutex statistics\&. Unrecognized characters are silently ignored\&. Note that thread caching may prevent some statistics from being completely up to date, since extra locking would be required to merge counters that track thread cache operations\&.
.PP
The
malloc_usable_size()
function returns the usable size of the allocation pointed to by
\fIptr\fR\&. The return value may be larger than the size that was requested during allocation\&. The
malloc_usable_size()
function is not a mechanism for in\-place
realloc(); rather it is provided solely as a tool for introspection purposes\&. Any discrepancy between the requested allocation size and the size reported by
malloc_usable_size()
should not be depended on, since such behavior is entirely implementation\-dependent\&.
.SH "TUNING"
.PP
Once, when the first call is made to one of the memory allocation routines, the allocator initializes its internals based in part on various options that can be specified at compile\- or run\-time\&.
.PP
The string specified via
\fB\-\-with\-malloc\-conf\fR, the string pointed to by the global variable
\fImalloc_conf\fR, the
\(lqname\(rq
of the file referenced by the symbolic link named
/etc/malloc\&.conf, and the value of the environment variable
\fBMALLOC_CONF\fR, will be interpreted, in that order, from left to right as options\&. Note that
\fImalloc_conf\fR
may be read before
main()
is entered, so the declaration of
\fImalloc_conf\fR
should specify an initializer that contains the final value to be read by jemalloc\&.
\fB\-\-with\-malloc\-conf\fR
and
\fImalloc_conf\fR
are compile\-time mechanisms, whereas
/etc/malloc\&.conf
and
\fBMALLOC_CONF\fR
can be safely set any time prior to program invocation\&.
.PP
An options string is a comma\-separated list of option:value pairs\&. There is one key corresponding to each
opt\&.*
mallctl (see the
MALLCTL NAMESPACE
section for options documentation)\&. For example,
abort:true,narenas:1
sets the
opt\&.abort
and
opt\&.narenas
options\&. Some options have boolean values (true/false), others have integer values (base 8, 10, or 16, depending on prefix), and yet others have raw string values\&.
.SH "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES"
.PP
Traditionally, allocators have used
\fBsbrk\fR(2)
to obtain memory, which is suboptimal for several reasons, including race conditions, increased fragmentation, and artificial limitations on maximum usable memory\&. If
\fBsbrk\fR(2)
is supported by the operating system, this allocator uses both
\fBmmap\fR(2)
and
\fBsbrk\fR(2), in that order of preference; otherwise only
\fBmmap\fR(2)
is used\&.
.PP
This allocator uses multiple arenas in order to reduce lock contention for threaded programs on multi\-processor systems\&. This works well with regard to threading scalability, but incurs some costs\&. There is a small fixed per\-arena overhead, and additionally, arenas manage memory completely independently of each other, which means a small fixed increase in overall memory fragmentation\&. These overheads are not generally an issue, given the number of arenas normally used\&. Note that using substantially more arenas than the default is not likely to improve performance, mainly due to reduced cache performance\&. However, it may make sense to reduce the number of arenas if an application does not make much use of the allocation functions\&.
.PP
In addition to multiple arenas, this allocator supports thread\-specific caching, in order to make it possible to completely avoid synchronization for most allocation requests\&. Such caching allows very fast allocation in the common case, but it increases memory usage and fragmentation, since a bounded number of objects can remain allocated in each thread cache\&.
.PP
Memory is conceptually broken into extents\&. Extents are always aligned to multiples of the page size\&. This alignment makes it possible to find metadata for user objects quickly\&. User objects are broken into two categories according to size: small and large\&. Contiguous small objects comprise a slab, which resides within a single extent, whereas large objects each have their own extents backing them\&.
.PP
Small objects are managed in groups by slabs\&. Each slab maintains a bitmap to track which regions are in use\&. Allocation requests that are no more than half the quantum (8 or 16, depending on architecture) are rounded up to the nearest power of two that is at least
sizeof(\fBdouble\fR)\&. All other object size classes are multiples of the quantum, spaced such that there are four size classes for each doubling in size, which limits internal fragmentation to approximately 20% for all but the smallest size classes\&. Small size classes are smaller than four times the page size, and large size classes extend from four times the page size up to the largest size class that does not exceed
\fBPTRDIFF_MAX\fR\&.
.PP
Allocations are packed tightly together, which can be an issue for multi\-threaded applications\&. If you need to assure that allocations do not suffer from cacheline sharing, round your allocation requests up to the nearest multiple of the cacheline size, or specify cacheline alignment when allocating\&.
.PP
The
realloc(),
rallocx(), and
xallocx()
functions may resize allocations without moving them under limited circumstances\&. Unlike the
*allocx()
API, the standard API does not officially round up the usable size of an allocation to the nearest size class, so technically it is necessary to call
realloc()
to grow e\&.g\&. a 9\-byte allocation to 16 bytes, or shrink a 16\-byte allocation to 9 bytes\&. Growth and shrinkage trivially succeeds in place as long as the pre\-size and post\-size both round up to the same size class\&. No other API guarantees are made regarding in\-place resizing, but the current implementation also tries to resize large allocations in place, as long as the pre\-size and post\-size are both large\&. For shrinkage to succeed, the extent allocator must support splitting (see
arena\&.<i>\&.extent_hooks)\&. Growth only succeeds if the trailing memory is currently available, and the extent allocator supports merging\&.
.PP
Assuming 4 KiB pages and a 16\-byte quantum on a 64\-bit system, the size classes in each category are as shown in
Table 1\&.

The
\fBextent_hooks_t\fR
structure comprises function pointers which are described individually below\&. jemalloc uses these functions to manage extent lifetime, which starts off with allocation of mapped committed memory, in the simplest case followed by deallocation\&. However, there are performance and platform reasons to retain extents for later reuse\&. Cleanup attempts cascade from deallocation to decommit to forced purging to lazy purging, which gives the extent management functions opportunities to reject the most permanent cleanup operations in favor of less permanent (and often less costly) operations\&. All operations except allocation can be universally opted out of by setting the hook pointers to
\fBNULL\fR, or selectively opted out of by returning failure\&. Note that once the extent hook is set, the structure is accessed directly by the associated arenas, so it must remain valid for the entire lifetime of the arenas\&.

.SH "DEBUGGING MALLOC PROBLEMS"
.PP
When debugging, it is a good idea to configure/build jemalloc with the
\fB\-\-enable\-debug\fR
and
\fB\-\-enable\-fill\fR
options, and recompile the program with suitable options and symbols for debugger support\&. When so configured, jemalloc incorporates a wide variety of run\-time assertions that catch application errors such as double\-free, write\-after\-free, etc\&.
.PP
Programs often accidentally depend on
\(lquninitialized\(rq
memory actually being filled with zero bytes\&. Junk filling (see the
opt\&.junk
option) tends to expose such bugs in the form of obviously incorrect results and/or coredumps\&. Conversely, zero filling (see the
opt\&.zero
option) eliminates the symptoms of such bugs\&. Between these two options, it is usually possible to quickly detect, diagnose, and eliminate such bugs\&.
.PP
This implementation does not provide much detail about the problems it detects, because the performance impact for storing such information would be prohibitive\&.
.SH "DIAGNOSTIC MESSAGES"
.PP
If any of the memory allocation/deallocation functions detect an error or warning condition, a message will be printed to file descriptor
\fBSTDERR_FILENO\fR\&. Errors will result in the process dumping core\&. If the
opt\&.abort
option is set, most warnings are treated as errors\&.
.PP
The
\fImalloc_message\fR
variable allows the programmer to override the function which emits the text strings forming the errors and warnings if for some reason the
\fBSTDERR_FILENO\fR
file descriptor is not suitable for this\&.
malloc_message()
takes the
\fIcbopaque\fR
pointer argument that is
\fBNULL\fR
unless overridden by the arguments in a call to
malloc_stats_print(), followed by a string pointer\&. Please note that doing anything which tries to allocate memory in this function is likely to result in a crash or deadlock\&.
.PP
All messages are prefixed by
\(lq<jemalloc>: \(rq\&.
