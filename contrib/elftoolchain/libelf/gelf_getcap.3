.Sh NAME
.Nm gelf_getcap ,
.Nm gelf_update_cap
.Nd read and update ELF capability information
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libelf
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In gelf.h
.Ft "GElf_Cap *"
.Fn gelf_getcap "Elf_Data *data" "int ndx" "GElf_Cap *cap"
.Ft int
.Fn gelf_update_cap "Elf_Data *data" "int ndx" "GElf_Cap *cap"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These convenience functions are used to retrieve and update class-dependent
.Vt Elf32_Cap
or
.Vt Elf64_Cap
information.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar data
is an
.Vt Elf_Data
descriptor associated with a section of type
.Dv SHT_SUNW_cap .
Argument
.Ar ndx
is the index of the entry being retrieved or updated.
The class-independent
.Vt GElf_Cap
structure is described in
.Xr gelf 3 .
.Pp
Function
.Fn gelf_getcap
retrieves the class-dependent entry at index
.Ar ndx
in data buffer
.Ar data
and copies it to the destination pointed to by argument
.Ar cap
after translation to class-independent form.
.Pp
Function
.Fn gelf_update_cap
converts the class-independent entry pointed to
by argument
.Ar cap
to class-dependent form, and writes it to the entry at index
.Ar ndx
in the data buffer described by argument
.Ar data .
Function
.Fn gelf_update_cap
signals an error if any of the values in the class-independent
representation exceeds the representable limits of the target
type.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Function
.Fn gelf_getcap
returns the value of argument
.Ar cap
if successful, or NULL in case of an error.
Function
.Fn gelf_update_cap
returns a non-zero value if successful, or zero in case of an error.
.Sh ERRORS
These functions may fail with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width "[ELF_E_RESOURCE]"
.It Bq Er ELF_E_ARGUMENT
Arguments
.Ar data
or
.Ar cap
were NULL.
.It Bq Er ELF_E_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Ar ndx
was less than zero or larger than the number of entries in the data
descriptor.
.It Bq Er ELF_E_ARGUMENT
Data descriptor
.Ar data
was not associated with a section of type
.Dv SHT_SUNW_cap .
.It Bq Er ELF_E_RANGE
A value was not representable in the target type.
