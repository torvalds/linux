.Nd read and update symbol information
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libelf
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In gelf.h
.Ft "GElf_Syminfo *"
.Fn gelf_getsyminfo "Elf_Data *data" "int ndx" "GElf_Syminfo *syminfo"
.Ft int
.Fn gelf_update_syminfo "Elf_Data *data" "int ndx" "GElf_Syminfo *syminfo"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These convenience functions are used to retrieve and update class-dependent
.Vt Elf32_Syminfo
and
.Vt Elf64_Syminfo
records in an ELF object.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar data
is an
.Vt Elf_Data
descriptor associated with a section of type
.Dv SHT_SUNW_syminfo .
Argument
.Ar ndx
is the index of the record being retrieved or updated.
The class-independent
.Vt GElf_Syminfo
structure is described in
.Xr gelf 3 .
.Pp
Function
.Fn gelf_getsyminfo
retrieves class-dependent record at index
.Ar ndx
in data buffer
.Ar data
and copies it to the destination pointed to by argument
.Ar syminfo
after translation to class-independent form.
.Pp
Function
.Fn gelf_update_syminfo
converts the class-independent record pointed to
by argument
.Ar syminfo
to class-dependent form, and writes it to the record at index
.Ar ndx
in the data buffer described by argument
.Ar data .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Function
.Fn gelf_getsyminfo
returns the value of argument
.Ar syminfo
if successful, or NULL in case of an error.
Function
.Fn gelf_update_syminfo
returns a non-zero value if successful, or zero in case of an error.
.Sh ERRORS
These functions may fail with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width "[ELF_E_RESOURCE]"
.It Bq Er ELF_E_ARGUMENT
Arguments
.Ar data
or
.Ar syminfo
were NULL.
.It Bq Er ELF_E_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Ar ndx
was less than zero or larger than the number of symbols in the data
descriptor.
.It Bq Er ELF_E_ARGUMENT
Data descriptor
.Ar data
was not associated with a section containing symbol information.
