.Sh NAME
.Nm elf
.Nd API for manipulating ELF objects
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libelf
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libelf.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Lb libelf
provides functions that allow an application to read and manipulate
ELF object files, and to read
.Xr ar 1
archives.
The library allows the manipulation of ELF objects in a byte ordering
and word-size independent way, allowing an application to read and
create ELF objects for 32 and 64 bit architectures and for little-
and big-endian machines.
The library is capable of processing ELF objects that use extended
section numbering.
.Pp
This manual page serves to provide an overview of the functionality in
the ELF library.
Further information may found in the manual pages for individual
.Xr ELF 3
functions that comprise the library.
.Ss ELF Concepts
As described in
.Xr elf 5 ,
ELF files contain several data structures that are laid out in a
specific way.
ELF files begin with an
.Dq Executable Header ,
and may contain an optional
.Dq Program Header Table ,
and optional data in the form of ELF
.Dq sections .
A
.Dq Section Header Table
describes the content of the data in these sections.
.Pp
ELF objects have an associated
.Dq "ELF class"
which denotes the natural machine word size for the architecture
the object is associated with.
Objects for 32 bit architectures have an ELF class of
.Dv ELFCLASS32 .
Objects for 64 bit architectures have an ELF class of
.Dv ELFCLASS64 .
.Pp
ELF objects also have an associated
.Dq endianness
which denotes the endianness of the machine architecture associated
with the object.
This may be
.Dv ELFDATA2LSB
for little-endian architectures and
.Dv ELFDATA2MSB
for big-endian architectures.
.Pp
ELF objects are also associated with an API version number.
This version number determines the layout of the individual components
of an ELF file and the semantics associated with these.
.Ss Data Representation And Translation
The
.Xr ELF 3
library distinguishes between
.Dq native
representations of ELF data structures and their
.Dq file
representations.
.Pp
An application would work with ELF data in its
.Dq native
representation, i.e., using the native byteorder and alignment mandated
by the processor the application is running on.
The
.Dq file
representation of the same data could use a different byte ordering
and follow different constraints on object alignment than these native
constraints.
.Pp
Accordingly, the
.Xr ELF 3
library offers translation facilities
.Xr ( elf32_xlatetof 3 ,
.Xr elf32_xlatetom 3 ,
.Xr elf64_xlatetof 3
and
.Xr elf64_xlatetom 3 )
to and from these representations.
It also provides higher-level APIs
.Xr ( gelf_xlatetof 3 ,
.Xr gelf_xlatetom 3 )
that retrieve and store data from the ELF object in a class-agnostic
manner.
.Ss Library Working Version
Conceptually, there are three version numbers associated with an
application using the ELF library to manipulate ELF objects:
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
The ELF version that the application was compiled against.
This version determines the ABI expected by the application.
.It
The ELF version of the ELF object being manipulated by the
application through the ELF library.
.It
The ELF version (or set of versions) supported by the ELF library itself.
.El
.Pp
In order to facilitate working with ELF objects of differing versions,
the ELF library requires the application to call the
.Fn elf_version
function before invoking many of its operations, in order to inform
the library of the application's desired working version.
.Pp
In the current implementation, all three versions have to be
.Dv EV_CURRENT .
.Ss Namespace use
The ELF library uses the following prefixes:
.Bl -tag -width "ELF_F_*"
.It Dv elf_
Used for class-independent functions.
.It Dv elf32_
Used for functions working with 32 bit ELF objects.
.It Dv elf64_
Used for functions working with 64 bit ELF objects.
.It Dv Elf_
Used for class-independent data types.
.It Dv ELF_C_
Used for command values used in a few functions.
These symbols are defined as members of the
.Vt Elf_Cmd
enumeration.
.It Dv ELF_E_
Used for error numbers.
.It Dv ELF_F_
Used for flags.
.It Dv ELF_K_
These constants define the kind of file associated with an ELF
descriptor.
See
.Xr elf_kind 3 .
The symbols are defined by the
.Vt Elf_Kind
enumeration.
.It Dv ELF_T_
These values are defined by the
.Vt Elf_Type
enumeration, and denote the types of ELF data structures
that can be present in an ELF object.
.El
.Pp
In addition, the library uses symbols with prefixes
.Dv _ELF
and
.Dv _libelf
for its internal use.
.Ss Descriptors
Applications communicate with the library using descriptors.
These are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Vt Elf_Data"
.It Vt Elf
An
.Vt Elf
descriptor represents an ELF object or an
.Xr ar 1
archive.
It is allocated using one of the
.Fn elf_begin
or
.Fn elf_memory
functions.
An
.Vt Elf
descriptor can be used to read and write data to an ELF file.
An
.Vt Elf
descriptor can be associated with zero or more
.Vt Elf_Scn
section descriptors.
.Pp
Given an ELF descriptor, the application may retrieve the ELF
object's class-dependent
.Dq "Executable Header"
structures using the
.Fn elf32_getehdr
or
.Fn elf64_getehdr
functions.
A new Ehdr structure may be allocated using the
.Fn elf64_newehdr
or
.Fn elf64_newehdr
functions.
.Pp
The
.Dq "Program Header Table"
associated with an ELF descriptor may be allocated using the
.Fn elf32_getphdr
or
.Fn elf64_getphdr
functions.
A new program header table may be allocated or an existing table
resized using the
.Fn elf32_newphdr
or
.Fn elf64_newphdr
functions.
.Pp
The
.Vt Elf
structure is opaque and has no members visible to the
application.
.It Vt Elf_Data
An
.Vt Elf_Data
data structure describes an individual chunk of a ELF file as
represented in memory.
It has the following application-visible members:
.Bl -tag -width ".Vt unsigned int d_version" -compact
.It Vt "uint64_t d_align"
The in-file alignment of the data buffer within its containing ELF section.
This value must be non-zero and a power of two.
.It Vt "void *d_buf"
A pointer to data in memory.
.It Vt "uint64_t d_off"
The offset within the containing section where this descriptor's data
would be placed.
This field will be computed by the library unless the application
requests full control of the ELF object's layout.
.It Vt "uint64_t d_size"
The number of bytes of data in this descriptor.
.It Vt "Elf_Type d_type"
The ELF type (see below) of the data in this descriptor.
.It Vt "unsigned int d_version"
The operating version for the data in this buffer.
.El
.Pp
.Vt Elf_Data
descriptors are usually associated with
.Vt Elf_Scn
descriptors.
Existing data descriptors associated with an ELF section may be
structures are retrieved using the
.Fn elf_getdata
and
.Fn elf_rawdata
functions.
The
.Fn elf_newdata
function may be used to attach new data descriptors to an ELF section.
.It Vt Elf_Scn
.Vt Elf_Scn
descriptors represent a section in an ELF object.
.Pp
They are retrieved using the
.Fn elf_getscn
function.
An application may iterate through the existing sections of an ELF
object using the
.Fn elf_nextscn
function.
New sections may be allocated using the
.Fn elf_newscn
function.
.Pp
The
.Vt Elf_Scn
descriptor is opaque and contains no application modifiable fields.
.El
.Ss Supported Elf Types

.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv ELF_T_SYMINFO" -compact

.Ss Controlling ELF Object Layout
In the usual mode of operation, library will compute section
offsets and alignments based on the contents of an ELF descriptor's
sections without need for further intervention by the
application.
.Pp
However, if the application wishes to take complete charge of the
layout of the ELF file, it may set the
.Dv ELF_F_LAYOUT
flag on an ELF descriptor using
.Xr elf_flagelf 3 ,
following which the library will use the data offsets and alignments
specified by the application when laying out the file.
Application control of file layout is described further in the
.Xr elf_update 3
manual page.
.Pp
Gaps in between sections will be filled with the fill character
set by function
.Fn elf_fill .
.Ss Error Handling
In case an error is encountered, these library functions set an
internal error number and signal the presence of the error by
returning an special return value.
The application can check the
current error number by calling
.Xr elf_errno 3 .
A human readable description of the recorded error is available by
calling
.Xr elf_errmsg 3 .
.Ss Memory Management Rules
The library keeps track of all
.Vt Elf_Scn
and
.Vt Elf_Data
descriptors associated with an ELF descriptor and recovers them
when the descriptor is closed using
.Xr elf_end 3 .
Thus the application must not call
.Xr free 3
on data structures allocated by the ELF library.
.Pp
Conversely the library will not
free data that it has not allocated.
As an example, an application may call
.Xr elf_newdata 3
to allocate a new
.Vt Elf_Data
descriptor and can set the
.Va d_off
member of the descriptor to point to a region of memory allocated
using
.Xr malloc 3 .
It is the applications responsibility to free this arena, though the
library will reclaim the space used by the
.Vt Elf_Data
descriptor itself.
