.Sh NAME
.Nm elf32_newphdr ,
.Nm elf64_newphdr ,
.Nm gelf_newphdr
.Nd allocate an ELF program header table
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libelf
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libelf.h
.Ft "Elf32_Phdr *"
.Fn elf32_newphdr "Elf *elf" "size_t count"
.Ft "Elf64_Phdr *"
.Fn elf64_newphdr "Elf *elf" "size_t count"
.In gelf.h
.Ft "void *"
.Fn gelf_newphdr "Elf *elf" "size_t count"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions allocate an ELF Program Header table
for an ELF descriptor.
.Vt Elf32_Phdr
and
.Vt Elf64_Phdr
descriptors are described further in
.Xr elf 5 .
.Pp
Functions
.Fn elf32_newphdr
and
.Fn elf64_newphdr
allocate a table of
.Ar count
.Vt Elf32_Phdr
and
.Vt Elf64_Phdr
descriptors respectively,
discarding any existing program header table
already present in the ELF descriptor
.Ar elf .
A value of zero for argument
.Ar count
may be used to delete an existing program header table
from an ELF descriptor.
.Pp
Function
.Fn gelf_newphdr
will return a table of
.Vt Elf32_Phdr
or
.Vt Elf64_Phdr
with
.Ar count
elements depending on the ELF class of ELF descriptor
.Ar elf .
.Pp
The functions set the
.Dv ELF_F_DIRTY
flag on the program header table.
All members of the returned array of Phdr structures
will be initialized to zero.
.Pp
After a successful call to these functions, the pointer returned
by a prior call to
.Fn elf32_getphdr
or
.Fn elf64_getphdr
on the same descriptor
.Ar elf
will no longer be valid.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The functions a valid pointer if successful, or NULL in case an error
was encountered.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Fn gelf_newphdr
function uses a type of
.Ft "void *"
for its returned value.
This differs from some other implementations of the ELF(3) API, which use an
.Ft "unsigned long"
return type.
.Sh ERRORS
These functions may fail with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width "[ELF_E_RESOURCE]"
.It Bq Er ELF_E_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Ar elf
was NULL.
.It Bq Er ELF_E_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Ar elf
was not a descriptor for an ELF object.
.It Bq Er ELF_E_CLASS
ELF descriptor
.Ar elf
was of an unrecognized class.
.It Bq Er ELF_E_RESOURCE
An out of memory condition was detected.
.It Bq Er ELF_E_SEQUENCE
An executable header was not allocated for ELF descriptor
.Ar elf
before using these APIs.
