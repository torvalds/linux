.Sh NAME
.Nm elf_hash
.Nd compute a hash value for a string
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libelf
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libelf.h
.Ft "unsigned long"
.Fn elf_hash "const char *name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn elf_hash
computes a portable hash value for the null terminated string
pointed to by argument
.Ar name .
.Pp
The hash value returned is will be identical across
machines of different architectures.
This allows hash tables to be built on one machine and
correctly used on another of a different architecture.
The hash value returned is also guaranteed
.Em not
to be the bit pattern of all ones (~0UL).
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The library internally uses unsigned 32 bit arithmetic to compute
the hash value.
