.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm GElf
.Nd class-independent API for ELF manipulation
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libelf
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In gelf.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes a class independent API for manipulating
ELF objects.
This API allows an application to operate on ELF descriptors without
needing to the know the ELF class of the descriptor.
.Pp
The GElf API may be used alongside the ELF API without restriction.
.Ss GElf Data Structures
The GElf API defines the following class-independent data structures:
.Bl -tag -width GElf_Sxword
.It Vt GElf_Addr
A representation of ELF addresses.
.It Vt GElf_Dyn
A class-independent representation of ELF
.Sy .dynamic
section entries.
.It Vt GElf_Ehdr
A class-independent representation of an ELF Executable Header.
.It Vt GElf_Half
An unsigned 16 bit quantity.
.It Vt GElf_Off
A class-independent representation of a ELF offset.
.It Vt GElf_Phdr
A class-independent representation of an ELF Program Header Table
entry.
.It Vt GElf_Rel
A class-independent representation of an ELF relocation entry.
.It Vt GElf_Rela
A class-independent representation of an ELF relocation entry with
addend.
.It Vt GElf_Shdr
A class-independent representation of an ELF Section Header Table
entry.
.It Vt GElf_Sword
A signed 32 bit quantity.
.It Vt GElf_Sxword
A signed 64 bit quantity.
.It Vt GElf_Sym
A class-independent representation of an ELF symbol table entry.
.It Vt GElf_Word
An unsigned 32 bit quantity.
.It Vt GElf_Xword
An unsigned 64 bit quantity.
.El
.Pp
These data structures are sized to be compatible with the
corresponding 64 bit ELF structures, and have the same internal
structure as their 64 bit class-dependent counterparts.
Class-dependent ELF structures are described in
.Xr elf 5 .
.Ss GElf Programming Model
GElf functions always return a
.Em copy
of the underlying (class-dependent) ELF data structure.
The programming model with GElf is as follows:
.Bl -enum
.It
An application will retrieve data from an ELF descriptor using a
.Fn gelf_get_*
function.
This will copy out data into a private
.Vt GElf_*
data structure.
.It
The application will work with its private copy of the GElf
structure.
.It
Once done, the application copies the new values back to the
underlying ELF data structure using the
.Fn gelf_update_*
functions.
.It
The application will then use the
.Fn elf_flag*
APIs to indicate to the ELF library that an ELF data structure is dirty.
.El
.Pp
When updating an underlying 32 bit ELF data structure, the GElf
routines will signal an error if a GElf value is out of range
for the underlying ELF data type.
.Ss Namespace use
The GElf interface uses the following symbols:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It GElf_*
Class-independent data types.
.It gelf_*
For functions defined in the API set.
.El
