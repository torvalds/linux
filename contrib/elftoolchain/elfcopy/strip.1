.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to discard information from ELF objects.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d | Fl g | Fl S | Fl -strip-debug
Remove debugging symbols only.
.It Fl h | Fl -help
Print a help message and exit.
.It Fl -only-keep-debug
Remove all content except that which would be used for debugging.
.It Fl o Ar outputfile | Fl -output-file= Ns Ar outputfile
Write the stripped object to file
.Ar outputfile .
The default behaviour is to modify objects in place.
.It Fl p | Fl -preserve-dates
Preserve the object's access and modification times.
.It Fl s | Fl -strip-all
Remove all symbols.
.It Fl -strip-unneeded
Remove all symbols not needed for further relocation processing.
.It Fl w | Fl -wildcard
Use shell-style patterns to name symbols.
The following meta-characters are recognized in patterns:
.Bl -tag -width "...." -compact
.It Li !
If this is the first character of the pattern, invert the sense of the
pattern match.
.It Li *
Matches any string of characters in a symbol name.
.It Li ?
Matches zero or one character in a symbol name.
.It Li [
Mark the start of a character class.
.It Li \e
Remove the special meaning of the next character in the pattern.
.It Li ]
Mark the end of a character class.
.El
.It Fl x | Fl -discard-all
Discard all non-global symbols.
.It Fl I Ar format | Fl -input-target= Ns Ar format
These options are accepted, but are ignored.
.It Fl K Ar symbol | Fl -keep-symbol= Ns Ar symbol
Keep the symbol
.Ar symbol
even if it would otherwise be stripped.
This option may be specified multiple times.
.It Fl N Ar symbol | Fl -strip-symbol= Ns Ar symbol
Remove the symbol
.Ar symbol
even if it would otherwise have been kept.
This option may be specified multiple times.
.It Fl O Ar format | Fl -output-target= Ns Ar format
Set the output file format to
.Ar format .
For the full list of supported formats, please see the documentation
for function
.Xr elftc_bfd_find_target 3 .
.It Fl R Ar sectionname | Fl -remove-section= Ns Ar sectionname
Remove the section named by the argument
.Ar sectionname .
This option may be specified multiple times.
.It Fl V | Fl -version
Print a version identifier and exit.
.It Fl X | Fl -discard-locals
Remove compiler-generated local symbols.
