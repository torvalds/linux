| BUILDING SENDMAIL |
+-------------------+

By far, the easiest way to compile sendmail is to use the "Build"
script:

	sh ./Build

This uses the "uname" command to figure out what architecture you are
on and creates a proper Makefile accordingly.  It also creates a
subdirectory per object format, so that multiarchitecture support is
easy.  In general this should be all you need.  IRIX 6.x users should
read the note below in the OPERATING SYSTEM AND COMPILE QUIRKS section.

If you need to look at other include or library directories, use the
-I or -L flags on the command line, e.g.,

	sh ./Build -I/usr/sww/include -L/usr/sww/lib

It's also possible to create local site configuration in the file
site.config.m4 (or another file settable with the -f flag).  This
file contains M4 definitions for various compilation values; the
most useful are:

confMAPDEF	-D flags to specify database types to be included
		(see below)
confENVDEF	-D flags to specify other environment information
confINCDIRS	-I flags for finding include files during compilation
confLIBDIRS	-L flags for finding libraries during linking
confLIBS	-l flags for selecting libraries during linking
confLDOPTS	other ld(1) linker options

Others can be found by examining Makefile.m4.  Please read
../devtools/README for more information about the site.config.m4
file.

You can recompile from scratch using the -c flag with the Build
command.  This removes the existing compilation directory for the
current platform and builds a new one.  The -c flag must also
be used if any site.*.m4 file in devtools/Site/ is changed.

Porting to a new Unix-based system should be a matter of creating
an appropriate configuration file in the devtools/OS/ directory.


+----------------------+
| DATABASE DEFINITIONS |
+----------------------+

There are several database formats that can be used for the alias files
and for general maps.  When used for alias files they interact in an
attempt to be backward compatible.

The options are:

NEWDB		The new Berkeley DB package.  Some systems (e.g., BSD/OS and
		Digital UNIX 4.0) have some version of this package
		pre-installed.  If your system does not have Berkeley DB
		pre-installed, or the version installed is not version 2.0
		or greater (e.g., is Berkeley DB 1.85 or 1.86), get the
		current version from http://www.sleepycat.com/.  DO NOT
		use a version from any of the University of California,
		Berkeley "Net" or other distributions.  If you are still
		running BSD/386 1.x, you will need to upgrade the included
		Berkeley DB library to a current version.  NEWDB is included
		automatically if the Build script can find a library named
		libdb.a or libdb.so.
		See also OPERATING SYSTEM AND COMPILE QUIRKS about Berkeley
		DB versions, e.g., DB 4.1.x.
NDBM		The older NDBM implementation -- the very old V7 DBM
		implementation is no longer supported.
NIS		Network Information Services.  To use this you must have
		NIS support on your system.
NISPLUS		NIS+ (the revised NIS released with Solaris 2).  You must
		have NIS+ support on your system to use this flag.
HESIOD		Support for Hesiod (from the DEC/Athena distribution).  You
		must already have Hesiod support on your system for this to
		work.  You may be able to get this to work with the MIT/Athena
		version of Hesiod, but that's likely to be a lot of work.
		BIND 8.X also includes Hesiod support.
LDAPMAP		Lightweight Directory Access Protocol support.  You will
		have to install the UMich or OpenLDAP
		(http://www.openldap.org/) ldap and lber libraries to use
		this flag.
MAP_REGEX	Regular Expression support.  You will need to use an
		operating system which comes with the POSIX regex()
		routines or install a regexp library such as libregex from
		the Free Software Foundation.
DNSMAP		DNS map support.  Requires NAMED_BIND.
PH_MAP		PH map support.  You will need the libphclient library from
		the nph package (http://www-dev.cites.uiuc.edu/ph/nph/).
MAP_NSD		nsd map support (IRIX 6.5 and later).
SOCKETMAP	Support for a trivial query protocol over UNIX domain or TCP
		sockets. 

>>>  NOTE WELL for NEWDB support: If you want to get ndbm support, for
>>>  Berkeley DB versions under 2.0, it is CRITICAL that you remove
>>>  ndbm.o from libdb.a before you install it and DO NOT install ndbm.h;
>>>  for Berkeley DB versions 2.0 through 2.3.14, remove dbm.o from libdb.a
>>>  before you install it.  If you don't delete these, there is absolutely
>>>  no point to including -DNDBM, since it will just get you another
>>>  (inferior) API to the same format database.  These files OVERRIDE
>>>  calls to ndbm routines -- in particular, if you leave ndbm.h in,
>>>  you can find yourself using the new db package even if you don't
>>>  define NEWDB.  Berkeley DB versions later than 2.3.14 do not need
>>>  to be modified.  Please also consult the README in the top level
>>>  directory of the sendmail distribution for other important information.
>>>
>>>  Further note: DO NOT remove your existing /usr/include/ndbm.h --
>>>  you need that one.  But do not install an updated ndbm.h in
>>>  /usr/include, /usr/local/include, or anywhere else.

If NEWDB and NDBM are defined (but not NIS), then sendmail will read
NDBM format alias files, but the next time a newaliases is run the
format will be converted to NEWDB; that format will be used forever
more.  This is intended as a transition feature.

If NEWDB, NDBM, and NIS are all defined and the name of the file includes
the string "/yp/", sendmail will rebuild BOTH the NEWDB and NDBM format
alias files.  However, it will only read the NEWDB file; the NDBM format
file is used only by the NIS subsystem.  This is needed because the NIS
maps on an NIS server are built directly from the NDBM files.

If NDBM and NIS are defined (regardless of the definition of NEWDB),
and the filename includes the string "/yp/", sendmail adds the special
tokens "YP_LAST_MODIFIED" and "YP_MASTER_NAME", both of which are
required if the NDBM file is to be used as an NIS map.

All of these flags are normally defined in a confMAPDEF setting in your
site.config.m4.

If you define NEWDB or HESIOD you get the User Database (USERDB)
automatically.  Generally you do want to have NEWDB for it to do
anything interesting.  See above for getting the Berkeley DB
package (i.e., NEWDB).  There is no separate "user database"
package -- don't bother searching for it on the net.

Hesiod and LDAP require libraries that may not be installed with your
system.  These are outside of my ability to provide support.  See the
"Quirks" section for more information.

The regex map can be used to see if an address matches a certain regular
expression.  For example, all-numerics local parts are common spam
addresses, so "^[0-9]+$" would match this.  By using such a map in a
check_* rule-set, you can block a certain range of addresses that would
otherwise be considered valid.

The socket map uses a simple request/reply protocol over TCP or
UNIX domain sockets to query an external server. Both requests and
replies are text based and encoded as netstrings.  The socket map
uses the same syntax as milters the specify the remote endpoint,
e.g.:

KmySocketMap socket inet:12345@127.0.0.1

See doc/op/op.me for details.

| COMPILE FLAGS |
+---------------+

Wherever possible, I try to make sendmail pull in the correct
compilation options needed to compile on various environments based on
automatically defined symbols.  Some machines don't seem to have useful
symbols available, requiring that a compilation flag be defined in
the Makefile; see the devtools/OS subdirectory for the supported
architectures.

If you are a system to which sendmail has already been ported you
should not have to touch the following symbols.  But if you are porting,
you may have to tweak the following compilation flags in conf.h in order
to get it to compile and link properly:

SYSTEM5		Adjust for System V (not necessarily Release 4).
SYS5SIGNALS	Use System V signal semantics -- the signal handler
		is automatically dropped when the signal is caught.
		If this is not set, use POSIX/BSD semantics, where the
		signal handler stays in force until an exec or an
		explicit delete.  Implied by SYSTEM5.
SYS5SETPGRP	Use System V setpgrp() semantics.  Implied by SYSTEM5.
HASNICE		Define this to zero if you lack the nice(2) system call.
HASRRESVPORT	Define this to zero if you lack the rresvport(3) system call.
HASFCHMOD	Define this to one if you have the fchmod(2) system call.
		This improves security.
HASFCHOWN	Define this to one if you have the fchown(2) system call.
		This is required for the TrustedUser option if sendmail
		must rebuild an (alias) map.
HASFLOCK	Set this if you prefer to use the flock(2) system call
		rather than using fcntl-based locking.  Fcntl locking
		has some semantic gotchas, but many vendor systems
		also interface it to lockd(8) to do NFS-style locking.
		Unfortunately, may vendors implementations of fcntl locking
		is just plain broken (e.g., locks are never released,
		causing your sendmail to deadlock; when the kernel runs
		out of locks your system crashes).  For this reason, I
		recommend always defining this unless you are absolutely
		certain that your fcntl locking implementation really works.
HASUNAME	Set if you have the "uname" system call.  Implied by
		SYSTEM5.
HASUNSETENV	Define this if your system library has the "unsetenv"
		subroutine.
HASSETSID	Define this if you have the setsid(2) system call.  This
		is implied if your system appears to be POSIX compliant.
HASINITGROUPS	Define this if you have the initgroups(3) routine.
HASSETVBUF	Define this if you have the setvbuf(3) library call.
		If you don't, setlinebuf will be used instead.  This
		defaults on if your compiler defines __STDC__.
HASSETREUID	Define this if you have setreuid(2) ***AND*** root can
		use setreuid to change to an arbitrary user.  This second
		condition is not satisfied on AIX 3.x.  You may find that
		your system has setresuid(2), (for example, on HP-UX) in
		which case you will also have to #define setreuid(r, e)
		to be the appropriate call.  Some systems (such as Solaris)
		have a compatibility routine that doesn't work properly,
		but may have "saved user ids" properly implemented so you
		can ``#define setreuid(r, e) seteuid(e)'' and have it work.
		The important thing is that you have a call that will set
		the effective uid independently of the real or saved uid
		and be able to set the effective uid back again when done.
		There's a test program in ../test/t_setreuid.c that will
		try things on your system.  Setting this improves the
		security, since sendmail doesn't have to read .forward
		and :include: files as root.  There are certain attacks
		that may be unpreventable without this call.
USESETEUID	Define this to 1 if you have a seteuid(2) system call that
		will allow root to set only the effective user id to an
		arbitrary value ***AND*** you have saved user ids.  This is
		preferable to HASSETREUID if these conditions are fulfilled.
		These are the semantics of the to-be-released revision of
		Posix.1.  The test program ../test/t_seteuid.c will try
		this out on your system.  If you define both HASSETREUID
		and USESETEUID, the former is ignored.
HASSETEGID	Define this if you have setegid(2) and it can be
		used to set the saved gid.  Please run t_dropgid in
		test/ if you are not sure whether the call works.
HASSETREGID	Define this if you have setregid(2) and it can be
		used to set the saved gid.  Please run t_dropgid in
		test/ if you are not sure whether the call works.
HASSETRESGID	Define this if you have setresgid(2) and it can be
		used to set the saved gid.  Please run t_dropgid in
		test/ if you are not sure whether the call works.
HASLSTAT	Define this if you have symbolic links (and thus the
		lstat(2) system call).  This improves security.  Unlike
		most other options, this one is on by default, so you
		need to #undef it in conf.h if you don't have symbolic
		links (these days everyone does).
HASSETRLIMIT	Define this to 1 if you have the setrlimit(2) syscall.
		You can define it to 0 to force it off.  It is assumed
		if you are running a BSD-like system.
HASULIMIT	Define this if you have the ulimit(2) syscall (System V
		style systems).  HASSETRLIMIT overrides, as it is more
		general.
HASWAITPID	Define this if you have the waitpid(2) syscall.
HASGETDTABLESIZE
		Define this if you have the getdtablesize(2) syscall.
HAS_ST_GEN	Define this to 1 if your system has the st_gen field in
		the stat structure (see stat(2)).
HASSRANDOMDEV	Define this if your system has the srandomdev(3) function
		call.
HASURANDOMDEV	Define this if your system has /dev/urandom(4).
HASSTRERROR	Define this if you have the libc strerror(3) function (which
		should be declared in <errno.h>), and it should be used
		instead of sys_errlist.
HASCLOSEFROM	Define this if your system has closefrom(3).
HASFDWALK	Define this if your system has fdwalk(3).
SM_CONF_GETOPT	Define this as 0 if you need a reimplementation of getopt(3).
		On some systems, getopt does very odd things if called
		to scan the arguments twice.  This flag will ask sendmail
		to compile in a local version of getopt that works
		properly.  You may also need this if you build with
		another library that introduces a non-standard getopt(3).
NEEDSTRTOL	Define this if your standard C library does not define
		strtol(3).  This will compile in a local version.
NEEDFSYNC	Define this if your standard C library does not define
		fsync(2).  This will try to simulate the operation using
		fcntl(2); if that is not available it does nothing, which
		isn't great, but at least it compiles and runs.
HASGETUSERSHELL	Define this to 1 if you have getusershell(3) in your
		standard C library.  If this is not defined, or is defined
		to be 0, sendmail will scan the /etc/shells file (no
		NIS-style support, defaults to /bin/sh and /bin/csh if
		that file does not exist) to get a list of unrestricted
		user shells.  This is used to determine whether users
		are allowed to forward their mail to a program or a file.
NEEDPUTENV	Define this if your system needs am emulation of the
		putenv(3) call.  Define to 1 to implement it in terms
		of setenv(3) or to 2 to do it in terms of primitives.
NOFTRUNCATE	Define this if you don't have the ftruncate(2) syscall.
		If you don't have this system call, there is an unavoidable
		race condition that occurs when creating alias databases.
GIDSET_T	The type of entries in a gidset passed as the second
		argument to getgroups(2).  Historically this has been an
		int, so this is the default, but some systems (such as
		IRIX) pass it as a gid_t, which is an unsigned short.
		This will make a difference, so it is important to get
		this right!  However, it is only an issue if you have
		group sets.
SLEEP_T		The type returned by the system sleep() function.
		Defaults to "unsigned int".  Don't worry about this
		if you don't have compilation problems.
ARBPTR_T	The type of an arbitrary pointer -- defaults to "void *".
		If you are an very old compiler you may need to define
		this to be "char *".
SOCKADDR_LEN_T	The type used for the third parameter to accept(2),
		getsockname(2), and getpeername(2), representing the
		length of a struct sockaddr.  Defaults to int.
SOCKOPT_LEN_T	The type used for the fifth parameter to getsockopt(2)
		and setsockopt(2), representing the length of the option
		buffer.  Defaults to int.
LA_TYPE		The type of load average your kernel supports.  These
		can be one of:
		 LA_ZERO (1) -- it always returns the load average as
			"zero" (and does so on all architectures).
		 LA_INT (2) to read /dev/kmem for the symbol avenrun and
			interpret as a long integer.
		 LA_FLOAT (3) same, but interpret the result as a floating
			point number.
		 LA_SHORT (6) to interpret as a short integer.
		 LA_SUBR (4) if you have the getloadavg(3) routine in your
			system library.
		 LA_MACH (5) to use MACH-style load averages (calls
			processor_set_info()),
		 LA_PROCSTR (7) to read /proc/loadavg and interpret it
			as a string representing a floating-point
			number (Linux-style).
		 LA_READKSYM (8) is an implementation suitable for some
			versions of SVr4 that uses the MIOC_READKSYM ioctl
			call to read /dev/kmem.
		 LA_DGUX (9) is a special implementation for DG/UX that uses
			the dg_sys_info system call.
		 LA_HPUX (10) is an HP-UX specific version that uses the
			pstat_getdynamic system call.
		 LA_IRIX6 (11) is an IRIX 6.x specific version that adapts
			to 32 or 64 bit kernels; it is otherwise very similar
			to LA_INT.
		 LA_KSTAT (12) uses the (Solaris-specific) kstat(3k)
			implementation.
		 LA_DEVSHORT (13) reads a short from a system file (default:
			/dev/table/avenrun) and scales it in the same manner
			as LA_SHORT.
		 LA_LONGLONG (17) to read /dev/kmem for the symbol avenrun and
			interpret as a long long integer (e.g., for 64 bit
			systems).
		LA_INT, LA_SHORT, LA_FLOAT, and LA_READKSYM have several
		other parameters that they try to divine: the name of your
		kernel, the name of the variable in the kernel to examine,
		the number of bits of precision in a fixed point load average,
		and so forth.  LA_DEVSHORT uses _PATH_AVENRUN to find the
		device to be read to find the load average.
		In desperation, use LA_ZERO.  The actual code is in
		conf.c -- it can be tweaked if you are brave.
FSHIFT		For LA_INT, LA_SHORT, and LA_READKSYM, this is the number
		of bits of load average after the binary point -- i.e.,
		the number of bits to shift right in order to scale the
		integer to get the true integer load average.  Defaults to 8.
_PATH_UNIX	The path to your kernel.  Needed only for LA_INT, LA_SHORT,
		and LA_FLOAT.  Defaults to "/unix" on System V, "/vmunix"
		everywhere else.
LA_AVENRUN	For LA_INT, LA_SHORT, and LA_FLOAT, the name of the kernel
		variable that holds the load average.  Defaults to "avenrun"
		on System V, "_avenrun" everywhere else.
SFS_TYPE	Encodes how your kernel can locate the amount of free
		space on a disk partition.  This can be set to SFS_NONE
		(0) if you have no way of getting this information,
		SFS_USTAT (1) if you have the ustat(2) system call,
		SFS_4ARGS (2) if you have a four-argument statfs(2)
		system call (and the include file is <sys/statfs.h>),
		SFS_VFS (3), SFS_MOUNT (4), SFS_STATFS (5) if you have
		the two-argument statfs(2) system call with includes in
		<sys/vfs.h>, <sys/mount.h>, or <sys/statfs.h> respectively,
		or SFS_STATVFS (6) if you have the two-argument statvfs(2)
		call.  The default if nothing is defined is SFS_NONE.
SFS_BAVAIL	with SFS_4ARGS you can also set SFS_BAVAIL to the field name
		in the statfs structure that holds the useful information;
		this defaults to f_bavail.
SPT_TYPE	Encodes how your system can display what a process is doing
		on a ps(1) command (SPT stands for Set Process Title).  Can
		be set to:
		SPT_NONE (0) -- Don't try to set the process title at all.
		SPT_REUSEARGV (1) -- Pad out your argv with the information;
			this is the default if none specified.
		SPT_BUILTIN (2) -- The system library has setproctitle.
		SPT_PSTAT (3) -- Use the PSTAT_SETCMD option to pstat(2)
			to set the process title; this is used by HP-UX.
		SPT_PSSTRINGS (4) -- Use the magic PS_STRINGS pointer (4.4BSD).
		SPT_SYSMIPS (5) -- Use sysmips() supported by NEWS-OS 6.
		SPT_SCO (6) -- Write kernel u. area.
		SPT_CHANGEARGV (7) -- Write pointers to our own strings into
			the existing argv vector.
SPT_PADCHAR	Character used to pad the process title; if undefined,
		the space character (0x20) is used.  This is ignored if
		SPT_TYPE != SPT_REUSEARGV
ERRLIST_PREDEFINED
		If set, assumes that some header file defines sys_errlist.
		This may be needed if you get type conflicts on this
		variable -- otherwise don't worry about it.
WAITUNION	The wait(2) routine takes a "union wait" argument instead
		of an integer argument.  This is for compatibility with
		old versions of BSD.
SCANF		You can set this to extend the F command to accept a
		scanf string -- this gives you a primitive parser for
		class definitions -- BUT it can make you vulnerable to
		core dumps if the target file is poorly formed.
SYSLOG_BUFSIZE	You can define this to be the size of the buffer that
		syslog accepts.  If it is not defined, it assumes a
		1024-byte buffer.  If the buffer is very small (under
		256 bytes) the log message format changes -- each
		e-mail message will log many more messages, since it
		will log each piece of information as a separate line
		in syslog.
BROKEN_RES_SEARCH
		On Ultrix (and maybe other systems?) if you use the
		res_search routine with an unknown host name, it returns
		-1 but sets h_errno to 0 instead of HOST_NOT_FOUND.  If
		you set this, sendmail considers 0 to be the same as
		HOST_NOT_FOUND.
NAMELISTMASK	If defined, values returned by nlist(3) are masked
		against this value before use -- a common value is
		0x7fffffff to strip off the top bit.
BSD4_4_SOCKADDR	If defined, socket addresses have an sa_len field that
		defines the length of this address.
SAFENFSPATHCONF	Set this to 1 if and only if you have verified that a
		pathconf(2) call with _PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED argument on an
		NFS filesystem where the underlying system allows users to
		give away files to other users returns <= 0.  Be sure you
		try both on NFS V2 and V3.  Some systems assume that their
		local policy apply to NFS servers -- this is a bad
		assumption!  The test/t_pathconf.c program will try this
		for you -- you have to run it in a directory that is
		mounted from a server that allows file giveaway.
SIOCGIFCONF_IS_BROKEN
		Set this if your system has an SIOCGIFCONF ioctl defined,
		but it doesn't behave the same way as "most" systems (BSD,
		Solaris, SunOS, HP-UX, etc.)
SIOCGIFNUM_IS_BROKEN
		Set this if your system has an SIOCGIFNUM ioctl defined,
		but it doesn't behave the same way as "most" systems
		(Solaris, HP-UX).
FAST_PID_RECYCLE
		Set this if your system can reuse the same PID in the same
		second.
SO_REUSEADDR_IS_BROKEN
		Set this if your system has a setsockopt() SO_REUSEADDR
		flag but doesn't pay attention to it when trying to bind a
		socket to a recently closed port.
NEEDSGETIPNODE	Set this if your system supports IPv6 but doesn't include
		the getipnodeby{name,addr}() functions.  Set automatically
		for Linux's glibc.
PIPELINING	Support SMTP PIPELINING	(set by default).
USING_NETSCAPE_LDAP
		Deprecated in favor of SM_CONF_LDAP_MEMFREE.  See
		libsm/README.
NEEDLINK	Set this if your system doesn't have a link() call.  It
		will create a copy of the file instead of a hardlink.
USE_ENVIRON	Set this to 1 to access process environment variables from
		the external variable environ instead of the third
		parameter of main().
USE_DOUBLE_FORK By default this is on (1).  Set it to 0 to suppress the
		extra fork() used to avoid intermediate zombies.
ALLOW_255	Do not convert (char)0xff to (char)0x7f in headers etc.
		This can also be done at runtime with the command line
		option -d82.101.
NEEDINTERRNO	Set this if <errno.h> does not declare errno, i.e., if an
		application needs to use
		extern int errno;
USE_TTYPATH	Set this to 1 to enable ErrorMode=write.
USESYSCTL	Use sysctl(3) to determine the number of CPUs in a system.
HASSNPRINTF	Set this to 1 if your OS has a working snprintf(3), i.e.,
		it properly obeys the size of the buffer and returns the
		number of characters that would have been printed if the
		size were unlimited.
LDAP_REFERRALS	Set this if you want to use the -R flag (do not auto chase
		referrals) for LDAP maps (requires -DLDAPMAP).
MILTER_NO_NAGLE	Turn off Nagle algorithm for communication with libmilter
		("cork" on Linux).  On some operating systems this may
		improve the interprocess communication performance.


+-----------------------+
| COMPILE-TIME FEATURES |
+-----------------------+

There are a bunch of features that you can decide to compile in, such
as selecting various database packages and special protocol support.
Several are assumed based on other compilation flags -- if you want to
"un-assume" something, you probably need to edit conf.h.  Compilation
flags that add support for special features include:

NDBM		Include support for "new" DBM library for aliases and maps.
		Normally defined in the Makefile.
NEWDB		Include support for Berkeley DB package (hash & btree)
		for aliases and maps.  Normally defined in the Makefile.
		If the version of NEWDB you have is the old one that does
		not include the "fd" call (this call was added in version
		1.5 of the Berkeley DB code), you must upgrade to the
		current version of Berkeley DB.
NIS		Define this to get NIS (YP) support for aliases and maps.
		Normally defined in the Makefile.
NISPLUS		Define this to get NIS+ support for aliases and maps.
		Normally defined in the Makefile.
HESIOD		Define this to get Hesiod support for aliases and maps.
		Normally defined in the Makefile.
NETINFO		Define this to get NeXT NetInfo support for aliases and maps.
		Normally defined in the Makefile.
LDAPMAP		Define this to get LDAP support for maps.
PH_MAP		Define this to get PH support for maps.
MAP_NSD		Define this to get nsd support for maps.
USERDB		Define this to 1 to include support for the User Information
		Database.  Implied by NEWDB or HESIOD.  You can use
		-DUSERDB=0 to explicitly turn it off.
IDENTPROTO	Define this as 1 to get IDENT (RFC 1413) protocol support.
		This is assumed unless you are running on Ultrix or
		HP-UX, both of which have a problem in the UDP
		implementation.  You can define it to be 0 to explicitly
		turn off IDENT protocol support.  If defined off, the code
		is actually still compiled in, but it defaults off; you
		can turn it on by setting the IDENT timeout in the
		configuration file.
IP_SRCROUTE	Define this to 1 to get IP source routing information
		displayed in the Received: header.  This is assumed on
		most systems, but some (e.g., Ultrix) apparently have a
		broken version of getsockopt that doesn't properly
		support the IP_OPTIONS call.  You probably want this if
		your OS can cope with it.  Symptoms of failure will be that
		it won't compile properly (that is, no support for fetching
		IP_OPTIONs), or it compiles but source-routed TCP connections
		either refuse to open or open and hang for no apparent reason.
		Ultrix and AIX3 are known to fail this way.
LOG		Set this to get syslog(3) support.  Defined by default
		in conf.h.  You want this if at all possible.
NETINET		Set this to get TCP/IP support.  Defined by default
		in conf.h.  You probably want this.
NETINET6	Set this to get IPv6 support.  Other configuration may
		be needed in conf.h for your particular operating system.
		Also, DaemonPortOptions must be set appropriately for
		sendmail to accept IPv6 connections.
NETISO		Define this to get ISO networking support.
NETUNIX		Define this to get Unix domain networking support.  Defined
		by default.  A few bizarre systems (SCO, ISC, Altos) don't
		support this networking domain.
NETNS		Define this to get NS networking support.
NETX25		Define this to get X.25 networking support.
NAMED_BIND	If non-zero, include DNS (name daemon) support, including
		MX support.  The specs say you must use this if you run
		SMTP.  You don't have to be running a name server daemon
		on your machine to need this -- any use of the DNS resolver,
		including remote access to another machine, requires this
		option.  Defined by default in conf.h.  Define it to zero
		ONLY on machines that do not use DNS in any way.
MATCHGECOS	Permit fuzzy matching of user names against the full
		name (GECOS) field in the /etc/passwd file.  This should
		probably be on, since you can disable it from the config
		file if you want to.  Defined by default in conf.h.
MIME8TO7	If non-zero, include 8 to 7 bit MIME conversions.  This
		also controls advertisement of 8BITMIME in the ESMTP
		startup dialogue.
MIME7TO8_OLD	If 0 then use an algorithm for MIME 7-bit quoted-printable
		or base64 encoding to 8-bit text that has been introduced
		in 8.12.3.  There are some examples where that code fails,
		but the old code works.  If you have an example of improper
		7 to 8 bit conversion please send it to sendmail-bugs.
MIME7TO8	If non-zero, include 7 to 8 bit MIME conversions.
HES_GETMAILHOST	Define this to 1 if you are using Hesiod with the
		hes_getmailhost() routine.  This is included with the MIT
		Hesiod distribution, but not with the DEC Hesiod distribution.
XDEBUG		Do additional internal checking.  These don't cost too
		much; you might as well leave this on.
TCPWRAPPERS	Turns on support for the TCP wrappers library (-lwrap).
		See below for further information.
SECUREWARE	Enable calls to the SecureWare luid enabling/changing routines.
		SecureWare is a C2 security package added to several UNIX's
		(notably ConvexOS) to get a C2 Secure system.  This
		option causes mail delivery to be done with the luid of the
		recipient.
SHARE_V1	Support for the fair share scheduler, version 1.  Setting to
		1 causes final delivery to be done using the recipients
		resource limitations.  So far as I know, this is only
		supported on ConvexOS.
SASL		Enables SMTP AUTH (RFC 2554).  This requires the Cyrus SASL
		library (ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/).  Please
		install at least version 1.5.13.  See below for further
		information: SASL COMPILATION AND CONFIGURATION.  If your
		SASL library is older than 1.5.10, you have to set this
		to its version number using a simple conversion:  a.b.c
		-> c + b*100 + a*10000, e.g. for 1.5.9 define SASL=10509.
		Note: Using an older version than 1.5.5 of Cyrus SASL is
		not supported.  Starting with version 1.5.10, setting SASL=1
		is sufficient.  Any value other than 1 (or 0) will be
		compared with the actual version found and if there is a
		mismatch, compilation will fail.
EGD		Define this if your system has EGD installed, see
		http://egd.sourceforge.net/ .  It should be used to
		seed the PRNG for STARTTLS if HASURANDOMDEV is not defined.
STARTTLS	Enables SMTP STARTTLS (RFC 2487).  This requires OpenSSL
		(http://www.OpenSSL.org/); use OpenSSL 0.9.8zc or later.
		See STARTTLS COMPILATION AND CONFIGURATION for further
		information.
TLS_NO_RSA	Turn off support for RSA algorithms in STARTTLS.
MILTER		Turn on support for external filters using the Milter API;
		this option is set by default, to turn it off use
			APPENDDEF(`conf_sendmail_ENVDEF', `-DMILTER=0')
		in devtools/Site/site.config.m4 (see devtools/README).
		See libmilter/README for more information about milter.
REQUIRES_DIR_FSYNC	Turn on support for file systems that require to
		call fsync() for a directory if the meta-data in it has
		been changed.  This should be turned on at least for older
		versions of ReiserFS; it is enabled by default for Linux.
		According to some information this flag is not needed
		anymore for kernel 2.4.16 and newer.  We would appreciate
		feedback about the semantics of the various file systems
		available for Linux.
		An alternative to this compile time flag is to mount the
		queue directory without the -async option, or using
		chattr +S on Linux.
DBMMODE		The default file permissions to use when creating new
		database files for maps and aliases.  Defaults to 0640.
IPV6_FULL	Use uncompressed IPv6 addresses (set by default).  This
		permits a zero subnet to have a more specific match,
		such as different map entries for IPv6:0:0 vs IPv6:0.

Generic notice: If you enable a compile time option that needs
libraries or include files that don't come with sendmail or are
installed in a location that your C compiler doesn't use by default
you should set confINCDIRS and confLIBDIRS as explained in the
first section:  BUILDING SENDMAIL.


+---------------------+
| DNS/RESOLVER ISSUES |
+---------------------+

Many systems have old versions of the resolver library.  At a minimum,
you should be running BIND 4.8.3; older versions may compile, but they
have known bugs that should give you pause.

Common problems in old versions include "undefined" errors for
dn_skipname.

Some people have had a problem with BIND 4.9; it uses some routines
that it expects to be externally defined such as strerror().  It may
help to link with "-l44bsd" to solve this problem.  This has apparently
been fixed in later versions of BIND, starting around 4.9.3.  In other
words, if you use 4.9.0 through 4.9.2, you need -l44bsd; for earlier or
later versions, you do not.

!PLEASE! be sure to link with the same version of the resolver as
the header files you used -- some people have used the 4.9 headers
and linked with BIND 4.8 or vice versa, and it doesn't work.
Unfortunately, it doesn't fail in an obvious way -- things just
subtly don't work.

WILDCARD MX RECORDS ARE A BAD IDEA!  The only situation in which they
work reliably is if you have two versions of DNS, one in the real world
which has a wildcard pointing to your firewall, and a completely
different version of the database internally that does not include
wildcard MX records that match your domain.  ANYTHING ELSE WILL GIVE
YOU HEADACHES!

When attempting to canonify a hostname, some broken name servers will
return SERVFAIL (a temporary failure) on T_AAAA (IPv6) lookups.  If you
want to excuse this behavior, include WorkAroundBrokenAAAA in
ResolverOptions.  However, instead, we recommend catching the problem and
reporting it to the name server administrator so we can rid the world of
broken name servers.


+----------------------------------------+
| STARTTLS COMPILATION AND CONFIGURATION |
+----------------------------------------+

Please read the documentation accompanying the OpenSSL library.  You
have to compile and install the OpenSSL libraries before you can compile
sendmail.  See devtools/README how to set the correct compile time
parameters; you should at least set the following variables:

APPENDDEF(`conf_sendmail_ENVDEF', `-DSTARTTLS')
APPENDDEF(`conf_sendmail_LIBS', `-lssl -lcrypto')

If you have installed the OpenSSL libraries and include files in
a location that your C compiler doesn't use by default you should
set confINCDIRS and confLIBDIRS as explained in the first section:
BUILDING SENDMAIL.

Configuration information can be found in doc/op/op.me (required
certificates) and cf/README (how to tell sendmail about certificates).

To perform an initial test, connect to your sendmail daemon
(telnet localhost 25) and issue a EHLO localhost and see whether
250-STARTTLS
is in the response.  If it isn't, run the daemon with
-O LogLevel=14
and try again.  Then take a look at the logfile and see whether
there are any problems listed about permissions (unsafe files)
or the validity of X.509 certificates.

From: Garrett Wollman <wollman@lcs.mit.edu>

    If your certificate authority is hierarchical, and you only include
    the top-level CA certificate in the CACertFile file, some mail clients
    may be unable to infer the proper certificate chain when selecting a
    client certificate.  Including the bottom-level CA certificate(s) in
    the CACertFile file will allow these clients to work properly.  This
    is not necessary if you are not using client certificates for
    authentication, or if all your clients are running Sendmail or other
    programs using the OpenSSL library (which get it right automatically).
    In addition, some mail clients are totally incapable of using
    certificate authentication -- even some of those which already support
    SSL/TLS for confidentiality.

Further information can be found via:
http://www.sendmail.org/tips/


+------------------------------------+
| SASL COMPILATION AND CONFIGURATION |
+------------------------------------+

Please read the documentation accompanying the Cyrus SASL library
(INSTALL and README).  If you use Berkeley DB for Cyrus SASL then
you must compile sendmail with the same version of Berkeley DB.
See devtools/README for how to set the correct compile time parameters;
you should at least set the following variables:

APPENDDEF(`conf_sendmail_ENVDEF', `-DSASL')
APPENDDEF(`conf_sendmail_LIBS', `-lsasl')

If you have installed the Cyrus SASL library and include files in
a location that your C compiler doesn't use by default you should
set confINCDIRS and confLIBDIRS as explained in the first section:
BUILDING SENDMAIL.

You have to select and install authentication mechanisms and tell
sendmail where to find the sasl library and the include files (see
devtools/README for the parameters to set).  Set up the required
users and passwords as explained in the SASL documentation.  See
also cf/README for authentication related options (especially
DefaultAuthInfo if you want authentication between MTAs).

To perform an initial test, connect to your sendmail daemon
(telnet localhost 25) and issue a EHLO localhost and see whether
250-AUTH ....
is in the response.  If it isn't, run the daemon with
-O LogLevel=14
and try again.  Then take a look at the logfile and see whether
there are any security related problems listed (unsafe files).

| OPERATING SYSTEM AND COMPILE QUIRKS |
+-------------------------------------+

GCC problems
	When compiling with "gcc -O -Wall" specify "-DSM_OMIT_BOGUS_WARNINGS"
		too (see include/sm/cdefs.h for more info).

	*****************************************************************
	**  IMPORTANT:  DO NOT USE OPTIMIZATION (``-O'') IF YOU ARE    **
	**  RUNNING GCC 2.4.x or 2.5.x.  THERE IS A BUG IN THE GCC     **
	**  OPTIMIZER THAT CAUSES SENDMAIL COMPILES TO FAIL MISERABLY. **
	*****************************************************************

	Jim Wilson of Cygnus believes he has found the problem -- it will
	probably be fixed in GCC 2.5.6 -- but until this is verified, be
	very suspicious of gcc -O.  This problem is reported to have been
	fixed in gcc 2.6.

	A bug in gcc 2.5.5 caused problems compiling sendmail 8.6.5 with
	optimization on a Sparc.  If you are using gcc 2.5.5, youi should
	upgrade to the latest version of gcc.

	Apparently GCC 2.7.0 on the Pentium processor has optimization
	problems.  I recommend against using -O on that architecture.  This
	has been seen on FreeBSD 2.0.5 RELEASE.

	Solaris 2.X users should use version 2.7.2.3 over 2.7.2.

	We have been told there are problems with gcc 2.8.0.  If you are
	using this version, you should upgrade to 2.8.1 or later.

Berkeley DB
	Berkeley DB 4.1.x with x <= 24 does not work with sendmail.
	You need at least 4.1.25.

GDBM	GDBM does not work with sendmail because the additional
	security checks and file locking cause problems.  Unfortunately,
	gdbm does not provide a compile flag in its version of ndbm.h so
	the code can adapt.  Until the GDBM authors can fix these problems,
	GDBM will not be supported.  Please use Berkeley DB instead.

Configuration file location
	Up to 8.6, sendmail tried to find the sendmail.cf file in the same
	place as the vendors had put it, even when this was obviously
	stupid.  As of 8.7, sendmail ALWAYS looks for /etc/sendmail.cf.
	Beginning with 8.10, sendmail uses /etc/mail/sendmail.cf.
	You can get sendmail to use the stupid vendor .cf location by
	adding -DUSE_VENDOR_CF_PATH during compilation, but this may break
	support programs and scripts that need to find sendmail.cf.  You
	are STRONGLY urged to use symbolic links if you want to use the
	vendor location rather than changing the location in the sendmail
	binary.

	NETINFO systems use NETINFO to determine the location of
	sendmail.cf.  The full path to sendmail.cf is stored as the value of
	the "sendmail.cf" property in the "/locations/sendmail"
	subdirectory of NETINFO.  Set the value of this property to
	"/etc/mail/sendmail.cf" (without the quotes) to use this new
	default location for Sendmail 8.10.0 and higher.

ControlSocket permissions
	Paraphrased from BIND 8.2.1's README:

	Solaris and other pre-4.4BSD kernels do not respect ownership or
	protections on UNIX-domain sockets.  The short term fix for this is to
	override the default path and put such control sockets into root-
	owned directories which do not permit non-root to r/w/x through them.
	The long term fix is for all kernels to upgrade to 4.4BSD semantics.

HP MPE/iX
	The MPE-specific code within sendmail emulates a set-user-id root
	environment for the sendmail binary.  But there is no root uid 0 on
	MPE, nor is there any support for set-user-id programs.  Even when
	sendmail thinks it is running as uid 0, it will still have the file
	access rights of the underlying non-zero uid, but because sendmail is
	an MPE priv-mode program it will still be able to call setuid() to
	successfully switch to a new uid.

	MPE setgid() semantics don't quite work the way sendmail expects, so
	special emulation is done here also.

	This uid/gid emulation is enabled via the setuid/setgid file mode bits
	which are not currently used by MPE.  Code in libsm/mpeix.c examines
	these bits and enables emulation if they have been set, i.e.,
	chmod u+s,g+s /SENDMAIL/CURRENT/SENDMAIL.

SunOS 4.x (Solaris 1.x)
	You may have to use -lresolv on SunOS.  However, beware that
	this links in a new version of gethostbyname that does not
	understand NIS, so you must have all of your hosts in DNS.

	Some people have reported problems with the SunOS version of
	-lresolv and/or in.named, and suggest that you get a newer
	version.  The symptoms are delays when you connect to the
	SMTP server on a SunOS machine or having your domain added to
	addresses inappropriately.  There is a version of BIND
	version 4.9 on gatekeeper.DEC.COM in pub/BSD/bind/4.9.

	There is substantial disagreement about whether you can make
	this work with resolv+, which allows you to specify a search-path
	of services.  Some people report that it works fine, others
	claim it doesn't work at all (including causing sendmail to
	drop core when it tries to do multiple resolv+ lookups for a
	single job).  I haven't tried resolv+, as we use DNS exclusively.

	Should you want to try resolv+, it is on ftp.uu.net in
	/networking/ip/dns.

	Apparently getservbyname() can fail under moderate to high
	load under some circumstances.  This will exhibit itself as
	the message ``554 makeconnection: service "smtp" unknown''.
	The problem has been traced to one or more blank lines in
	/etc/services on the NIS server machine.  Delete these
	and it should work.  This info is thanks to Brian Bartholomew
	<bb@math.ufl.edu> of I-Kinetics, Inc.

	NOTE: The SunOS 4.X linker uses library paths specified during
	compilation using -L for run-time shared library searches.
	Therefore, it is vital that relative and unsafe directory paths not
	be used when compiling sendmail.

SunOS 4.0.2 (Sun 386i)
	Date: Fri, 25 Aug 1995 11:13:58 +0200 (MET DST)
	From: teus@oce.nl

	Sendmail 8.7.Beta.12 compiles and runs nearly out of the box with the
	following changes:
	* Don't use /usr/5bin in your PATH, but make /usr/5bin/uname
	  available as "uname" command.
	* Use the defines "-DBSD4_3 -DNAMED_BIND=0" in
	  devtools/OS/SunOS.4.0, which is selected via the "uname" command.
	I recommend to make available the db-library on the system first
	(and change the Makefile to use this library).
	Note that the sendmail.cf and aliases files are found in /etc.

SunOS 4.1.3, 4.1.3_U1
	Sendmail causes crashes on SunOS 4.1.3 and 4.1.3_U1.  According
	to Sun bug number 1077939:

	If an application does a getsockopt() on a SOCK_STREAM (TCP) socket
	after the other side of the connection has sent a TCP RESET for
	the stream, the kernel gets a Bus Trap in the tcp_ctloutput() or
	ip_ctloutput() routine.

	For 4.1.3, this is fixed in patch 100584-08, available on the
	Sunsolve 2.7.1 or later CDs.  For 4.1.3_U1, this was fixed in patch
	101790-01 (SunOS 4.1.3_U1: TCP socket and reset problems), later
	obsoleted by patch 102010-05.

	Sun patch 100584-08 is not currently publicly available on their
	ftp site but a user has reported it can be found at other sites
	using a web search engine.

Solaris 2.x (SunOS 5.x)
	To compile for Solaris, the Makefile built by Build must
	include a SOLARIS definition which reflects the Solaris version
	(i.e. -DSOLARIS=20400 for 2.4 or -DSOLARIS=20501 for 2.5.1).
	If you are using gcc, make sure -I/usr/include is not used (or
	it might complain about TopFrame).  If you are using Sun's cc,
	make sure /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc is used instead of /usr/ucb/cc
	(or it might complain about tm_zone).

	The Solaris 2.x (x <= 3) "syslog" function is apparently limited
	to something about 90 characters because of a kernel limitation.
	If you have source code, you can probably up this number.  You
	can get patches that fix this problem:  the patch ids are:

		Solaris 2.1	100834
		Solaris 2.2	100999
		Solaris 2.3	101318

	Be sure you have the appropriate patch installed or you won't
	see system logging.

Solaris 2.4 (SunOS 5.4)
	If you include /usr/lib at the end of your LD_LIBRARY_PATH you run
	the risk of getting the wrong libraries under some circumstances.
	This is because of a new feature in Solaris 2.4, described by
	Rod.Evans@Eng.Sun.COM:

	>> Prior to SunOS 5.4, any LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting was ignored by the
	>> runtime linker if the application was setxid (secure), thus your
	>> applications search path would be:
	>>
	>>	/usr/local/lib	LD_LIBRARY_PATH component - IGNORED
	>>	/usr/lib	LD_LIBRARY_PATH component - IGNORED
	>>	/usr/local/lib	RPATH - honored
	>>	/usr/lib	RPATH - honored
	>>
	>> the effect is that path 3 would be the first used, and this would
	>> satisfy your resolv.so lookup.
	>>
	>> In SunOS 5.4 we made the LD_LIBRARY_PATH a little more flexible.
	>> People who developed setxid applications wanted to be able to alter
	>> the library search path to some degree to allow for their own
	>> testing and debugging mechanisms.  It was decided that the only
	>> secure way to do this was to allow a `trusted' path to be used in
	>> LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  The only trusted directory we presently define
	>> is /usr/lib.  Thus a set-user-ID root developer could play with some
	>> alternative shared object implementations and place them in
	>> /usr/lib (being root we assume they'ed have access to write in this
	>> directory).  This change was made as part of 1155380 - after a
	>> *huge* amount of discussion regarding the security aspect of things.
	>>
	>> So, in SunOS 5.4 your applications search path would be:
	>>
	>>	/usr/local/lib	from LD_LIBRARY_PATH - IGNORED (untrustworthy)
	>>	/usr/lib	from LD_LIBRARY_PATH - honored (trustworthy)
	>>	/usr/local/lib	from RPATH - honored
	>>	/usr/lib	from RPATH - honored
	>>
	>> here, path 2 would be the first used.

Solaris 2.5.1 (SunOS 5.5.1) and 2.6 (SunOS 5.6)
	Apparently Solaris 2.5.1 patch 103663-01 installs a new
	/usr/include/resolv.h file that defines the __P macro without
	checking to see if it is already defined.  This new resolv.h is also
	included in the Solaris 2.6 distribution.  This causes compile
	warnings such as:

	   In file included from daemon.c:51:
	   /usr/include/resolv.h:208: warning: `__P' redefined
	   cdefs.h:58: warning: this is the location of the previous definition

	These warnings can be safely ignored or you can create a resolv.h
	file in the obj.SunOS.5.5.1.* or obj.SunOS.5.6.* directory that reads:

	   #undef __P
	   #include "/usr/include/resolv.h"

	This problem was fixed in Solaris 7 (Sun bug ID 4081053).

Solaris 7 (SunOS 5.7)
	Solaris 7 includes LDAP libraries but the implementation was
	lacking a few things.  The following settings can be placed in
	devtools/Site/site.SunOS.5.7.m4 if you plan on using those
	libraries.

	APPENDDEF(`confMAPDEF', `-DLDAPMAP')
	APPENDDEF(`confENVDEF', `-DLDAP_VERSION_MAX=3')
	APPENDDEF(`confLIBS', `-lldap')

	Also, Sun's patch 107555 is needed to prevent a crash in the call
	to ldap_set_option for LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS in ldapmap_setopts if
	LDAP support is compiled in sendmail.

Solaris 8 and later (SunOS 5.8 and later)
	Solaris 8 and later can optionally install LDAP support.  If you
	have installed the Entire Distribution meta-cluster, you can use
	the following in devtools/Site/site.SunOS.5.8.m4 (or other
	appropriately versioned file) to enable LDAP:

	APPENDDEF(`confMAPDEF', `-DLDAPMAP')
	APPENDDEF(`confLIBS', `-lldap')

Solaris 9 and later (SunOS 5.9 and later)
	Solaris 9 and later have a revised LDAP library, libldap.so.5,
	which is derived from a Netscape implementation, thus requiring
	that SM_CONF_LDAP_MEMFREE be defined in conjunction with LDAPMAP:

	APPENDDEF(`confMAPDEF', `-DLDAPMAP')
	APPENDDEF(`confENVDEF', `-DSM_CONF_LDAP_MEMFREE')
	APPENDDEF(`confLIBS', `-lldap')

Solaris
	If you are using dns for hostname resolution on Solaris, make sure
	that the 'dns' entry is last on the hosts line in
	'/etc/nsswitch.conf'.  For example, use:

		hosts:	nisplus files dns

	Do not use:

		hosts:  nisplus dns [NOTFOUND=return] files

	Note that 'nisplus' above is an illustration.  The same comment
	applies no matter what naming services you are using.  If you have
	anything other than dns last, even after "[NOTFOUND=return]",
	sendmail may not be able to determine whether an error was
	temporary or permanent.  The error returned by the solaris
	gethostbyname() is the error for the last lookup used, and other
	naming services do not have the same concept of temporary failure.

Ultrix
	By default, the IDENT protocol is turned off on Ultrix.  If you
	are running Ultrix 4.4 or later, or if you have included patch
	CXO-8919 for Ultrix 4.2 or 4.3 to fix the TCP problem, you can turn
	IDENT on in the configuration file by setting the "ident" timeout.

	The Ultrix 4.5 Y2K patch (ULTV45-022-1) has changed the resolver
	included in libc.a.  Unfortunately, the __RES symbol hasn't changed
	and therefore, sendmail can no longer automatically detect the
	newer version.  If you get a compiler error:

	/lib/libc.a(gethostent.o): local_hostname_length: multiply defined

	Then rebuild with this in devtools/Site/site.ULTRIX.m4:

	APPENDDEF(`conf_sendmail_ENVDEF', `-DNEEDLOCAL_HOSTNAME_LENGTH=0')

Digital UNIX (formerly DEC OSF/1)
	If you are compiling on OSF/1 (DEC Alpha), you must use
	-L/usr/shlib (otherwise it core dumps on startup).  You may also
	need -mld to get the nlist() function, although some versions
	apparently don't need this.

	Also, the enclosed makefile removed /usr/sbin/smtpd; if you need
	it, just create the link to the sendmail binary.

	On DEC OSF/1 3.2 or earlier, the MatchGECOS option doesn't work
	properly due to a bug in the getpw* routines.  If you want to use
	this, use -DDEC_OSF_BROKEN_GETPWENT=1.  The problem is fixed in 3.2C.

	Digital's mail delivery agent, /bin/mail (aka /bin/binmail), will
	only preserve the envelope sender in the "From " header if
	DefaultUserID is set to daemon.  Setting this to mailnull will
	cause all mail to have the header "From mailnull ...".  To use
	a different DefaultUserID, you will need to use a different mail
	delivery agent (such as mail.local found in the sendmail
	distribution).

	On Digital UNIX 4.0 and later, Berkeley DB 1.85 is included with the
	operating system and already has the ndbm.o module removed.  However,
	Digital has modified the original Berkeley DB db.h include file.
	This results in the following warning while compiling map.c and udb.c:

	cc: Warning: /usr/include/db.h, line 74: The redefinition of the macro

	------------------------^

	This warning can be ignored.

	Digital UNIX's linker checks /usr/ccs/lib/ before /usr/lib/.
	If you have installed a new version of BIND in /usr/include
	and /usr/lib, you will experience difficulties as Digital ships
	libresolv.a in /usr/ccs/lib/ as well.  Be sure to replace both
	copies of libresolv.a.

IRIX
	The header files on SGI IRIX are completely prototyped, and as
	a result you can sometimes get some warning messages during
	compilation.  These can be ignored.  There are two errors in
	deliver only if you are using gcc, both of the form ``warning:
	passing arg N of `execve' from incompatible pointer type''.
	Also, if you compile with -DNIS, you will get a complaint
	about a declaration of struct dom_binding in a prototype
	when compiling map.c; this is not important because the
	function being prototyped is not used in that file.

	In order to compile sendmail you will have had to install
	the developers' option in order to get the necessary include
	files.

	If you compile with -lmalloc (the fast memory allocator), you may
	get warning messages such as the following:

	   ld32: WARNING 85: definition of _calloc in /usr/lib32/libmalloc.so
		preempts that definition in /usr/lib32/mips3/libc.so.
	   ld32: WARNING 85: definition of _malloc in /usr/lib32/libmalloc.so
		preempts that definition in /usr/lib32/mips3/libc.so.
	   ld32: WARNING 85: definition of _realloc in /usr/lib32/libmalloc.so

	   ld32: WARNING 85: definition of _free in /usr/lib32/libmalloc.so

	   ld32: WARNING 85: definition of _cfree in /usr/lib32/libmalloc.so
		preempts that definition in /usr/lib32/mips3/libc.so.

	These are unavoidable and innocuous -- just ignore them.

	According to Dave Sill <de5@ornl.gov>, there is a version of the
	Berkeley DB library patched to run on Irix 6.2 available from
	http://reality.sgi.com/ariel/freeware/#db .

IRIX 6.x
	If you are using XFS filesystem, avoid using the -32 ABI switch to
	the cc compiler if possible.

	Broken inet_aton and inet_ntoa on IRIX using gcc: There's
	a problem with gcc on IRIX, i.e., gcc can't pass structs
	less than 16 bits long unless they are 8 bits; IRIX 6.2 has
	some other sized structs.  See
	http://www.bitmechanic.com/mail-archives/mysql/current/0418.html
	This problem seems to be fixed by gcc v2.95.2, gcc v2.8.1
	is reported as broken.  Check your gcc version for this bug
	before installing sendmail.

IRIX 6.4
	The IRIX 6.5.4 version of /bin/m4 does not work properly with
	sendmail.  Either install fw_m4.sw.m4 off the Freeware_May99 CD and
	use /usr/freeware/bin/m4 or install and use GNU m4.

NeXT or NEXTSTEP
	NEXTSTEP 3.3 and earlier ship with the old DBM library.  Also,
	Berkeley DB does not currently run on NEXTSTEP.

	If you are compiling on NEXTSTEP, you will have to create an
	empty file "unistd.h" and create a file "dirent.h" containing:

		#include <sys/dir.h>
		#define dirent	direct

	(devtools/OS/NeXT should try to do both of these for you.)

	Apparently, there is a bug in getservbyname on Nextstep 3.0
	that causes it to fail under some circumstances with the
	message "SYSERR: service "smtp" unknown" logged.  You should
	be able to work around this by including the line:

		OOPort=25

	in your .cf file.

BSDI (BSD/386) 1.0, NetBSD 0.9, FreeBSD 1.0
	The "m4" from BSDI won't handle the config files properly.
	I haven't had a chance to test this myself.

	The M4 shipped in FreeBSD and NetBSD 0.9 don't handle the config
	files properly.  One must use either GNU m4 1.1 or the PD-M4
	recently posted in comp.os.386bsd.bugs (and maybe others).
	NetBSD-current includes the PD-M4 (as stated in the NetBSD file
	CHANGES).

	FreeBSD 1.0 RELEASE has uname(2) now.  Use -DUSEUNAME in order to
	use it (look into devtools/OS/FreeBSD).  NetBSD-current may have
	it too but it has not been verified.

	The latest version of Berkeley DB uses a different naming
	scheme than the version that is supplied with your release.  This
	means you will be able to use the current version of Berkeley DB
	with sendmail as long you use the new db.h when compiling
	sendmail and link it against the new libdb.a or libdb.so.  You
	should probably keep the original db.h in /usr/include and the
	new db.h in /usr/local/include.

4.3BSD
	If you are running a "virgin" version of 4.3BSD, you'll have
	a very old resolver and be missing some header files.  The
	header files are simple -- create empty versions and everything
	will work fine.  For the resolver you should really port a new
	version (4.8.3 or later) of the resolver; 4.9 is available on
	gatekeeper.DEC.COM in pub/BSD/bind/4.9.  If you are really
	determined to continue to use your old, buggy version (or as
	a shortcut to get sendmail working -- I'm sure you have the
	best intentions to port a modern version of BIND), you can
	copy ../contrib/oldbind.compat.c into sendmail and add the
	following to devtools/Site/site.config.m4:

	APPENDDEF(`confOBJADD', `oldbind.compat.o')

OpenBSD (up to 2.9 Release), NetBSD, FreeBSD (up to 4.3-RELEASE)
	m4 from *BSD won't handle libsm/Makefile.m4 properly, since the
	maximum length for strings is too short.  You need to use GNU m4
	or patch m4, see for example:
  http://FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/usr.bin/m4/eval.c.diff?r1=1.11&r2=1.12

A/UX
	Date: Tue, 12 Oct 1993 18:28:28 -0400 (EDT)
	From: "Eric C. Hagberg" <hagberg@med.cornell.edu>
	Subject: Fix for A/UX ndbm

	I guess this isn't really a sendmail bug, however, it is something
	that A/UX users should be aware of when compiling sendmail 8.6.

	Apparently, the calls that sendmail is using to the ndbm routines
	in A/UX 3.0.x contain calls to "broken" routines, in that the
	aliases database will break when it gets "just a little big"
	(sorry I don't have exact numbers here, but it broke somewhere
	around 20-25 aliases for me.), making all aliases non-functional
	after exceeding this point.

	What I did was to get the gnu-dbm-1.6 package, compile it, and
	then re-compile sendmail with "-lgdbm", "-DNDBM", and using the
	ndbm.h header file that comes with the gnu-package.  This makes
	things behave properly.
	  [NOTE: see comment above about GDBM]

	I suppose porting the New Berkeley DB package is another route,
	however, I made a quick attempt at it, and found it difficult
	(not easy at least); the gnu-dbm package "configured" and
	compiled easily.

	  [NOTE: Berkeley DB version 2.X runs on A/UX and can be used for
	  database maps.]

SCO Unix
	From: Thomas Essebier <tom@stallion.oz.au>
	Organisation:  Stallion Technologies Pty Ltd.

	It will probably help those who are trying to configure sendmail 8.6.9
	to know that if they are on SCO, they had better set
		OI-dnsrch
	or they will core dump as soon as they try to use the resolver.
	i.e., although SCO has _res.dnsrch defined, and is kinda BIND 4.8.3,
	it does not inititialise it, nor does it understand 'search' in
	/etc/named.boot.
		- sigh -

	According to SCO, the m4 which ships with UnixWare 2.1.2 is broken.
	We recommend installing GNU m4 before attempting to build sendmail.

	On some versions a bogus error value is listed if connections
	time out (large negative number).  To avoid this explicitly set
	Timeout.connect to a reasonable value (several minutes).

DG/UX
	Doug Anderson <dlander@afterlife.ncsc.mil> has successfully run
	V8 on the DG/UX 5.4.2 and 5.4R3.x platforms under heavy usage.
	Originally, the DG /bin/mail program wasn't compatible with
	the V8 sendmail, since the DG /bin/mail requires the environment
	variable "_FORCE_MAIL_LOCAL_=yes" be set.  Version 8.7 now includes
	this in the environment before invoking the local mailer.  Some
	have used procmail to avoid this problem in the past.  It works
	but some have experienced file locking problems with their DG/UX
	ports of procmail.

Apollo DomainOS
	If you are compiling on Apollo, you will have to create an empty
	file "unistd.h" (for DomainOS 10.3 and earlier) and create a file
	"dirent.h" containing:

		#include <sys/dir.h>
		#define dirent	direct

	(devtools/OS/DomainOS will attempt to do both of these for you.)

HP-UX 8.00
	Date: Mon, 24 Jan 1994 13:25:45 +0200
	From: Kimmo Suominen <Kimmo.Suominen@lut.fi>
	Subject: 8.6.5 w/ HP-UX 8.00 on s300

	Just compiled and fought with sendmail 8.6.5 on a HP9000/360 (i.e.,
	a series 300 machine) running HP-UX 8.00.

	I was getting segmentation fault when delivering to a local user.
	With debugging I saw it was faulting when doing _free@libc... *sigh*
	It seems the new implementation of malloc on s300 is buggy as of 8.0,
	so I tried out the one in -lmalloc (malloc(3X)).  With that it seems
	to work just dandy.

	When linking, you will get the following error:

	ld: multiply defined symbol _freespace in file /usr/lib/libmalloc.a

	but you can just ignore it.  You might want to add this info to the
	README file for the future...

Linux
	Something broke between versions 0.99.13 and 0.99.14 of Linux: the
	flock() system call gives errors.  If you are running .14, you must
	not use flock.  You can do this with -DHASFLOCK=0.  We have also
	been getting complaints since version 2.4.X was released.
	sendmail 8.13 has changed the default locking method to fcntl()
	for Linux kernel version 2.4 and later.  Be sure to update other
	sendmail related programs to match locking techniques (some
	examples, besides makemap and mail.local, include procmail, mailx,
	mutt, elm, etc).

	Around the inclusion of bind-4.9.3 & Linux libc-4.6.20, the
	initialization of the _res structure changed.  If /etc/hosts.conf
	was configured as "hosts, bind" the resolver code could return
	"Name server failure" errors.  This is supposedly fixed in
	later versions of libc (>= 4.6.29?), and later versions of
	sendmail (> 8.6.10) try to work around the problem.

	Some older versions (< 4.6.20?) of the libc/include files conflict
	with sendmail's version of cdefs.h.  Deleting sendmail's version
	on those systems should be non-harmful, and new versions don't care.

	NOTE ON LINUX & BIND:  By default, the Makefile generated for Linux
	includes header files in /usr/local/include and libraries in
	/usr/local/lib.  If you've installed BIND on your system, the header
	files typically end up in the search path and you need to add
	"-lresolv" to the LIBS line in your Makefile.  Really old versions
	may need to include "-l44bsd" as well (particularly if the link phase
	complains about missing strcasecmp, strncasecmp or strpbrk).
	Complaints about an undefined reference to `__dn_skipname' in
	domain.o are a sure sign that you need to add -lresolv to LIBS.
	Newer versions of Linux are basically threaded BIND, so you may or
	may not see complaints if you accidentally mix BIND
	headers/libraries with virginal libc.  If you have BIND headers in
	/usr/local/include (resolv.h, etc) you *should* be adding -lresolv
	to LIBS.  Data structures may change and you'd be asking for a
	core dump.

	A number of problems have been reported regarding the Linux 2.2.0
	kernel.  So far, these problems have been tracked down to syslog()
	and DNS resolution.  We believe the problem is with the poll()
	implementation in the Linux 2.2.0 kernel and poll()-aware versions
	of glib (at least up to 2.0.111).

glibc
	glibc 2.2.1 (and possibly other versions) changed the value of
	__RES in resolv.h but failed to actually provide the IPv6 API
	changes that the change implied.  Therefore, compiling with
	-DNETINET6 fails.

	Workarounds:
	1) Compile without -DNETINET6
	2) Build against a real BIND 8.2.2 include/lib tree
	3) Wait for glibc to fix it

AIX 4.X
	The AIX 4.X linker uses library paths specified during compilation
	using -L for run-time shared library searches.  Therefore, it is
	vital that relative and unsafe directory paths not be using when
	compiling sendmail.  Because of this danger, by default, compiles
	on AIX use the -blibpath option to limit shared libraries to
	/usr/lib and /lib.  If you need to allow more directories, such as
	/usr/local/lib, modify your devtools/Site/site.AIX.4.2.m4,
	site.AIX.4.3.m4, and/or site.AIX.4.x.m4 file(s) and set confLDOPTS
	appropriately.  For example:

	define(`confLDOPTS', `-blibpath:/usr/lib:/lib:/usr/local/lib')

	Be sure to only add (safe) system directories.

	The AIX version of GNU ld also exhibits this problem.  If you are
	using that version, instead of -blibpath, use its -rpath option.
	For example:

	gcc -Wl,-rpath /usr/lib -Wl,-rpath /lib -Wl,-rpath /usr/local/lib

AIX 4.X	If the test program t-event (and most others) in libsm fails,
	check your compiler settings.  It seems that the flags -qnoro or
	-qnoroconst on some AIX versions trigger a compiler bug.  Check
	your compiler settings or use cc instead of xlc.

AIX 4.0-4.2, maybe some AIX 4.3 versions
	The AIX m4 implements a different mechanism for ifdef which is
	inconsistent with other versions of m4.  Therefore, it will not
	work properly with the sendmail Build architecture or m4
	configuration method.  To work around this problem, please use
	GNU m4 from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/.
	The problem seems to be solved in AIX 4.3.3 at least.

AIX 4.3.3
	From: Valdis.Kletnieks@vt.edu
	Date: Sun, 02 Jul 2000 03:58:02 -0400

	Under AIX 4.3.3, after applying bos.adt.include 4.3.3.12 to close the
	BIND 8.2.2 security holes, you can no longer build with  -DNETINET6
	because they changed the value of __RES in resolv.h but failed to
	actually provide the API changes that the change implied.

	Workarounds:
	1) Compile without -DNETINET6
	2) Build against a real BIND 8.2.2 include/lib tree
	3) Wait for IBM to fix it

AIX 3.x
	This version of sendmail does not support MB, MG, and MR resource
	records, which are supported by AIX sendmail.

	Several people have reported that the IBM-supplied named returns
	fairly random results -- the named should be replaced.  It is not
	necessary to replace the resolver, which will simplify installation.
	A new BIND resolver can be found at http://www.isc.org/isc/.

AIX 3.1.x
	The supplied load average code only works correctly for AIX 3.2.x.
	For 3.1, use -DLA_TYPE=LA_SUBR and get the latest ``monitor''
	package by Jussi Maki <jmaki@hut.fi> from ftp.funet.fi in the
	directory pub/unix/AIX/rs6000/monitor-1.12.tar.Z; use the loadavgd
	daemon, and the getloadavg subroutine supplied with that package.
	If you don't care about load average throttling, just turn off
	load average checking using -DLA_TYPE=LA_ZERO.

RISC/os
	RISC/os from MIPS is a merged AT&T/Berkeley system.  When you
	compile on that platform you will get duplicate definitions
	on many files.  You can ignore these.

System V Release 4 Based Systems
	There is a single devtools OS that is intended for all SVR4-based
	systems (built from devtools/OS/SVR4).  It defines __svr4__,
	which is predefined by some compilers.  If your compiler already
	defines this compile variable, you can delete the definition from
	the generated Makefile or create a devtools/Site/site.config.m4
	file.

	It's been tested on Dell Issue 2.2.

DELL SVR4
	Date:      Mon, 06 Dec 1993 10:42:29 EST
	From: "Kimmo Suominen" <kim@grendel.lut.fi>
	Message-ID: <2d0352f9.lento29@lento29.UUCP>
	To: eric@cs.berkeley.edu
	Cc: sendmail@cs.berkeley.edu
	Subject:   Notes for DELL SVR4

	Eric,

	Here are some notes for compiling Sendmail 8.6.4 on DELL SVR4.  I ran
	across these things when helping out some people who contacted me by
	e-mail.

	1) Use gcc 2.4.5 (or later?).  Dell distributes gcc 2.1 with their
	   Issue 2.2 Unix.  It is too old, and gives you problems with
	   clock.c, because sigset_t won't get defined in <sys/signal.h>.
	   This is due to a problematic protection rule in there, and is
	   fixed with gcc 2.4.5.

	2) If you don't use the new Berkeley DB (-DNEWDB), then you need
	   to add "-lc -lucb" to the libraries to link with.  This is because
	   the -ldbm distributed by Dell needs the bcopy, bcmp and bzero
	   functions.  It is important that you specify both libraries in
	   the given order to be sure you only get the BSTRING functions
	   from the UCB library (and not the signal routines etc.).

	3) Don't leave out "-lelf" even if compiling with "-lc -lucb".
	   The UCB library also has another copy of the nlist routines,
	   but we do want the ones from "-lelf".

	If anyone needs a compiled gcc 2.4.5 and/or a ported DB library, they
	can use anonymous ftp to fetch them from lut.fi in the /kim directory.
	They are copies of what I use on grendel.lut.fi, and offering them
	does not imply that I would also support them.  I have sent the DB
	port for SVR4 back to Keith Bostic for inclusion in the official
	distribution, but I haven't heard anything from him as of today.

	- gcc-2.4.5-svr4.tar.gz	(gcc 2.4.5 and the corresponding libg++)
	- db-1.72.tar.gz	(with source, objects and a installed copy)

	Cheers

ConvexOS 10.1 and below
	In order to use the name server, you must create the file
	/etc/use_nameserver.  If this file does not exist, the call
	to res_init() will fail and you will have absolutely no
	access to DNS, including MX records.

Amdahl UTS 2.1.5
	In order to get UTS to work, you will have to port BIND 4.9.
	The vendor's BIND is reported to be ``totally inadequate.''
	See sendmail/contrib/AmdahlUTS.patch for the patches necessary
	to get BIND 4.9 compiled for UTS.

UnixWare
	According to Alexander Kolbasov <sasha@unitech.gamma.ru>,
	the m4 on UnixWare 2.0 (still in Beta) will core dump on the
	config files.  GNU m4 and the m4 from UnixWare 1.x both work.

	According to Larry Rosenman <ler@lerami.lerctr.org>:

		UnixWare 2.1.[23]'s m4 chokes (not obviously) when
		processing the 8.9.0 cf files.

		I had a LOCAL_RULE_0 that wound up AFTER the
		SBasic_check_rcpt rules using the SCO supplied M4.
		GNU M4 works fine.

UNICOS 8.0.3.4
	Some people have reported that the -O flag on UNICOS can cause
	problems.  You may want to turn this off if you have problems
	running sendmail.  Reported by Jerry G. DeLapp <jgd@acl.lanl.gov>.

Darwin/Mac OS X (10.X.X)
	The linker errors produced regarding getopt() and its associated
	variables can safely be ignored.

	From Mike Zimmerman <zimmy@torrentnet.com>:

	From scratch here is what Darwin users need to do to the standard
	10.0.0, 10.0.1 install to get sendmail working.
	From http://www.macosx.com/forums/showthread.php?s=6dac0e9e1f3fd118a4870a8a9b559491&threadid=2242:
	1. chmod g-w / /private /private/etc
	2. Properly set HOSTNAME in /etc/hostconfig to your FQDN:
	   HOSTNAME=-my.domain.com-
	3. Edit /etc/rc.boot:
	   hostname my.domain.com
	   domainname domain.com
	4. Edit /System/Library/StartupItems/Sendmail/Sendmail:
	   Remove the "&" after the sendmail command:
	   /usr/sbin/sendmail -bd -q1h

	From Carsten Klapp <carsten.klapp@home.com>:

	The easiest workaround is to remove the group-writable permission
	for the root directory and the symbolic /etc inherits this
	change. While this does fix sendmail, the unfortunate side-effect
	is the OS X admin will no longer be able to manipulate icons in the
	top level of the Startup disk unless logged into the GUI as the
	superuser.

	In applying the alternate workaround, care must be taken while
	swapping the symlink /etc with the directory /private/etc. In all
	likelihood any admin who is concerned with this sendmail error has
	enough experience to not accidentally harm anything in the process.

	a. Swap the /etc symlink with /private/etc (as superuser):
	   rm /etc
	   mv /private/etc /etc
	   ln -s /etc /private/etc

	b. Set / to group unwritable (as superuser):
	   chmod g-w /

Darwin/Mac OS X (10.1.5)
	Apple's upgrade to sendmail 8.12 is incorrectly configured.  You
	will need to manually fix it up by doing the following:

	1. chown smmsp:smmsp /var/spool/clientmqueue
	2. chmod 2770 /var/spool/clientmqueue
	3. chgrp smmsp /usr/sbin/sendmail
	4. chmod g+s /usr/sbin/sendmail

	From Daniel J. Luke <dluke@geeklair.net>:

	It appears that setting the sendmail.cf property in
	/locations/sendmail in NetInfo on Mac OS X 10.1.5 with sendmail
	8.12.4 causes 'bad things' to happen.

	Specifically sendmail instances that should be getting their config
	from /etc/mail/submit.cf don't (so mail/mutt/perl scripts which
	open pipes to sendmail stop working as sendmail tries to write to
	/var/spool/mqueue and cannot as sendmail is no longer suid root).

	Removing the entry from NetInfo fixes this problem.

GNU getopt
	I'm told that GNU getopt has a problem in that it gets confused
	by the double call.  Use the version in conf.c instead.

BIND 4.9.2 and Ultrix
	If you are running on Ultrix, be sure you read conf/Info.Ultrix
	in the BIND distribution very carefully -- there is information
	in there that you need to know in order to avoid errors of the
	form:

		/lib/libc.a(gethostent.o): sethostent: multiply defined
		/lib/libc.a(gethostent.o): endhostent: multiply defined
		/lib/libc.a(gethostent.o): gethostbyname: multiply defined
		/lib/libc.a(gethostent.o): gethostbyaddr: multiply defined

	during the link stage.

BIND 8.X
	BIND 8.X returns HOST_NOT_FOUND instead of TRY_AGAIN on temporary
	DNS failures when trying to find the hostname associated with an IP
	address (gethostbyaddr()).  This can cause problems as
	$&{client_name} based lookups in class R ($=R) and the access
	database won't succeed.

	This will be fixed in BIND 8.2.1.  For earlier versions, this can
	be fixed by making "dns" the last name service queried for host
	resolution in /etc/irs.conf:

		hosts local continue
		hosts dns

strtoul
	Some compilers (notably gcc) claim to be ANSI C but do not
	include the ANSI-required routine "strtoul".  If your compiler
	has this problem, you will get an error in srvrsmtp.c on the
	code:

	  # ifdef defined(__STDC__) && !defined(BROKEN_ANSI_LIBRARY)
			e->e_msgsize = strtoul(vp, (char **) NULL, 10);
	  # else
			e->e_msgsize = strtol(vp, (char **) NULL, 10);
	  # endif

	You can use -DBROKEN_ANSI_LIBRARY to get around this problem.

Listproc 6.0c

	Message-ID: <95925101334.~INN-AUMa00187.comp-news@dl.ac.uk>
	From: alansz@mellers1.psych.berkeley.edu (Alan Schwartz)
	Subject: Listproc 6.0c + Sendmail 8.7 [Helpful hint]

	Just upgraded to sendmail 8.7, and discovered that listproc 6.0c
	breaks, because it, by default, sends a blank "HELO" rather than
	a "HELO hostname" when using the 'system' or 'telnet' mail method.

	The fix is to include -DZMAILER in the compilation, which will
	cause it to use "HELO hostname" (which Z-mail apparently requires
	as well. :)

OpenSSL
	OpenSSL versions prior to 0.9.6 use a macro named Free which
	conflicts with existing macro names on some platforms, such as
	AIX.
	Do not use 0.9.3, but OpenSSL 0.9.5a or later if compatible with
	0.9.5a.

PH
	PH support is provided by Mark Roth <roth@uiuc.edu>.  The map is
	described at http://www-dev.cites.uiuc.edu/sendmail/ .

	NOTE: The "spacedname" pseudo-field which was used by earlier
	versions of the PH map code is no longer supported!  See the URL
	listed above for more information.

	Please contact Mark Roth for support and questions regarding the
	map.

TCP Wrappers
	If you are using -DTCPWRAPPERS to get TCP Wrappers support you will
	also need to install libwrap.a and modify your site.config.m4 file
	or the generated Makefile to include -lwrap in the LIBS line
	(make sure that INCDIRS and LIBDIRS point to where the tcpd.h and
	libwrap.a can be found).

	TCP Wrappers is available at ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/.

	If you have alternate MX sites for your site, be sure that all of
	your MX sites reject the same set of hosts.  If not, a bad guy whom
	you reject will connect to your site, fail, and move on to the next
	MX site, which will accept the mail for you and forward it on to you.

Regular Expressions (MAP_REGEX)
	If sendmail linking fails with:

		undefined reference to 'regcomp'

	or sendmail gives an error about a regular expression with:

		pattern-compile-error: : Operation not applicable

	Your libc does not include a running version of POSIX-regex.  Use
	librx or regex.o from the GNU Free Software Foundation,
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/rx-?.?.tar.gz or
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/regex-?.?.tar.gz.
	You can also use the regex-lib by Henry Spencer,
	ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/C/spencer/regex.shar.gz
	Make sure, your compiler reads regex.h from the distribution,
	not from /usr/include, otherwise sendmail will dump a core.

Fedora Core 5, 64 bit version
	If the ld stage fails with undefined functions like
	__res_querydomain, __dn_expand
	then add these lines to devtools/Site/site.config.m4

	APPENDDEF(`confLIBDIRS', `-L/usr/lib64')
	APPENDDEF(`confINCDIRS', `-I/usr/include/bind9')

	and rebuild (sh ./Build -c).

	Problem noted by Daniel Krones, solution suggested by
	Anthony Howe.

| MANUAL PAGES |
+--------------+

The manual pages have been written against the -man macros, and
should format correctly with any reasonable *roff.


+-----------------+
| DEBUGGING HOOKS |
+-----------------+

As of 8.6.5, sendmail daemons will catch a SIGUSR1 signal and log
some debugging output (logged at LOG_DEBUG severity).  The
information dumped is:

 * The value of the $j macro.
 * A warning if $j is not in the set $=w.
 * A list of the open file descriptors.
 * The contents of the connection cache.
 * If ruleset 89 is defined, it is evaluated and the results printed.

This allows you to get information regarding the runtime state of the
daemon on the fly.  This should not be done too frequently, since
the process of rewriting may lose memory which will not be recovered.
Also, ruleset 89 may call non-reentrant routines, so there is a small
non-zero probability that this will cause other problems.  It is
really only for debugging serious problems.

A typical formulation of ruleset 89 would be:

	R$*		$@ $>0 some test address

		data structure and function declarations for bf.c.
collect.c	The routine that actually reads the mail into a temp
		file.  It also does a certain amount of parsing of
		the header, etc.
conf.c		The configuration file.  This contains information
		that is presumed to be quite static and non-
		controversial, or code compiled in for efficiency
		reasons.  Most of the configuration is in sendmail.cf.
