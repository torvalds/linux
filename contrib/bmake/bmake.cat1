[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mbmake [22mis a program designed to simplify the maintenance of other pro-
     grams.  Its input is a list of specifications as to the files upon which
     programs and other files depend.  If no [1m-f [4m[22mmakefile[24m makefile option is
     given, [1mbmake [22mwill try to open `[4mmakefile[24m' then `[4mMakefile[24m' in order to find
     the specifications.  If the file `[4m.depend[24m' exists, it is read (see
     mkdep(1)).

     This manual page is intended as a reference document only.  For a more
     thorough description of [1mbmake [22mand makefiles, please refer to [4mPMake[24m [4m-[24m [4mA[0m
     [4mTutorial[24m.

     [1mbmake [22mwill prepend the contents of the [4mMAKEFLAGS[24m environment variable to
     the command line arguments before parsing them.

     The options are as follows:

     [1m-B      [22mTry to be backwards compatible by executing a single shell per
             command and by executing the commands to make the sources of a
             dependency line in sequence.

     [1m-C [4m[22mdirectory[0m
             Change to [4mdirectory[24m before reading the makefiles or doing any-
             thing else.  If multiple [1m-C [22moptions are specified, each is inter-
             preted relative to the previous one: [1m-C [4m[22m/[24m [1m-C [4m[22metc[24m is equivalent to
             [1m-C [4m[22m/etc[24m.

     [1m-D [4m[22mvariable[0m
             Define [4mvariable[24m to be 1, in the global context.

     [1m-d [4m[22m[-]flags[0m
             Turn on debugging, and specify which portions of [1mbmake [22mare to
             print debugging information.  Unless the flags are preceded by
             `-' they are added to the [4mMAKEFLAGS[24m environment variable and will
             be processed by any child make processes.  By default, debugging
             information is printed to standard error, but this can be changed
             using the [4mF[24m debugging flag.  The debugging output is always
             unbuffered; in addition, if debugging is enabled but debugging
             output is not directed to standard output, then the standard out-
             put is line buffered.  [4mFlags[24m is one or more of the following:

             [4mA[24m       Print all possible debugging information; equivalent to
                     specifying all of the debugging flags.

             [4ma[24m       Print debugging information about archive searching and
                     caching.

             [4mC[24m       Print debugging information about current working direc-
                     tory.

             [4mc[24m       Print debugging information about conditional evaluation.

             [4md[24m       Print debugging information about directory searching and
                     caching.

             [4me[24m       Print debugging information about failed commands and
                     targets.

             [4mF[24m[[1m+[22m][4mfilename[0m
                     Specify where debugging output is written.  This must be
                     the last flag, because it consumes the remainder of the
                     argument.  If the character immediately after the `F'
                     flag is `+', then the file will be opened in append mode;
                     otherwise the file will be overwritten.  If the file name
                     is `stdout' or `stderr' then debugging output will be
                     written to the standard output or standard error output
                     file descriptors respectively (and the `+' option has no
                     effect).  Otherwise, the output will be written to the
                     named file.  If the file name ends `.%d' then the `%d' is
                     replaced by the pid.

             [4mf[24m       Print debugging information about loop evaluation.

             [4mg1[24m      Print the input graph before making anything.

             [4mg2[24m      Print the input graph after making everything, or before
                     exiting on error.

             [4mg3[24m      Print the input graph before exiting on error.

             [4mj[24m       Print debugging information about running multiple
                     shells.

             [4ml[24m       Print commands in Makefiles regardless of whether or not
                     they are prefixed by `@' or other "quiet" flags.  Also
                     known as "loud" behavior.

             [4mM[24m       Print debugging information about "meta" mode decisions
                     about targets.

             [4mm[24m       Print debugging information about making targets, includ-
                     ing modification dates.

             [4mn[24m       Don't delete the temporary command scripts created when
                     running commands.  These temporary scripts are created in
                     the directory referred to by the TMPDIR environment vari-
                     able, or in [4m/tmp[24m if TMPDIR is unset or set to the empty
                     string.  The temporary scripts are created by mkstemp(3),
                     and have names of the form [4mmakeXXXXXX[24m.  [4mNOTE[24m: This can
                     create many files in TMPDIR or [4m/tmp[24m, so use with care.

             [4mp[24m       Print debugging information about makefile parsing.

             [4ms[24m       Print debugging information about suffix-transformation
                     rules.

             [4mV[24m       Force the [1m-V [22moption to print raw values of variables,
                     overriding the default behavior set via
                     [4m.MAKE.EXPAND_VARIABLES[24m.

             [4mv[24m       Print debugging information about variable assignment.

             [4mx[24m       Run shell commands with [1m-x [22mso the actual commands are
                     printed as they are executed.

     [1m-e      [22mSpecify that environment variables override macro assignments
             within makefiles.

     [1m-f [4m[22mmakefile[0m
             Specify a makefile to read instead of the default `[4mmakefile[24m'.  If
             [4mmakefile[24m is `[1m-[22m', standard input is read.  Multiple makefiles may
             be specified, and are read in the order specified.

     [1m-I [4m[22mdirectory[0m
             Specify a directory in which to search for makefiles and included
             makefiles.  The system makefile directory (or directories, see
             the [1m-m [22moption) is automatically included as part of this list.

     [1m-i      [22mIgnore non-zero exit of shell commands in the makefile.  Equiva-
             lent to specifying `[1m-[22m' before each command line in the makefile.

     [1m-J [4m[22mprivate[0m
             This option should [4mnot[24m be specified by the user.

             When the [4mj[24m option is in use in a recursive build, this option is
             passed by a make to child makes to allow all the make processes
             in the build to cooperate to avoid overloading the system.

     [1m-j [4m[22mmax_jobs[0m
             Specify the maximum number of jobs that [1mbmake [22mmay have running at
             any one time.  The value is saved in [4m.MAKE.JOBS[24m.  Turns compati-
             bility mode off, unless the [4mB[24m flag is also specified.  When com-
             patibility mode is off, all commands associated with a target are
             executed in a single shell invocation as opposed to the tradi-
             tional one shell invocation per line.  This can break traditional
             scripts which change directories on each command invocation and
             then expect to start with a fresh environment on the next line.
             It is more efficient to correct the scripts rather than turn
             backwards compatibility on.

     [1m-k      [22mContinue processing after errors are encountered, but only on
             those targets that do not depend on the target whose creation
             caused the error.

     [1m-m [4m[22mdirectory[0m
             Specify a directory in which to search for sys.mk and makefiles
             included via the <[4mfile[24m>-style include statement.  The [1m-m [22moption
             can be used multiple times to form a search path.  This path will
             override the default system include path: /usr/share/mk.  Fur-
             thermore the system include path will be appended to the search
             path used for "[4mfile[24m"-style include statements (see the [1m-I[0m
             option).

             If a file or directory name in the [1m-m [22margument (or the
             MAKESYSPATH environment variable) starts with the string ".../"
             then [1mbmake [22mwill search for the specified file or directory named
             in the remaining part of the argument string.  The search starts
             with the current directory of the Makefile and then works upward
             towards the root of the file system.  If the search is success-
             ful, then the resulting directory replaces the ".../" specifica-
             tion in the [1m-m [22margument.  If used, this feature allows [1mbmake [22mto
             easily search in the current source tree for customized sys.mk
             files (e.g., by using ".../mk/sys.mk" as an argument).

     [1m-n      [22mDisplay the commands that would have been executed, but do not
             actually execute them unless the target depends on the .MAKE spe-
             cial source (see below).

     [1m-N      [22mDisplay the commands which would have been executed, but do not
             actually execute any of them; useful for debugging top-level
             makefiles without descending into subdirectories.

     [1m-q      [22mDo not execute any commands, but exit 0 if the specified targets
             are up-to-date and 1, otherwise.

     [1m-r      [22mDo not use the built-in rules specified in the system makefile.

     [1m-s      [22mDo not echo any commands as they are executed.  Equivalent to
             specifying `[1m@[22m' before each command line in the makefile.

     [1m-T [4m[22mtracefile[0m
             When used with the [1m-j [22mflag, append a trace record to [4mtracefile[0m
             for each job started and completed.

     [1m-t      [22mRather than re-building a target as specified in the makefile,
             create it or update its modification time to make it appear up-
             to-date.

     [1m-V [4m[22mvariable[0m
             Print the value of [4mvariable[24m.  Do not build any targets.  Multiple
             instances of this option may be specified; the variables will be
             printed one per line, with a blank line for each null or unde-
             fined variable.  The value printed is extracted from the global
             context after all makefiles have been read.  By default, the raw
             variable contents (which may include additional unexpanded vari-
             able references) are shown.  If [4mvariable[24m contains a `$' then the
             value will be recursively expanded to its complete resultant text
             before printing.  The expanded value will also be printed if
             [4m.MAKE.EXPAND_VARIABLES[24m is set to true and the [1m-dV [22moption has not
             been used to override it.  Note that loop-local and target-local
             variables, as well as values taken temporarily by global vari-
             ables during makefile processing, are not accessible via this
             option.  The [1m-dv [22mdebug mode can be used to see these at the cost
             of generating substantial extraneous output.

     [1m-v [4m[22mvariable[0m
             Like [1m-V [22mbut the variable is always expanded to its complete
             value.

     [1m-W      [22mTreat any warnings during makefile parsing as errors.

     [1m-w      [22mPrint entering and leaving directory messages, pre and post pro-
             cessing.

     [1m-X      [22mDon't export variables passed on the command line to the environ-
             ment individually.  Variables passed on the command line are
             still exported via the [4mMAKEFLAGS[24m environment variable.  This
             option may be useful on systems which have a small limit on the
             size of command arguments.

     [4mvariable=value[0m
             Set the value of the variable [4mvariable[24m to [4mvalue[24m.  Normally, all
             values passed on the command line are also exported to sub-makes
             in the environment.  The [1m-X [22mflag disables this behavior.  Vari-
             able assignments should follow options for POSIX compatibility
             but no ordering is enforced.

     There are seven different types of lines in a makefile: file dependency
     specifications, shell commands, variable assignments, include statements,
     conditional directives, for loops, and comments.

     In general, lines may be continued from one line to the next by ending
     them with a backslash (`\').  The trailing newline character and initial
     whitespace on the following line are compressed into a single space.

[1mFILE DEPENDENCY SPECIFICATIONS[0m
     Dependency lines consist of one or more targets, an operator, and zero or
     more sources.  This creates a relationship where the targets ``depend''
     on the sources and are usually created from them.  The exact relationship
     between the target and the source is determined by the operator that sep-
     arates them.  The three operators are as follows:

     [1m:     [22mA target is considered out-of-date if its modification time is less
           than those of any of its sources.  Sources for a target accumulate
           over dependency lines when this operator is used.  The target is
           removed if [1mbmake [22mis interrupted.

     [1m!     [22mTargets are always re-created, but not until all sources have been
           examined and re-created as necessary.  Sources for a target accumu-
           late over dependency lines when this operator is used.  The target
           is removed if [1mbmake [22mis interrupted.

     [1m::    [22mIf no sources are specified, the target is always re-created.  Oth-
           erwise, a target is considered out-of-date if any of its sources
           has been modified more recently than the target.  Sources for a
           target do not accumulate over dependency lines when this operator
           is used.  The target will not be removed if [1mbmake [22mis interrupted.

     Targets and sources may contain the shell wildcard values `?', `*', `[]',
     and `{}'.  The values `?', `*', and `[]' may only be used as part of the
     final component of the target or source, and must be used to describe
     existing files.  The value `{}' need not necessarily be used to describe
     existing files.  Expansion is in directory order, not alphabetically as
     done in the shell.

[1mSHELL COMMANDS[0m
     Each target may have associated with it one or more lines of shell com-
     mands, normally used to create the target.  Each of the lines in this
     script [4mmust[24m be preceded by a tab.  (For historical reasons, spaces are
     not accepted.)  While targets can appear in many dependency lines if
     desired, by default only one of these rules may be followed by a creation
     script.  If the `[1m::[22m' operator is used, however, all rules may include
     scripts and the scripts are executed in the order found.

     Each line is treated as a separate shell command, unless the end of line
     is escaped with a backslash (`\') in which case that line and the next
     are combined.  If the first characters of the command are any combination
     of `[1m@[22m', `[1m+[22m', or `[1m-[22m', the command is treated specially.  A `[1m@[22m' causes the
     command not to be echoed before it is executed.  A `[1m+[22m' causes the command
     to be executed even when [1m-n [22mis given.  This is similar to the effect of
     the .MAKE special source, except that the effect can be limited to a sin-
     gle line of a script.  A `[1m-[22m' in compatibility mode causes any non-zero
     exit status of the command line to be ignored.

     When [1mbmake [22mis run in jobs mode with [1m-j [4m[22mmax_jobs[24m, the entire script for
     the target is fed to a single instance of the shell.  In compatibility
     (non-jobs) mode, each command is run in a separate process.  If the com-
     mand contains any shell meta characters (`#=|^(){};&<>*?[]:$`\\n') it
     will be passed to the shell; otherwise [1mbmake [22mwill attempt direct execu-
     tion.  If a line starts with `[1m-[22m' and the shell has ErrCtl enabled then
     failure of the command line will be ignored as in compatibility mode.
     Otherwise `[1m-[22m' affects the entire job; the script will stop at the first
     command line that fails, but the target will not be deemed to have
     failed.

     Makefiles should be written so that the mode of [1mbmake [22moperation does not
     change their behavior.  For example, any command which needs to use
     ``cd'' or ``chdir'' without potentially changing the directory for subse-
     quent commands should be put in parentheses so it executes in a subshell.
     To force the use of one shell, escape the line breaks so as to make the
     whole script one command.  For example:

           avoid-chdir-side-effects:
                   @echo Building $@ in `pwd`
                   @(cd ${.CURDIR} && ${MAKE} $@)
                   @echo Back in `pwd`

           ensure-one-shell-regardless-of-mode:
                   @echo Building $@ in `pwd`; \
                   (cd ${.CURDIR} && ${MAKE} $@); \
                   echo Back in `pwd`

     Since [1mbmake [22mwill chdir(2) to `[4m.OBJDIR[24m' before executing any targets, each
     child process starts with that as its current working directory.

[1mVARIABLE ASSIGNMENTS[0m
     Variables in make are much like variables in the shell, and, by tradi-
     tion, consist of all upper-case letters.

   [1mVariable assignment modifiers[0m
     The five operators that can be used to assign values to variables are as
     follows:

     [1m=       [22mAssign the value to the variable.  Any previous value is overrid-
             den.

     [1m+=      [22mAppend the value to the current value of the variable.

     [1m?=      [22mAssign the value to the variable if it is not already defined.

     [1m:=      [22mAssign with expansion, i.e. expand the value before assigning it
             to the variable.  Normally, expansion is not done until the vari-
             able is referenced.  [4mNOTE[24m: References to undefined variables are
             [4mnot[24m expanded.  This can cause problems when variable modifiers
             are used.

     [1m!=      [22mExpand the value and pass it to the shell for execution and
             assign the result to the variable.  Any newlines in the result
             are replaced with spaces.

     Any white-space before the assigned [4mvalue[24m is removed; if the value is
     being appended, a single space is inserted between the previous contents
     of the variable and the appended value.

     Variables are expanded by surrounding the variable name with either curly
     braces (`{}') or parentheses (`()') and preceding it with a dollar sign
     (`$').  If the variable name contains only a single letter, the surround-
     ing braces or parentheses are not required.  This shorter form is not
     recommended.

     If the variable name contains a dollar, then the name itself is expanded
     first.  This allows almost arbitrary variable names, however names con-
     taining dollar, braces, parenthesis, or whitespace are really best
     avoided!

     If the result of expanding a variable contains a dollar sign (`$') the
     string is expanded again.

     Variable substitution occurs at three distinct times, depending on where
     the variable is being used.

     1.   Variables in dependency lines are expanded as the line is read.

     2.   Variables in shell commands are expanded when the shell command is
          executed.

     3.   ``.for'' loop index variables are expanded on each loop iteration.
          Note that other variables are not expanded inside loops so the fol-
          lowing example code:


                .for i in 1 2 3
                a+=     ${i}
                j=      ${i}
                b+=     ${j}
                .endfor

                all:
                        @echo ${a}
                        @echo ${b}

          will print:

                1 2 3
                3 3 3

          Because while ${a} contains ``1 2 3'' after the loop is executed,
          ${b} contains ``${j} ${j} ${j}'' which expands to ``3 3 3'' since
          after the loop completes ${j} contains ``3''.

   [1mVariable classes[0m
     The four different classes of variables (in order of increasing prece-
     dence) are:

     Environment variables
             Variables defined as part of [1mbmake[22m's environment.

     Global variables
             Variables defined in the makefile or in included makefiles.

     Command line variables
             Variables defined as part of the command line.

     Local variables
             Variables that are defined specific to a certain target.

     Local variables are all built in and their values vary magically from
     target to target.  It is not currently possible to define new local vari-
     ables.  The seven local variables are as follows:

           [4m.ALLSRC[24m   The list of all sources for this target; also known as
                     `[4m>[24m'.

           [4m.ARCHIVE[24m  The name of the archive file; also known as `[4m![24m'.

           [4m.IMPSRC[24m   In suffix-transformation rules, the name/path of the
                     source from which the target is to be transformed (the
                     ``implied'' source); also known as `[4m<[24m'.  It is not
                     defined in explicit rules.

           [4m.MEMBER[24m   The name of the archive member; also known as `[4m%[24m'.

           [4m.OODATE[24m   The list of sources for this target that were deemed out-
                     of-date; also known as `[4m?[24m'.

           [4m.PREFIX[24m   The file prefix of the target, containing only the file
                     portion, no suffix or preceding directory components;
                     also known as `[4m*[24m'.  The suffix must be one of the known
                     suffixes declared with [1m.SUFFIXES [22mor it will not be recog-
                     nized.

           [4m.TARGET[24m   The name of the target; also known as `[4m@[24m'.  For compati-
                     bility with other makes this is an alias for [1m.ARCHIVE [22min
                     archive member rules.

     The shorter forms (`[4m>[24m', `[4m![24m', `[4m<[24m', `[4m%[24m', `[4m?[24m', `[4m*[24m', and `[4m@[24m') are permitted
     for backward compatibility with historical makefiles and legacy POSIX
     make and are not recommended.

     Variants of these variables with the punctuation followed immediately by
     `D' or `F', e.g.  `[4m$(@D)[24m', are legacy forms equivalent to using the `:H'
     and `:T' modifiers.  These forms are accepted for compatibility with AT&T
     System V UNIX makefiles and POSIX but are not recommended.

     Four of the local variables may be used in sources on dependency lines
     because they expand to the proper value for each target on the line.
     These variables are `[4m.TARGET[24m', `[4m.PREFIX[24m', `[4m.ARCHIVE[24m', and `[4m.MEMBER[24m'.

   [1mAdditional built-in variables[0m
     In addition, [1mbmake [22msets or knows about the following variables:

     [4m$[24m               A single dollar sign `$', i.e.  `$$' expands to a single
                     dollar sign.

     [4m.ALLTARGETS[24m     The list of all targets encountered in the Makefile.  If
                     evaluated during Makefile parsing, lists only those tar-
                     gets encountered thus far.

     [4m.CURDIR[24m         A path to the directory where [1mbmake [22mwas executed.  Refer
                     to the description of `PWD' for more details.

     [4m.INCLUDEDFROMDIR[0m
                     The directory of the file this Makefile was included
                     from.

     [4m.INCLUDEDFROMFILE[0m
                     The filename of the file this Makefile was included from.

     MAKE            The name that [1mbmake [22mwas executed with ([4margv[0][24m).  For
                     compatibility [1mbmake [22malso sets [4m.MAKE[24m with the same value.
                     The preferred variable to use is the environment variable
                     MAKE because it is more compatible with other versions of
                     [1mbmake [22mand cannot be confused with the special target with
                     the same name.

     [4m.MAKE.DEPENDFILE[0m
                     Names the makefile (default `[4m.depend[24m') from which gener-
                     ated dependencies are read.

     [4m.MAKE.EXPAND_VARIABLES[0m
                     A boolean that controls the default behavior of the [1m-V[0m
                     option.  If true, variable values printed with [1m-V [22mare
                     fully expanded; if false, the raw variable contents
                     (which may include additional unexpanded variable refer-
                     ences) are shown.

     [4m.MAKE.EXPORTED[24m  The list of variables exported by [1mbmake[22m.

     [4m.MAKE.JOBS[24m      The argument to the [1m-j [22moption.

     [4m.MAKE.JOB.PREFIX[0m
                     If [1mbmake [22mis run with [4mj[24m then output for each target is
                     prefixed with a token `--- target ---' the first part of
                     which can be controlled via [4m.MAKE.JOB.PREFIX[24m.  If
                     [4m.MAKE.JOB.PREFIX[24m is empty, no token is printed.
                     For example:
                     .MAKE.JOB.PREFIX=${.newline}---${.MAKE:T}[${.MAKE.PID}]
                     would produce tokens like `---make[1234] target ---' mak-
                     ing it easier to track the degree of parallelism being
                     achieved.

     MAKEFLAGS       The environment variable `MAKEFLAGS' may contain anything
                     that may be specified on [1mbmake[22m's command line.  Anything
                     specified on [1mbmake[22m's command line is appended to the
                     `MAKEFLAGS' variable which is then entered into the envi-
                     ronment for all programs which [1mbmake [22mexecutes.

     [4m.MAKE.LEVEL[24m     The recursion depth of [1mbmake[22m.  The initial instance of
                     [1mbmake [22mwill be 0, and an incremented value is put into the
                     environment to be seen by the next generation.  This
                     allows tests like: .if ${.MAKE.LEVEL} == 0 to protect
                     things which should only be evaluated in the initial
                     instance of [1mbmake[22m.

     [4m.MAKE.MAKEFILE_PREFERENCE[0m
                     The ordered list of makefile names (default `[4mmakefile[24m',
                     `[4mMakefile[24m') that [1mbmake [22mwill look for.

     [4m.MAKE.MAKEFILES[0m
                     The list of makefiles read by [1mbmake[22m, which is useful for
                     tracking dependencies.  Each makefile is recorded only
                     once, regardless of the number of times read.

     [4m.MAKE.MODE[24m      Processed after reading all makefiles.  Can affect the
                     mode that [1mbmake [22mruns in.  It can contain a number of key-
                     words:

                     [4mcompat[24m               Like [1m-B[22m, puts [1mbmake [22minto "compat"
                                          mode.

                     [4mmeta[24m                 Puts [1mbmake [22minto "meta" mode, where
                                          meta files are created for each tar-
                                          get to capture the command run, the
                                          output generated and if filemon(4)
                                          is available, the system calls which
                                          are of interest to [1mbmake[22m.  The cap-
                                          tured output can be very useful when
                                          diagnosing errors.

                     [4mcurdirOk=[24m [4mbf[24m         Normally [1mbmake [22mwill not create .meta
                                          files in `[4m.CURDIR[24m'.  This can be
                                          overridden by setting [4mbf[24m to a value
                                          which represents True.

                     [4mmissing-meta=[24m [4mbf[24m     If [4mbf[24m is True, then a missing .meta
                                          file makes the target out-of-date.

                     [4mmissing-filemon=[24m [4mbf[24m  If [4mbf[24m is True, then missing filemon
                                          data makes the target out-of-date.

                     [4mnofilemon[24m            Do not use filemon(4).

                     [4menv[24m                  For debugging, it can be useful to
                                          include the environment in the .meta
                                          file.

                     [4mverbose[24m              If in "meta" mode, print a clue
                                          about the target being built.  This
                                          is useful if the build is otherwise
                                          running silently.  The message
                                          printed the value of:
                                          [4m.MAKE.META.PREFIX[24m.

                     [4mignore-cmd[24m           Some makefiles have commands which
                                          are simply not stable.  This keyword
                                          causes them to be ignored for deter-
                                          mining whether a target is out of
                                          date in "meta" mode.  See also
                                          [1m.NOMETA_CMP[22m.

                     [4msilent=[24m [4mbf[24m           If [4mbf[24m is True, when a .meta file is
                                          created, mark the target [1m.SILENT[22m.

     [4m.MAKE.META.BAILIWICK[0m
                     In "meta" mode, provides a list of prefixes which match
                     the directories controlled by [1mbmake[22m.  If a file that was
                     generated outside of [4m.OBJDIR[24m but within said bailiwick is
                     missing, the current target is considered out-of-date.

     [4m.MAKE.META.CREATED[0m
                     In "meta" mode, this variable contains a list of all the
                     meta files updated.  If not empty, it can be used to
                     trigger processing of [4m.MAKE.META.FILES[24m.

     [4m.MAKE.META.FILES[0m
                     In "meta" mode, this variable contains a list of all the
                     meta files used (updated or not).  This list can be used
                     to process the meta files to extract dependency informa-
                     tion.

     [4m.MAKE.META.IGNORE_PATHS[0m
                     Provides a list of path prefixes that should be ignored;
                     because the contents are expected to change over time.
                     The default list includes: `[4m/dev[24m [4m/etc[24m [4m/proc[24m [4m/tmp[24m [4m/var/run[0m
                     [4m/var/tmp[24m'

     [4m.MAKE.META.IGNORE_PATTERNS[0m
                     Provides a list of patterns to match against pathnames.
                     Ignore any that match.

     [4m.MAKE.META.IGNORE_FILTER[0m
                     Provides a list of variable modifiers to apply to each
                     pathname.  Ignore if the expansion is an empty string.

     [4m.MAKE.META.PREFIX[0m
                     Defines the message printed for each meta file updated in
                     "meta verbose" mode.  The default value is:
                           Building ${.TARGET:H:tA}/${.TARGET:T}

     [4m.MAKEOVERRIDES[24m  This variable is used to record the names of variables
                     assigned to on the command line, so that they may be
                     exported as part of `MAKEFLAGS'.  This behavior can be
                     disabled by assigning an empty value to `[4m.MAKEOVERRIDES[24m'
                     within a makefile.  Extra variables can be exported from
                     a makefile by appending their names to `[4m.MAKEOVERRIDES[24m'.
                     `MAKEFLAGS' is re-exported whenever `[4m.MAKEOVERRIDES[24m' is
                     modified.

     [4m.MAKE.PATH_FILEMON[0m
                     If [1mbmake [22mwas built with filemon(4) support, this is set
                     to the path of the device node.  This allows makefiles to
                     test for this support.

     [4m.MAKE.PID[24m       The process-id of [1mbmake[22m.

     [4m.MAKE.PPID[24m      The parent process-id of [1mbmake[22m.

     [4m.MAKE.SAVE_DOLLARS[0m
                     value should be a boolean that controls whether `$$' are
                     preserved when doing `:=' assignments.  The default is
                     false, for backwards compatibility.  Set to true for com-
                     patability with other makes.  If set to false, `$$'
                     becomes `$' per normal evaluation rules.

     [4mMAKE_PRINT_VAR_ON_ERROR[0m
                     When [1mbmake [22mstops due to an error, it sets `[4m.ERROR_TARGET[24m'
                     to the name of the target that failed, `[4m.ERROR_CMD[24m' to
                     the commands of the failed target, and in "meta" mode, it
                     also sets `[4m.ERROR_CWD[24m' to the getcwd(3), and
                     `[4m.ERROR_META_FILE[24m' to the path of the meta file (if any)
                     describing the failed target.  It then prints its name
                     and the value of `[4m.CURDIR[24m' as well as the value of any
                     variables named in `[4mMAKE_PRINT_VAR_ON_ERROR[24m'.

     [4m.newline[24m        This variable is simply assigned a newline character as
                     its value.  This allows expansions using the [1m:@ [22mmodifier
                     to put a newline between iterations of the loop rather
                     than a space.  For example, the printing of
                     `[4mMAKE_PRINT_VAR_ON_ERROR[24m' could be done as
                     ${MAKE_PRINT_VAR_ON_ERROR:@v@$v='${$v}'${.newline}@}.

     [4m.OBJDIR[24m         A path to the directory where the targets are built.  Its
                     value is determined by trying to chdir(2) to the follow-
                     ing directories in order and using the first match:

                     1.   ${MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX}${.CURDIR}

                          (Only if `MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX' is set in the environ-
                          ment or on the command line.)

                     2.   ${MAKEOBJDIR}

                          (Only if `MAKEOBJDIR' is set in the environment or
                          on the command line.)

                     3.   ${.CURDIR}[4m/obj.[24m${MACHINE}

                     4.   ${.CURDIR}[4m/obj[0m

                     5.   [4m/usr/obj/[24m${.CURDIR}

                     6.   ${.CURDIR}

                     Variable expansion is performed on the value before it's
                     used, so expressions such as
                           ${.CURDIR:S,^/usr/src,/var/obj,}
                     may be used.  This is especially useful with
                     `MAKEOBJDIR'.

                     `[4m.OBJDIR[24m' may be modified in the makefile via the special
                     target `[1m.OBJDIR[22m'.  In all cases, [1mbmake [22mwill chdir(2) to
                     the specified directory if it exists, and set `[4m.OBJDIR[24m'
                     and `PWD' to that directory before executing any targets.

     [4m.PARSEDIR[24m       A path to the directory of the current `[4mMakefile[24m' being
                     parsed.

     [4m.PARSEFILE[24m      The basename of the current `[4mMakefile[24m' being parsed.
                     This variable and `[4m.PARSEDIR[24m' are both set only while the
                     `[4mMakefiles[24m' are being parsed.  If you want to retain
                     their current values, assign them to a variable using
                     assignment with expansion: (`[1m:=[22m').

     [4m.PATH[24m           A variable that represents the list of directories that
                     [1mbmake [22mwill search for files.  The search list should be
                     updated using the target `[4m.PATH[24m' rather than the vari-
                     able.

     PWD             Alternate path to the current directory.  [1mbmake [22mnormally
                     sets `[4m.CURDIR[24m' to the canonical path given by getcwd(3).
                     However, if the environment variable `PWD' is set and
                     gives a path to the current directory, then [1mbmake [22msets
                     `[4m.CURDIR[24m' to the value of `PWD' instead.  This behavior
                     is disabled if `MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX' is set or `MAKEOBJDIR'
                     contains a variable transform.  `PWD' is set to the value
                     of `[4m.OBJDIR[24m' for all programs which [1mbmake [22mexecutes.

     .TARGETS        The list of targets explicitly specified on the command
                     line, if any.

     VPATH           Colon-separated (``:'') lists of directories that [1mbmake[0m
                     will search for files.  The variable is supported for
                     compatibility with old make programs only, use `[4m.PATH[24m'
                     instead.

   [1mVariable modifiers[0m
     Variable expansion may be modified to select or modify each word of the
     variable (where a ``word'' is white-space delimited sequence of charac-
     ters).  The general format of a variable expansion is as follows:

           ${variable[:modifier[:...]]}

     Each modifier begins with a colon, which may be escaped with a backslash
     (`\').

     A set of modifiers can be specified via a variable, as follows:

           modifier_variable=modifier[:...]
           ${variable:${modifier_variable}[:...]}

     In this case the first modifier in the modifier_variable does not start
     with a colon, since that must appear in the referencing variable.  If any
     of the modifiers in the modifier_variable contain a dollar sign (`$'),
     these must be doubled to avoid early expansion.

     The supported modifiers are:

     [1m:E   [22mReplaces each word in the variable with its suffix.

     [1m:H   [22mReplaces each word in the variable with everything but the last com-
          ponent.

     [1m:M[4m[22mpattern[0m
          Select only those words that match [4mpattern[24m.  The standard shell
          wildcard characters (`*', `?', and `[]') may be used.  The wildcard
          characters may be escaped with a backslash (`\').  As a consequence
          of the way values are split into words, matched, and then joined, a
          construct like
                ${VAR:M*}
          will normalize the inter-word spacing, removing all leading and
          trailing space, and converting multiple consecutive spaces to single
          spaces.

     [1m:N[4m[22mpattern[0m
          This is identical to `[1m:M[22m', but selects all words which do not match
          [4mpattern[24m.

     [1m:O   [22mOrder every word in variable alphabetically.  To sort words in
          reverse order use the `[1m:O:[-1..1][22m' combination of modifiers.

     [1m:Ox  [22mRandomize words in variable.  The results will be different each
          time you are referring to the modified variable; use the assignment
          with expansion (`[1m:=[22m') to prevent such behavior.  For example,

                LIST=                   uno due tre quattro
                RANDOM_LIST=            ${LIST:Ox}
                STATIC_RANDOM_LIST:=    ${LIST:Ox}

                all:
                        @echo "${RANDOM_LIST}"
                        @echo "${RANDOM_LIST}"
                        @echo "${STATIC_RANDOM_LIST}"
                        @echo "${STATIC_RANDOM_LIST}"
          may produce output similar to:

                quattro due tre uno
                tre due quattro uno
                due uno quattro tre
                due uno quattro tre

     [1m:Q   [22mQuotes every shell meta-character in the variable, so that it can be
          passed safely through recursive invocations of [1mbmake[22m.

     [1m:R   [22mReplaces each word in the variable with everything but its suffix.

     [1m:range[=count][0m
          The value is an integer sequence representing the words of the orig-
          inal value, or the supplied [4mcount[24m.

     [1m:gmtime[=utc][0m
          The value is a format string for strftime(3), using gmtime(3).  If a
          [4mutc[24m value is not provided or is 0, the current time is used.

     [1m:hash[0m
          Compute a 32-bit hash of the value and encode it as hex digits.

     [1m:localtime[=utc][0m
          The value is a format string for strftime(3), using localtime(3).
          If a [4mutc[24m value is not provided or is 0, the current time is used.

     [1m:tA  [22mAttempt to convert variable to an absolute path using realpath(3),
          if that fails, the value is unchanged.

     [1m:tl  [22mConverts variable to lower-case letters.

     [1m:ts[4m[22mc[0m
          Words in the variable are normally separated by a space on expan-
          sion.  This modifier sets the separator to the character [4mc[24m.  If [4mc[24m is
          omitted, then no separator is used.  The common escapes (including
          octal numeric codes), work as expected.

     [1m:tu  [22mConverts variable to upper-case letters.

     [1m:tW  [22mCauses the value to be treated as a single word (possibly containing
          embedded white space).  See also `[1m:[*][22m'.

     [1m:tw  [22mCauses the value to be treated as a sequence of words delimited by
          white space.  See also `[1m:[@][22m'.

     [1m:S[22m/[4mold_string[24m/[4mnew_string[24m/[[1m1gW[22m]
          Modify the first occurrence of [4mold_string[24m in the variable's value,
          replacing it with [4mnew_string[24m.  If a `g' is appended to the last
          slash of the pattern, all occurrences in each word are replaced.  If
          a `1' is appended to the last slash of the pattern, only the first
          word is affected.  If a `W' is appended to the last slash of the
          pattern, then the value is treated as a single word (possibly con-
          taining embedded white space).  If [4mold_string[24m begins with a caret
          (`^'), [4mold_string[24m is anchored at the beginning of each word.  If
          [4mold_string[24m ends with a dollar sign (`$'), it is anchored at the end
          of each word.  Inside [4mnew_string[24m, an ampersand (`&') is replaced by
          [4mold_string[24m (without any `^' or `$').  Any character may be used as a
          delimiter for the parts of the modifier string.  The anchoring,
          ampersand and delimiter characters may be escaped with a backslash
          (`\').

          Variable expansion occurs in the normal fashion inside both
          [4mold_string[24m and [4mnew_string[24m with the single exception that a backslash
          is used to prevent the expansion of a dollar sign (`$'), not a pre-
          ceding dollar sign as is usual.

     [1m:C[22m/[4mpattern[24m/[4mreplacement[24m/[[1m1gW[22m]
          The [1m:C [22mmodifier is just like the [1m:S [22mmodifier except that the old and
          new strings, instead of being simple strings, are an extended regu-
          lar expression (see regex(3)) string [4mpattern[24m and an ed(1)-style
          string [4mreplacement[24m.  Normally, the first occurrence of the pattern
          [4mpattern[24m in each word of the value is substituted with [4mreplacement[24m.
          The `1' modifier causes the substitution to apply to at most one
          word; the `g' modifier causes the substitution to apply to as many
          instances of the search pattern [4mpattern[24m as occur in the word or
          words it is found in; the `W' modifier causes the value to be
          treated as a single word (possibly containing embedded white space).
          Note that `1' and `g' are orthogonal; the former specifies whether
          multiple words are potentially affected, the latter whether multiple
          substitutions can potentially occur within each affected word.

          As for the [1m:S [22mmodifier, the [4mpattern[24m and [4mreplacement[24m are subjected to
          variable expansion before being parsed as regular expressions.

     [1m:T   [22mReplaces each word in the variable with its last component.

     [1m:u   [22mRemove adjacent duplicate words (like uniq(1)).

     [1m:?[4m[22mtrue_string[24m[1m:[4m[22mfalse_string[0m
          If the variable name (not its value), when parsed as a .if condi-
          tional expression, evaluates to true, return as its value the
          [4mtrue_string[24m, otherwise return the [4mfalse_string[24m.  Since the variable
          name is used as the expression, :? must be the first modifier after
          the variable name itself - which will, of course, usually contain
          variable expansions.  A common error is trying to use expressions
          like
                ${NUMBERS:M42:?match:no}
          which actually tests defined(NUMBERS), to determine is any words
          match "42" you need to use something like:
                ${"${NUMBERS:M42}" != "":?match:no}.

     [4m:old_string=new_string[0m
          This is the AT&T System V UNIX style variable substitution.  It must
          be the last modifier specified.  If [4mold_string[24m or [4mnew_string[24m do not
          contain the pattern matching character [4m%[24m then it is assumed that
          they are anchored at the end of each word, so only suffixes or
          entire words may be replaced.  Otherwise [4m%[24m is the substring of
          [4mold_string[24m to be replaced in [4mnew_string[24m.

          Variable expansion occurs in the normal fashion inside both
          [4mold_string[24m and [4mnew_string[24m with the single exception that a backslash
          is used to prevent the expansion of a dollar sign (`$'), not a pre-
          ceding dollar sign as is usual.

     [1m:@[4m[22mtemp[24m[1m@[4m[22mstring[24m[1m@[0m
          This is the loop expansion mechanism from the OSF Development Envi-
          ronment (ODE) make.  Unlike [1m.for [22mloops expansion occurs at the time
          of reference.  Assign [4mtemp[24m to each word in the variable and evaluate
          [4mstring[24m.  The ODE convention is that [4mtemp[24m should start and end with a
          period.  For example.
                ${LINKS:@.LINK.@${LN} ${TARGET} ${.LINK.}@}

          However a single character variable is often more readable:
                ${MAKE_PRINT_VAR_ON_ERROR:@v@$v='${$v}'${.newline}@}

     [1m:_[=var][0m
          Save the current variable value in `$_' or the named [4mvar[24m for later
          reference.  Example usage:

                M_cmpv.units = 1 1000 1000000
                M_cmpv = S,., ,g:_:range:@i@+ $${_:[-$$i]} \
                \* $${M_cmpv.units:[$$i]}@:S,^,expr 0 ,1:sh

                .if ${VERSION:${M_cmpv}} < ${3.1.12:L:${M_cmpv}}

          Here `$_' is used to save the result of the `:S' modifier which is
          later referenced using the index values from `:range'.

     [1m:U[4m[22mnewval[0m
          If the variable is undefined [4mnewval[24m is the value.  If the variable
          is defined, the existing value is returned.  This is another ODE
          make feature.  It is handy for setting per-target CFLAGS for
          instance:
                ${_${.TARGET:T}_CFLAGS:U${DEF_CFLAGS}}
          If a value is only required if the variable is undefined, use:
                ${VAR:D:Unewval}

     [1m:D[4m[22mnewval[0m
          If the variable is defined [4mnewval[24m is the value.

     [1m:L   [22mThe name of the variable is the value.

     [1m:P   [22mThe path of the node which has the same name as the variable is the
          value.  If no such node exists or its path is null, then the name of
          the variable is used.  In order for this modifier to work, the name
          (node) must at least have appeared on the rhs of a dependency.

     [1m:![4m[22mcmd[24m[1m![0m
          The output of running [4mcmd[24m is the value.

     [1m:sh  [22mIf the variable is non-empty it is run as a command and the output
          becomes the new value.

     [1m::=[4m[22mstr[0m
          The variable is assigned the value [4mstr[24m after substitution.  This
          modifier and its variations are useful in obscure situations such as
          wanting to set a variable when shell commands are being parsed.
          These assignment modifiers always expand to nothing, so if appearing
          in a rule line by themselves should be preceded with something to
          keep [1mbmake [22mhappy.

          The `[1m::[22m' helps avoid false matches with the AT&T System V UNIX style
          [1m:= [22mmodifier and since substitution always occurs the [1m::= [22mform is
          vaguely appropriate.

     [1m::?=[4m[22mstr[0m
          As for [1m::= [22mbut only if the variable does not already have a value.

     [1m::+=[4m[22mstr[0m
          Append [4mstr[24m to the variable.

     [1m::!=[4m[22mcmd[0m
          Assign the output of [4mcmd[24m to the variable.

     [1m:[[4m[22mrange[24m[1m][0m
          Selects one or more words from the value, or performs other opera-
          tions related to the way in which the value is divided into words.

          Ordinarily, a value is treated as a sequence of words delimited by
          white space.  Some modifiers suppress this behavior, causing a value
          to be treated as a single word (possibly containing embedded white
          space).  An empty value, or a value that consists entirely of white-
          space, is treated as a single word.  For the purposes of the `[1m:[][22m'
          modifier, the words are indexed both forwards using positive inte-
          gers (where index 1 represents the first word), and backwards using
          negative integers (where index -1 represents the last word).

          The [4mrange[24m is subjected to variable expansion, and the expanded
          result is then interpreted as follows:

          [4mindex[24m  Selects a single word from the value.

          [4mstart[24m[1m..[4m[22mend[0m
                 Selects all words from [4mstart[24m to [4mend[24m, inclusive.  For example,
                 `[1m:[2..-1][22m' selects all words from the second word to the last
                 word.  If [4mstart[24m is greater than [4mend[24m, then the words are out-
                 put in reverse order.  For example, `[1m:[-1..1][22m' selects all
                 the words from last to first.

          [1m*      [22mCauses subsequent modifiers to treat the value as a single
                 word (possibly containing embedded white space).  Analogous
                 to the effect of "$*" in Bourne shell.

          0      Means the same as `[1m:[*][22m'.

          [1m@      [22mCauses subsequent modifiers to treat the value as a sequence
                 of words delimited by white space.  Analogous to the effect
                 of "$@" in Bourne shell.

          [1m#      [22mReturns the number of words in the value.

[1mINCLUDE STATEMENTS, CONDITIONALS AND FOR LOOPS[0m
     Makefile inclusion, conditional structures and for loops  reminiscent of
     the C programming language are provided in [1mbmake[22m.  All such structures
     are identified by a line beginning with a single dot (`.') character.
     Files are included with either [1m.include [22m<[4mfile[24m> or [1m.include [22m"[4mfile[24m".  Vari-
     ables between the angle brackets or double quotes are expanded to form
     the file name.  If angle brackets are used, the included makefile is
     expected to be in the system makefile directory.  If double quotes are
     used, the including makefile's directory and any directories specified
     using the [1m-I [22moption are searched before the system makefile directory.
     For compatibility with other versions of [1mbmake [22m`include file ...' is also
     accepted.

     If the include statement is written as [1m.-include [22mor as [1m.sinclude [22mthen
     errors locating and/or opening include files are ignored.

     If the include statement is written as [1m.dinclude [22mnot only are errors
     locating and/or opening include files ignored, but stale dependencies
     within the included file will be ignored just like [4m.MAKE.DEPENDFILE[24m.

     Conditional expressions are also preceded by a single dot as the first
     character of a line.  The possible conditionals are as follows:

     [1m.error [4m[22mmessage[0m
             The message is printed along with the name of the makefile and
             line number, then [1mbmake [22mwill exit.

     [1m.export [4m[22mvariable[24m [4m...[0m
             Export the specified global variable.  If no variable list is
             provided, all globals are exported except for internal variables
             (those that start with `.').  This is not affected by the [1m-X[0m
             flag, so should be used with caution.  For compatibility with
             other [1mbmake [22mprograms `export variable=value' is also accepted.

             Appending a variable name to [4m.MAKE.EXPORTED[24m is equivalent to
             exporting a variable.

     [1m.export-env [4m[22mvariable[24m [4m...[0m
             The same as `.export', except that the variable is not appended
             to [4m.MAKE.EXPORTED[24m.  This allows exporting a value to the environ-
             ment which is different from that used by [1mbmake [22minternally.

     [1m.export-literal [4m[22mvariable[24m [4m...[0m
             The same as `.export-env', except that variables in the value are
             not expanded.

     [1m.info [4m[22mmessage[0m
             The message is printed along with the name of the makefile and
             line number.

     [1m.undef [4m[22mvariable[0m
             Un-define the specified global variable.  Only global variables
             may be un-defined.

     [1m.unexport [4m[22mvariable[24m [4m...[0m
             The opposite of `.export'.  The specified global [4mvariable[24m will be
             removed from [4m.MAKE.EXPORTED[24m.  If no variable list is provided,
             all globals are unexported, and [4m.MAKE.EXPORTED[24m deleted.

     [1m.unexport-env[0m
             Unexport all globals previously exported and clear the environ-
             ment inherited from the parent.  This operation will cause a mem-
             ory leak of the original environment, so should be used spar-
             ingly.  Testing for [4m.MAKE.LEVEL[24m being 0, would make sense.  Also
             note that any variables which originated in the parent environ-
             ment should be explicitly preserved if desired.  For example:

                   .if ${.MAKE.LEVEL} == 0
                   PATH := ${PATH}
                   .unexport-env
                   .export PATH
                   .endif

             Would result in an environment containing only `PATH', which is
             the minimal useful environment.  Actually `.MAKE.LEVEL' will also
             be pushed into the new environment.

     [1m.warning [4m[22mmessage[0m
             The message prefixed by `[4mwarning:[24m' is printed along with the name

     [1m.endif  [22mEnd the body of the conditional.

     The [4moperator[24m may be any one of the following:

     [1m||     [22mLogical OR.

     [1m&&     [22mLogical AND; of higher precedence than ``||''.

     As in C, [1mbmake [22mwill only evaluate a conditional as far as is necessary to
     determine its value.  Parentheses may be used to change the order of
     evaluation.  The boolean operator `[1m![22m' may be used to logically negate an
     entire conditional.  It is of higher precedence than `[1m&&[22m'.

     The value of [4mexpression[24m may be any of the following:

     [1mdefined  [22mTakes a variable name as an argument and evaluates to true if
              the variable has been defined.

     [1mmake     [22mTakes a target name as an argument and evaluates to true if the
              target was specified as part of [1mbmake[22m's command line or was
              declared the default target (either implicitly or explicitly,
              see [4m.MAIN[24m) before the line containing the conditional.

     [1mempty    [22mTakes a variable, with possible modifiers, and evaluates to true
              if the expansion of the variable would result in an empty
              string.

     [1mexists   [22mTakes a file name as an argument and evaluates to true if the
              file exists.  The file is searched for on the system search path
              (see [4m.PATH[24m).

     [1mtarget   [22mTakes a target name as an argument and evaluates to true if the
              target has been defined.

     [1mcommands[0m
              Takes a target name as an argument and evaluates to true if the
              target has been defined and has commands associated with it.

     [4mExpression[24m may also be an arithmetic or string comparison.  Variable
     expansion is performed on both sides of the comparison, after which the
     integral values are compared.  A value is interpreted as hexadecimal if
     it is preceded by 0x, otherwise it is decimal; octal numbers are not sup-
     ported.  The standard C relational operators are all supported.  If after
     variable expansion, either the left or right hand side of a `[1m==[22m' or `[1m!=[22m'
     operator is not an integral value, then string comparison is performed
     between the expanded variables.  If no relational operator is given, it
     is assumed that the expanded variable is being compared against 0 or an
     empty string in the case of a string comparison.

     When [1mbmake [22mis evaluating one of these conditional expressions, and it
     encounters a (white-space separated) word it doesn't recognize, either
     the ``make'' or ``defined'' expression is applied to it, depending on the
     form of the conditional.  If the form is `[1m.ifdef[22m', `[1m.ifndef[22m', or `[1m.if[22m'
     the ``defined'' expression is applied.  Similarly, if the form is
     `[1m.ifmake[22m' or `[1m.ifnmake[22m, [1mthe[22m' ``make'' expression is applied.

     If the conditional evaluates to true the parsing of the makefile contin-
     ues as before.  If it evaluates to false, the following lines are
     skipped.  In both cases this continues until a `[1m.else[22m' or `[1m.endif[22m' is
     found.

     For loops are typically used to apply a set of rules to a list of files.
     The syntax of a for loop is:

     [1m.for [4m[22mvariable[24m [[4mvariable[24m [4m...[24m] [1min [4m[22mexpression[0m
     <make-rules>
     [1m.endfor[0m

     After the for [1mexpression [22mis evaluated, it is split into words.  On each
     iteration of the loop, one word is taken and assigned to each [1mvariable[22m,
     in order, and these [1mvariables [22mare substituted into the [1mmake-rules [22minside
     the body of the for loop.  The number of words must come out even; that
     is, if there are three iteration variables, the number of words provided
     must be a multiple of three.

[1mCOMMENTS[0m
     Comments begin with a hash (`#') character, anywhere but in a shell com-
     mand line, and continue to the end of an unescaped new line.

               the most likely case.  In "meta" mode, the target is out-of-

     [1m.NOMETA   [22mDo not create a meta file for the target.  Meta files are also
               not created for [1m.PHONY[22m, [1m.MAKE[22m, or [1m.SPECIAL [22mtargets.

     [1m.NOMETA_CMP[0m
               Ignore differences in commands when deciding if target is out
               of date.  This is useful if the command contains a value which
               always changes.  If the number of commands change, though, the
               target will still be out of date.  The same effect applies to
               any command line that uses the variable [4m.OODATE[24m, which can be
               used for that purpose even when not otherwise needed or
               desired:


                     skip-compare-for-some:
                             @echo this will be compared

                             @echo this will also be compared

               The [1m:M [22mpattern suppresses any expansion of the unwanted vari-

     [1m.NOTMAIN  [22mNormally [1mbmake [22mselects the first target it encounters as the

     [1m.OPTIONAL[0m
               If a target is marked with this attribute and [1mbmake [22mcan't fig-
               ure out how to create it, it will ignore this fact and assume
               the file isn't needed or already exists.

     [1m.PHONY    [22mThe target does not correspond to an actual file; it is always
               considered to be out of date, and will not be created with the

               [1m.PHONY [22mtargets.

     [1m.PRECIOUS[0m
               When [1mbmake [22mis interrupted, it normally removes any partially
               made targets.  This source prevents the target from being
               removed.

     [1m.RECURSIVE[0m
               Synonym for [1m.MAKE[22m.

     [1m.SILENT   [22mDo not echo any of the commands associated with this target,
               exactly as if they all were preceded by an at sign (`@').

     [1m.USE      [22mTurn the target into [1mbmake[22m's version of a macro.  When the tar-
               get is used as a source for another target, the other target
               acquires the commands, sources, and attributes (except for
               [1m.USE[22m) of the source.  If the target already has commands, the
               [1m.USE [22mtarget's commands are appended to them.

     [1m.USEBEFORE[0m
               Exactly like [1m.USE[22m, but prepend the [1m.USEBEFORE [22mtarget commands
               to the target.

     [1m.WAIT     [22mIf [1m.WAIT [22mappears in a dependency line, the sources that precede
               it are made before the sources that succeed it in the line.
               Since the dependents of files are not made until the file
               itself could be made, this also stops the dependents being
               built unless they are needed for another branch of the depen-
               dency tree.  So given:

               x: a .WAIT b
                       echo x
               a:

               b1:
                       echo b1

               the output is always `a', `b1', `b', `x'.
               The ordering imposed by [1m.WAIT [22mis only relevant for parallel

              ate.  Only the shell script is used.  The [1m.IMPSRC [22mvariable of a
              target that inherits [1m.DEFAULT[22m's commands is set to the target's
              own name.

     [1m.DELETE_ON_ERROR[0m
              If this target is present in the makefile, it globally causes
              make to delete targets whose commands fail.  (By default, only
              targets whose commands are interrupted during execution are
              deleted.  This is the historical behavior.)  This setting can be
              used to help prevent half-finished or malformed targets from
              being left around and corrupting future rebuilds.

     [1m.END     [22mAny command lines attached to this target are executed after
              everything else is done.

     [1m.ERROR   [22mAny command lines attached to this target are executed when
              another target fails.  The [1m.ERROR_TARGET [22mvariable is set to the
              target that failed.  See also [1mMAKE_PRINT_VAR_ON_ERROR[22m.

     [1m.IGNORE  [22mMark each of the sources with the [1m.IGNORE [22mattribute.  If no
              sources are specified, this is the equivalent of specifying the
              [1m-i [22moption.

     [1m.INTERRUPT[0m
              If [1mbmake [22mis interrupted, the commands for this target will be
              executed.

     [1m.MAIN    [22mIf no target is specified when [1mbmake [22mis invoked, this target
              will be built.

     [1m.MAKEFLAGS[0m
              This target provides a way to specify flags for [1mbmake [22mwhen the
              makefile is used.  The flags are as if typed to the shell,
              though the [1m-f [22moption will have no effect.

     [1m.NOPATH  [22mApply the [1m.NOPATH [22mattribute to any specified sources.

     [1m.NOTPARALLEL[0m
              Disable parallel mode.

     [1m.NO_PARALLEL[0m
              Synonym for [1m.NOTPARALLEL[22m, for compatibility with other pmake
              variants.

     [1m.OBJDIR  [22mThe source is a new value for `[4m.OBJDIR[24m'.  If it exists, [1mbmake[0m
              will chdir(2) to it and update the value of `[4m.OBJDIR[24m'.

     [1m.ORDER   [22mThe named targets are made in sequence.  This ordering does not
              add targets to the list of targets to be made.  Since the depen-
              dents of a target do not get built until the target itself could
              be built, unless `a' is built by another part of the dependency
              graph, the following is a dependency loop:

              .ORDER: b a
              b: a

              The ordering imposed by [1m.ORDER [22mis only relevant for parallel
              makes.

     [1m.PATH    [22mThe sources are directories which are to be searched for files
              not found in the current directory.  If no sources are speci-
              fied, any previously specified directories are deleted.  If the
              source is the special [1m.DOTLAST [22mtarget, then the current working
              directory is searched last.

     [1m.PATH.[4m[22msuffix[0m
              Like [1m.PATH [22mbut applies only to files with a particular suffix.
              The suffix must have been previously declared with [1m.SUFFIXES[22m.

     [1m.PHONY   [22mApply the [1m.PHONY [22mattribute to any specified sources.

     [1m.PRECIOUS[0m
              Apply the [1m.PRECIOUS [22mattribute to any specified sources.  If no
              sources are specified, the [1m.PRECIOUS [22mattribute is applied to
              every target in the file.

     [1m.SHELL   [22mSets the shell that [1mbmake [22mwill use to execute commands.  The
              sources are a set of [4mfield=value[24m pairs.

              [4mname[24m        This is the minimal specification, used to select
                          one of the built-in shell specs; [4msh[24m, [4mksh[24m, and [4mcsh[24m.

              [4mpath[24m        Specifies the path to the shell.

              [4mhasErrCtl[24m   Indicates whether the shell supports exit on error.

              [4mcheck[24m       The command to turn on error checking.

              [4mignore[24m      The command to disable error checking.

              [4mecho[24m        The command to turn on echoing of commands executed.

              [4mquiet[24m       The command to turn off echoing of commands exe-
                          cuted.

              [4mfilter[24m      The output to filter after issuing the [4mquiet[24m com-
                          mand.  It is typically identical to [4mquiet[24m.

              [4merrFlag[24m     The flag to pass the shell to enable error checking.

              [4mechoFlag[24m    The flag to pass the shell to enable command echo-
                          ing.

              [4mnewline[24m     The string literal to pass the shell that results in
                          a single newline character when used outside of any
                          quoting characters.
              Example:

              .SHELL: name=ksh path=/bin/ksh hasErrCtl=true \
                      check="set -e" ignore="set +e" \
                      echo="set -v" quiet="set +v" filter="set +v" \
                      echoFlag=v errFlag=e newline="'\n'"

     [1m.SILENT  [22mApply the [1m.SILENT [22mattribute to any specified sources.  If no
              sources are specified, the [1m.SILENT [22mattribute is applied to every
              command in the file.

     [1m.STALE   [22mThis target gets run when a dependency file contains stale
              entries, having [4m.ALLSRC[24m set to the name of that dependency file.

     [1m.SUFFIXES[0m
              Each source specifies a suffix to [1mbmake[22m.  If no sources are
              specified, any previously specified suffixes are deleted.  It
              allows the creation of suffix-transformation rules.

              Example:

              .SUFFIXES: .o
              .c.o:
                      cc -o ${.TARGET} -c ${.IMPSRC}

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
     [1mbmake [22muses the following environment variables, if they exist: MACHINE,
     MACHINE_ARCH, MAKE, MAKEFLAGS, MAKEOBJDIR, MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX, MAKESYSPATH,
     PWD, and TMPDIR.

     MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX and MAKEOBJDIR may only be set in the environment or on
     the command line to [1mbmake [22mand not as makefile variables; see the descrip-
     tion of `[4m.OBJDIR[24m' for more details.

[1mFILES[0m

     Makefile       list of dependencies

[1mCOMPATIBILITY[0m
     The basic make syntax is compatible between different versions of make;
     however the special variables, variable modifiers and conditionals are
     not.

   [1mOlder versions[0m
     An incomplete list of changes in older versions of [1mbmake[22m:

     The way that .for loop variables are substituted changed after NetBSD 5.0
     so that they still appear to be variable expansions.  In particular this
     stops them being treated as syntax, and removes some obscure problems
     using them in .if statements.

     The way that parallel makes are scheduled changed in NetBSD 4.0 so that
     .ORDER and .WAIT apply recursively to the dependent nodes.  The algo-
     rithms used may change again in the future.

   [1mOther make dialects[0m
     Other make dialects (GNU make, SVR4 make, POSIX make, etc.) do not sup-
     port most of the features of [1mbmake [22mas described in this manual.  Most
     notably:

           [1m+o   [22mThe [1m.WAIT [22mand [1m.ORDER [22mdeclarations and most functionality per-
               taining to parallelization.  (GNU make supports parallelization
               but lacks these features needed to control it effectively.)

           [1m+o   [22mDirectives, including for loops and conditionals and most of
               the forms of include files.  (GNU make has its own incompatible
               and less powerful syntax for conditionals.)

           [1m+o   [22mAll built-in variables that begin with a dot.

           [1m+o   [22mMost of the special sources and targets that begin with a dot,
               with the notable exception of [1m.PHONY[22m, [1m.PRECIOUS[22m, and [1m.SUFFIXES[22m.

           [1m+o   [22mVariable modifiers, except for the
                     :old=new
               string substitution, which does not portably support globbing
               with `%' and historically only works on declared suffixes.

           [1m+o   [22mThe [1m$> [22mvariable even in its short form; most makes support this
               functionality but its name varies.

     Some features are somewhat more portable, such as assignment with [1m+=[22m, [1m?=[22m,
     and [1m!=[22m.  The [1m.PATH [22mfunctionality is based on an older feature [1mVPATH [22mfound
     in GNU make and many versions of SVR4 make; however, historically its
     behavior is too ill-defined (and too buggy) to rely upon.

     The [1m$@ [22mand [1m$< [22mvariables are more or less universally portable, as is the
     [1m$(MAKE) [22mvariable.  Basic use of suffix rules (for files only in the cur-
     rent directory, not trying to chain transformations together, etc.) is
     also reasonably portable.

[1mSEE ALSO[0m
     mkdep(1)

[1mHISTORY[0m
     [1mbmake [22mis derived from NetBSD make(1).  It uses autoconf to facilitate
     portability to other platforms.

     A make command appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.  This make implementation
     is based on Adam De Boor's pmake program which was written for Sprite at
     Berkeley.  It was designed to be a parallel distributed make running jobs
     on different machines using a daemon called ``customs''.

     Historically the target/dependency ``FRC'' has been used to FoRCe
     rebuilding (since the target/dependency does not exist... unless someone
     creates an ``FRC'' file).

[1mBUGS[0m
     The make syntax is difficult to parse without actually acting of the
     data.  For instance finding the end of a variable use should involve
     scanning each the modifiers using the correct terminator for each field.
     In many places make just counts {} and () in order to find the end of a
     variable expansion.

     There is no way of escaping a space character in a filename.
