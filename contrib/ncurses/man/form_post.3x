.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBpost_form\fR displays a form to its associated subwindow.  To
trigger physical display of the subwindow, use \fBrefresh\fR or some equivalent
\fBcurses\fR routine (the implicit \fBdoupdate\fR triggered by an \fBcurses\fR
input request will do).

.SH RETURN VALUE
These routines return one of the following:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_STATE
Routine was called from an initialization or termination function.
.TP 5
.B E_NOT_POSTED

.TP 5
.B E_NOT_CONNECTED

.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBform\fR(3X).
.SH NOTES

Version 7 or BSD versions.
