# authoritatively.  zonefile: reads from file (and writes to it if you also

# 1. the keys/certs cannot be produced by unbound. You can use dnscrypt-wrapper

# 2. dnscrypt channel attaches to an interface. you MUST set interfaces to
#   listen on `dnscrypt-port` with the follo0wing snippet:
# server:
#     interface: 0.0.0.0@443
#     interface: ::0@443

# Finally, `dnscrypt` config has its own section.

# CacheDB
# Enable external backend DB as auxiliary cache.  Specify the backend name
# (default is "testframe", which has no use other than for debugging and
