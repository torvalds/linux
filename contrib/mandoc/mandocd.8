.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mandocd
.Nd server process to format manual pages in batch mode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mandocd
.Op Fl I Cm os Ns = Ns Ar name
.Op Fl T Ar output
.Ar socket_fd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility formats many manual pages without requiring
.Xr fork 2
and
.Xr exec 3
overhead in between.
It does not require listing all the manuals to be formatted on the
command line, and it supports writing each formatted manual to its
own file descriptor.
.Pp
This server requires that a connected UNIX domain
.Xr socket 2
is already present at
.Xr exec 3
time.
Consequently, it cannot be started from the
.Xr sh 1
command line because the shell cannot supply such a socket.
Typically, the socket is created by the parent process using
.Xr socketpair 2
before calling
.Xr fork 2
and
.Xr exec 3
on
.Nm .
The parent process will pass the file descriptor number as an argument to
.Xr exec 3 ,
formatted as a decimal ASCII-encoded integer.
See
.Xr catman 8
for a typical implementation of a parent process.
.Pp
.Nm
loops reading one-byte messages with
.Xr recvmsg 2
from the file descriptor number
.Ar socket_fd .
It ignores the byte read and only uses the out-of-band auxiliary
.Vt struct cmsghdr
control data, typically supplied by the calling process using
.Xr CMSG_FIRSTHDR 3 .
The parent process is expected to pass three file descriptors
with each dummy byte.
The first one is used for
.Xr mdoc 7
or
.Xr man 7
input, the second one for formatted output, and the third one
for error output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl I Cm os Ns = Ns Ar name
Override the default operating system
.Ar name
for the
.Xr mdoc 7
.Ic \&Os
and for the
.Xr man 7
.Ic TH
macro.
.It Fl T Ar output
Output format.
The
.Ar output
argument can be
.Cm ascii ,
.Cm utf8 ,
or
.Cm html ;
see
.Xr mandoc 1 .
In
.Cm html
output mode, the
.Cm fragment
output option is implied.
Other output options are not supported.
.El
.Pp
After exhausting one input file descriptor, all three file descriptors
are closed before reading the next dummy byte and control message.
.Pp
When a zero-byte message is read, when the
.Ar socket_fd
is closed by the parent process,
or when an error occurs,
.Nm
exits.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Pp
A zero-byte message or a closed
.Ar socket_fd
is considered success.
Possible errors include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
missing, invalid, or excessive
.Xr exec 3
arguments
.It
.Xr recvmsg 2
failure, for example due to
.Er EMSGSIZE
.It
missing or unexpected control data, in particular a
.Fa cmsg_level
in the
.Vt struct cmsghdr
that differs from
.Dv SOL_SOCKET ,
a
.Fa cmsg_type
that differs from
.Dv SCM_RIGHTS ,
or a
.Fa cmsg_len
that is not three times the size of an
.Vt int
.It
invalid file descriptors passed in the
.Xr CMSG_DATA 3
.It
resource exhaustion, in particular
.Xr dup 2
or
.Xr malloc 3
failure
.El
.Pp
Except for memory exhaustion and similar system-level failures,
parsing and formatting errors do not cause
.Nm
to return an error exit status.
Even after severe parsing errors,
.Nm
will simply accept and process the next input file descriptor.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in version 1.14.1 or the
.Sy mandoc
toolkit.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The concept was designed and implemented by
.An Michael Stapelberg Aq Mt stapelberg@debian.org .
The
.Xr mandoc 3
glue needed to make it a stand-alone process was added by
.An Ingo Schwarze Aq Mt schwarze@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
If the parsed manual pages contain
.Xr roff 7
.Pf . Ic so
requests,
.Nm
needs to be started with the current working directory set to the
root of the manual page tree.
Avoid starting it in directories that contain secret files in any
subdirectories, in particular in the user starting it has read
access to these secret files.
