Many issues are annotated for difficulty as follows:

 - loc = locality of the issue
    *    single file issue, affects file only, or very few
    **   single module issue, affects several files of one module
    ***  cross-module issue, significantly impacts multiple modules
         and may require substantial changes to internal interfaces
 - exist = difficulty of the existing code in this area
    *    affected code is straightforward and easy to read and change
    **   affected code is somewhat complex, but once you understand
         the design, not particularly difficult to understand
    ***  affected code uses a special, exceptionally tricky design
 - algo = difficulty of the new algorithm to be written
    *    the required logic and code is straightforward
    **   the required logic is somewhat complex and needs a careful design
    ***  the required logic is exceptionally tricky,
         maybe an approach to solve that is not even known yet
 - size = the amount of code to be written or changed
    *    a small number of lines (at most 100, usually much less)
    **   a considerable amount of code (several dozen to a few hundred)
    ***  a large amount of code (many hundreds, maybe thousands)
 - imp = importance of the issue
    *    mostly for completeness
    **   would be nice to have
    ***  issue causes considerable inconvenience

Obviously, as the issues have not been solved yet, these annotations
are mere guesses, and some may be wrong.

--- missing roff features ----------------------------------------------

- .nop prints its arguments as text,
  see groff(7) for an example

- .ft CB selects constant-width bold font
  see groff_out(7) for examples

- \*(.T prints the device being used,
  see groff_char(7) for an example

- \[charNN], \[charNNN] prints a single-byte codepoint
  see groff_char(7) for examples

- .ad (adjust margins)
  .ad l -- adjust left margin only (flush left)
  .ad r -- adjust right margin only (flush right)
  .ad c -- center text on line
  .ad b -- adjust both margins (alias: .ad n)
  .na   -- temporarily disable adjustment without changing the mode
  .ad   -- re-enable adjustment without changing the mode
  Adjustment mode is ignored while in no-fill mode (.nf).

  loc **  exist ***  algo ***  size *  imp ***

- \\ in high-level macro arguments
  Currently, \\ is expanded in two situations:
  1) macro and string definition (roff.c setstrn())
  2) macro argument parsing (mandoc.c mandoc_getarg())
  For user defined macros, the second happens in time because of ROFF_REPARSE.
  But for standard high-level macros, it only happens after entering the
  high level parsers, which is too late because the code doesn't get
  back to roff.c roff_res() from that point.  Because this requires
  distinguishing requests, user-defined macros and standard macros
  on the roff_res() level, it is hard to solve without the parser reorg.

  loc *  exist ***  algo ***  size **  imp **

- .Bd -centered implies -filled, not -unfilled, which is not
  easy to implement; it requires code similar to .ce, which
  we don't have either.
  Besides, groff has bug causing text right *before* .Bd -centered
  to be centered as well.
  loc ***  exist ***  algo **  size **  imp **  (parser reorg would help)

- .Bd -filled should not be the same as .Bd -ragged, but align both
  the left and right margin.  In groff, it is implemented in terms
  of .ad b, which we don't have either.  Found in cksum(1).

  flags defined for struct mdoc_macro

- In .Bl -column .It, the end of the line probably has to be regarded
  as an implicit .Ta, if there could be one, see the following mildly
  ugly code from login.conf(5):

  loc *  exist ***  algo **  size *  imp **

- inside `.Bl -column' phrases, punctuation is handled like normal
  text, e.g. `.Bl -column .It Fl x . Ta ...' should give "-x -."

- inside `.Bl -column' phrases, TERMP_IGNDELIM handling by `Pf'
  is not safe, e.g. `.Bl -column .It Pf a b .' gives "ab."
  but should give "ab ."

- prohibit `Nm' from having non-text HEAD children
  (e.g., NetBSD mDNSShared/dns-sd.1)
  (mdoc_html.c and mdoc_term.c `Nm' handlers can be slightly simplified)

- support translated section names
  e.g. x11/scrotwm scrotwm_es.1:21:2: error: NAME section must be first
  that one uses NOMBRE because it is spanish...
  deraadt tends to think that section-dependent macro behaviour
  is a bad idea in the first place, so this may be irrelevant
  loc **  exist **  algo **  size *  imp **

- When there is free text in the SYNOPSIS and that free text contains
  the .Nm macro, groff somehow understands to treat the .Nm as an in-line
  macro, while mandoc treats it as a block macro and breaks the line.
  No idea how the logic for distinguishing in-line and block instances
  should be, needs investigation.

--- missing man features -----------------------------------------------

- .SY and .YS,
  used by many groff manual pages

- preserve punctuation following .ME,
  see ditroff(7) for an example

- .TQ tagged paragraph continuation,
  see groff_diff(7) for examples

- groff_www(7) .MTO and .URL
  These macros were used by the GNU grep(1) man page.
  The groff_www(7) manual page itself uses them, too.
  We should probably *not* add them to mandoc.
  Just mentioning this here to keep track of the abuse.

- .%T can have trailing punctuation.  Currently, it puts the trailing
  punctuation into a trailing MDOC_TEXT element inside its own scope.
  That element should rather be outside its scope, such that the
  punctuation does not get underlines.  This is not trivial to
  implement because .%T then needs some features of in_line_eoln() -
  slurp all arguments into one single text element - and one feature
  of in_line() - put trailing punctuation out of scope.
  Found in mount_nfs(8) and exports(5), search for "Appendix".

- mark macros as: page structure domain, manual domain, general text domain
  is this useful?

- mention /usr/share/misc/mdoc.template in mdoc(7)?

- Is all the content from http://www.std.com/obi/BSD/doc/usd/28.tbl/tbl
  covered in tbl(7)?

- POSIX says in the documentation of sysconf(3) that PATH_MAX
  is allowed to be so large that it is a bad idea to use it
  for sizing static buffers.  So use dynamic buffers throughout.
  See the file test-PATH_MAX.c for details.

- We use the input line number at several places to distinguish
  same-line from different-line input.  That plainly doesn't work
  with user-defined macros, leading to random breakage.

- Is it possible to further simplify ENDBODY_SPACE?

- .Cd # arch1, arch2 in section 4 pages:
  find better way to indicate multiple architectures, maybe:
  allow .Dt vgafb 4 "macppc sparc64"
  already shown as "Device Drivers Manual (macppc sparc64)"
  for apropos, make that "vgafb(4) - macppc # sparc64" instead of "- all"
  groff can be made to show multiple arches, too, but it is
  tedious to do the string parsing in roff code...

  Do we need to fix existing manuals?
  Do we need to fix the definition of the mdoc(7) language?
