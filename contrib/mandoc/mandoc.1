.Dt MANDOC 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mandoc
.Nd format manual pages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mandoc
.Op Fl ac
.Op Fl I Cm os Ns = Ns Ar name
.Op Fl K Ar encoding
.Op Fl mdoc | man
.Op Fl O Ar options
.Op Fl T Ar output
.Op Fl W Ar level
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility formats manual pages for display.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
reads
.Xr mdoc 7
or
.Xr man 7
text from stdin and produces
.Fl T Cm locale
output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
If the standard output is a terminal device and
.Fl c
is not specified, use
.Xr more 1
to paginate the output, just like
.Xr man 1
would.
.It Fl c
Copy the formatted manual pages to the standard output without using
.Xr more 1
to paginate them.
This is the default.
It can be specified to override
.Fl a .
.It Fl I Cm os Ns = Ns Ar name
Override the default operating system
.Ar name
for the
.Xr mdoc 7
.Ic \&Os
and for the
.Xr man 7
.Ic \&TH
macro.
.It Fl K Ar encoding
Specify the input encoding.
The supported
.Ar encoding
arguments are
.Cm us-ascii ,
.Cm iso-8859-1 ,
and
.Cm utf-8 .
If not specified, autodetection uses the first match in the following
list:
.Bl -enum
.It
If the first three bytes of the input file are the UTF-8 byte order
mark (BOM, 0xefbbbf), input is interpreted as
.Cm utf-8 .
.It
If the first or second line of the input file matches the
.Sy emacs
mode line format
.Pp
.D1 .\e" -*- Oo ...; Oc coding: Ar encoding ; No -*-
.Pp
then input is interpreted according to
.Ar encoding .
.It
If the first non-ASCII byte in the file introduces a valid UTF-8
sequence, input is interpreted as
.Cm utf-8 .
.It
Otherwise, input is interpreted as
.Cm iso-8859-1 .
.El
.It Fl mdoc | man
With
.Fl mdoc ,
all input files are interpreted as
.Xr mdoc 7 .
With
.Fl man ,
all input files are interpreted as
.Xr man 7 .
By default, the input language is automatically detected for each file:
if the first macro is
.Ic \&Dd
or
.Ic \&Dt ,
the
.Xr mdoc 7
parser is used; otherwise, the
.Xr man 7
parser is used.
With other arguments,
.Fl m
is silently ignored.
.It Fl O Ar options
Comma-separated output options.
See the descriptions of the individual output formats for supported
.Ar options .
.It Fl T Ar output
Select the output format.
Supported values for the
.Ar output
argument are
.Cm ascii ,
.Cm html ,
the default of
.Cm locale ,
.Cm man ,
.Cm markdown ,
.Cm pdf ,
.Cm ps ,
.Cm tree ,
and
.Cm utf8 .
.Pp
The special
.Fl T Cm lint
mode only parses the input and produces no output.
It implies
.Fl W Cm all
and redirects parser messages, which usually appear on standard
error output, to standard output.
.It Fl W Ar level
Specify the minimum message
.Ar level
to be reported on the standard error output and to affect the exit status.
The
.Ar level
can be
.Cm base ,
.Cm style ,
.Cm warning ,
.Cm error ,
or
.Cm unsupp .
The
.Cm base
level automatically derives the operating system from the contents of the
.Ic \&Os
macro, from the
.Fl Ios
command line option, or from the
.Xr uname 3
return value.
The levels
.Cm openbsd
and
.Cm netbsd
are variants of
.Cm base
that bypass autodetection and request validation of base system
conventions for a particular operating system.
The level
.Cm all
is an alias for
.Cm base .
By default,
.Nm
is silent.
See
.Sx EXIT STATUS
and
.Sx DIAGNOSTICS
for details.
.Pp
The special option
.Fl W Cm stop
tells
.Nm
to exit after parsing a file that causes warnings or errors of at least
the requested level.
No formatted output will be produced from that file.
If both a
.Ar level
and
.Cm stop
are requested, they can be joined with a comma, for example
.Fl W Cm error , Ns Cm stop .
.It Ar file
Read from the given input file.
If multiple files are specified, they are processed in the given order.
If unspecified,
.Nm
reads from standard input.
.El
.Pp
The options
.Fl fhklw
are also supported and are documented in man(1).
In
.Fl f
and
.Fl k
mode,
.Nm
also supports the options
.Fl CMmOSs
described in the
.Xr apropos 1
manual.
The options
.Fl fkl
are mutually exclusive and override each other.
.Ss ASCII Output
Use
.Fl T Cm ascii
to force text output in 7-bit ASCII character encoding documented in the
.Xr ascii 7
manual page, ignoring the
.Xr locale 1
set in the environment.
.Pp
Font styles are applied by using back-spaced encoding such that an
underlined character
.Sq c
is rendered as
.Sq _ Ns \e[bs] Ns c ,
where
.Sq \e[bs]
is the back-space character number 8.
Emboldened characters are rendered as
.Sq c Ns \e[bs] Ns c .
.Pp
The special characters documented in
.Xr mandoc_char 7
are rendered best-effort in an ASCII equivalent.
.Pp
The following
.Fl O
arguments are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm indent Ns = Ns Ar indent
The left margin for normal text is set to
.Ar indent
blank characters instead of the default of five for
.Xr mdoc 7
and seven for
.Xr man 7 .
Increasing this is not recommended; it may result in degraded formatting,
for example overfull lines or ugly line breaks.
When output is to a pager on a terminal that is less than 66 columns
wide, the default is reduced to three columns.
.It Cm mdoc
Format
.Xr man 7
input files in
.Xr mdoc 7
output style.
Specifically, this suppresses the two additional blank lines near the
top and the bottom of each page, and it implies
.Fl O Cm indent Ns =5 .
One useful application is for checking that
.Fl T Cm man
output formats in the same way as the
.Xr mdoc 7
source it was generated from.
.It Cm width Ns = Ns Ar width
The output width is set to
.Ar width
instead of the default of 78.
When output is to a pager on a terminal that is less than 79 columns
wide, the default is reduced to one less than the terminal width.
In any case, lines that are output in literal mode are never wrapped
and may exceed the output width.
.El
.Ss HTML Output
Output produced by
.Fl T Cm html
conforms to HTML5 using optional self-closing tags.
Default styles use only CSS1.
Equations rendered from
.Xr eqn 7
blocks use MathML.
.Pp
The
.Pa mandoc.css
file documents style-sheet classes available for customising output.
If a style-sheet is not specified with
.Fl O Cm style ,
.Fl T Cm html
defaults to simple output (via an embedded style-sheet)
readable in any graphical or text-based web
browser.
.Pp
Non-ASCII characters are rendered
as hexadecimal Unicode character references.
.Pp
The following
.Fl O
arguments are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm fragment
Omit the <!DOCTYPE> declaration and the <html>, <head>, and <body>
elements and only emit the subtree below the <body> element.
The
.Cm style
argument will be ignored.
This is useful when embedding manual content within existing documents.
.It Cm includes Ns = Ns Ar fmt
The string
.Ar fmt ,
for example,
.Ar ../src/%I.html ,
is used as a template for linked header files (usually via the
.Ic \&In
macro).
Instances of
.Sq \&%I
are replaced with the include filename.
The default is not to present a
hyperlink.
.It Cm man Ns = Ns Ar fmt
The string
.Ar fmt ,
for example,
.Ar ../html%S/%N.%S.html ,
is used as a template for linked manuals (usually via the
.Ic \&Xr
macro).
Instances of
.Sq \&%N
and
.Sq %S
are replaced with the linked manual's name and section, respectively.
If no section is included, section 1 is assumed.
The default is not to
present a hyperlink.
.It Cm style Ns = Ns Ar style.css
The file
.Ar style.css
is used for an external style-sheet.
This must be a valid absolute or
relative URI.
.El
.Ss Locale Output
By default,
.Nm
automatically selects UTF-8 or ASCII output according to the current
.Xr locale 1 .
If any of the environment variables
.Ev LC_ALL ,
.Ev LC_CTYPE ,
or
.Ev LANG
are set and the first one that is set
selects the UTF-8 character encoding, it produces
.Sx UTF-8 Output ;
otherwise, it falls back to
.Sx ASCII Output .
This output mode can also be selected explicitly with
.Fl T Cm locale .
.Ss Man Output
Use
.Fl T Cm man
to translate
.Xr mdoc 7
input into
.Xr man 7
output format.
This is useful for distributing manual sources to legacy systems
lacking
.Xr mdoc 7
formatters.
.Pp
If the input format of a file is
.Xr man 7 ,
the input is copied to the output, expanding any
.Xr roff 7
.Ic so
requests.
The parser is also run, and as usual, the
.Fl W
level controls which
.Sx DIAGNOSTICS
are displayed before copying the input to the output.
.Ss Markdown Output
Use
.Fl T Cm markdown
to translate
.Xr mdoc 7
input to the markdown format conforming to
.Lk http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text\
 "John Gruber's 2004 specification" .
The output also almost conforms to the
.Lk http://commonmark.org/ CommonMark
specification.
.Pp
The character set used for the markdown output is ASCII.
Non-ASCII characters are encoded as HTML entities.
Since that is not possible in literal font contexts, because these
are rendered as code spans and code blocks in the markdown output,
non-ASCII characters are transliterated to ASCII approximations in
these contexts.
.Pp
Markdown is a very weak markup language, so all semantic markup is
lost, and even part of the presentational markup may be lost.
Do not use this as an intermediate step in converting to HTML;
instead, use
.Fl T Cm html
directly.
.Pp
The
.Xr man 7 ,
.Xr tbl 7 ,
and
.Xr eqn 7
input languages are not supported by
.Fl T Cm markdown
output mode.
.Ss PDF Output
PDF-1.1 output may be generated by
.Fl T Cm pdf .
See
.Sx PostScript Output
for
.Fl O
arguments and defaults.
.Ss PostScript Output
PostScript
.Qq Adobe-3.0
Level-2 pages may be generated by
.Fl T Cm ps .
Output pages default to letter sized and are rendered in the Times font
family, 11-point.
Margins are calculated as 1/9 the page length and width.
Line-height is 1.4m.
.Pp
Special characters are rendered as in
.Sx ASCII Output .
.Pp
The following
.Fl O
arguments are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm paper Ns = Ns Ar name
The paper size
.Ar name
may be one of
.Ar a3 ,
.Ar a4 ,
.Ar a5 ,
.Ar legal ,
or
.Ar letter .
You may also manually specify dimensions as
.Ar NNxNN ,
width by height in millimetres.
If an unknown value is encountered,
.Ar letter
is used.
.El
.Ss UTF-8 Output
Use
.Fl T Cm utf8
to force text output in UTF-8 multi-byte character encoding,
ignoring the
.Xr locale 1
settings in the environment.
See
.Sx ASCII Output
regarding font styles and
.Fl O
arguments.
.Pp
On operating systems lacking locale or wide character support, and
on those where the internal character representation is not UCS-4,
.Nm
always falls back to
.Sx ASCII Output .
.Ss Syntax tree output
Use
.Fl T Cm tree
to show a human readable representation of the syntax tree.
It is useful for debugging the source code of manual pages.
The exact format is subject to change, so don't write parsers for it.
.Pp
The first paragraph shows meta data found in the
.Xr mdoc 7
prologue, on the
.Xr man 7
.Ic \&TH
line, or the fallbacks used.
.Pp
In the tree dump, each output line shows one syntax tree node.
Child nodes are indented with respect to their parent node.
The columns are:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
For macro nodes, the macro name; for text and
.Xr tbl 7
nodes, the content.
There is a special format for
.Xr eqn 7
nodes.
.It
Node type (text, elem, block, head, body, body-end, tail, tbl, eqn).
.It
Flags:
.Bl -dash -compact
.It
An opening parenthesis if the node is an opening delimiter.
.It
An asterisk if the node starts a new input line.
.It
The input line number (starting at one).
.It
A colon.
.It
The input column number (starting at one).
.It
A closing parenthesis if the node is a closing delimiter.
.It
A full stop if the node ends a sentence.
.It
BROKEN if the node is a block broken by another block.
.It
NOSRC if the node is not in the input file,
but automatically generated from macros.
.It
NOPRT if the node is not supposed to generate output
for any output format.
.El
.El
.Pp
The following
.Fl O
argument is accepted:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm noval
Skip validation and show the unvalidated syntax tree.
This can help to find out whether a given behaviour is caused by
the parser or by the validator.
Meta data is not available in this case.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width MANPAGER
.It Ev LC_CTYPE
The character encoding
.Xr locale 1 .
When
.Sx Locale Output
is selected, it decides whether to use ASCII or UTF-8 output format.
It never affects the interpretation of input files.
.It Ev MANPAGER
Any non-empty value of the environment variable
.Ev MANPAGER
is used instead of the standard pagination program,
.Xr more 1 ;
see
.Xr man 1
for details.
Only used if
.Fl a
or
.Fl l
is specified.
.It Ev PAGER
Specifies the pagination program to use when
.Ev MANPAGER
is not defined.
If neither PAGER nor MANPAGER is defined,
.Xr more 1
.Fl s
is used.
Only used if
.Fl a
or
.Fl l
is specified.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values, controlled by the message
.Ar level
associated with the
.Fl W
option:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It 0
No base system convention violations, style suggestions, warnings,
or errors occurred, or those that did were ignored because they
were lower than the requested
.Ar level .
.It 1
At least one base system convention violation or style suggestion
occurred, but no warning or error, and
.Fl W Cm base
or
.Fl W Cm style
was specified.
.It 2
At least one warning occurred, but no error, and
.Fl W Cm warning
or a lower
.Ar level
was requested.
.It 3
At least one parsing error occurred,
but no unsupported feature was encountered, and
.Fl W Cm error
or a lower
.Ar level
was requested.
.It 4
At least one unsupported feature was encountered, and
.Fl W Cm unsupp
or a lower
.Ar level
was requested.
.It 5
Invalid command line arguments were specified.
No input files have been read.
.It 6
An operating system error occurred, for example exhaustion
of memory, file descriptors, or process table entries.
Such errors cause
.Nm
to exit at once, possibly in the middle of parsing or formatting a file.
.El
.Pp
Note that selecting
.Fl T Cm lint
output mode implies
.Fl W Cm all .
.Sh EXAMPLES
To page manuals to the terminal:
.Pp
.Dl $ mandoc -l mandoc.1 man.1 apropos.1 makewhatis.8
.Pp
To produce HTML manuals with
.Pa mandoc.css
as the style-sheet:
.Pp
.Dl $ mandoc \-T html -O style=mandoc.css mdoc.7 \*(Gt mdoc.7.html
.Pp
To check over a large set of manuals:
.Pp
.Dl $ mandoc \-T lint \(gafind /usr/src -name \e*\e.[1-9]\(ga
.Pp
To produce a series of PostScript manuals for A4 paper:
.Pp
.Dl $ mandoc \-T ps \-O paper=a4 mdoc.7 man.7 \*(Gt manuals.ps
.Pp
Convert a modern
.Xr mdoc 7
manual to the older
.Xr man 7
format, for use on systems lacking an
.Xr mdoc 7
parser:
.Pp
.Dl $ mandoc \-T man foo.mdoc \*(Gt foo.man
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Messages displayed by
.Nm
follow this format:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Nm :
.Ar file : Ns Ar line : Ns Ar column : level : message : macro args
.Pq Ar os
.Ed
.Pp
Line and column numbers start at 1.
Both are omitted for messages referring to an input file as a whole.
Macro names and arguments are omitted where meaningless.
The
.Ar os
operating system specifier is omitted for messages that are relevant
for all operating systems.
Fatal messages about invalid command line arguments
or operating system errors, for example when memory is exhausted,
may also omit the
.Ar file
and
.Ar level
fields.
.Pp
Message levels have the following meanings:
.Bl -tag -width "warning"
.It Cm unsupp
An input file uses unsupported low-level
.Xr roff 7
features.
The output may be incomplete and/or misformatted,
so using GNU troff instead of
.Nm
to process the file may be preferable.
.It Cm error
Indicates a risk of information loss or severe misformatting,
in most cases caused by serious syntax errors.
.It Cm warning
Indicates a risk that the information shown or its formatting
may mismatch the author's intent in minor ways.
Additionally, syntax errors are classified at least as warnings,
even if they do not usually cause misformatting.
.It Cm style
An input file uses dubious or discouraged style.
This is not a complaint about the syntax, and probably neither
formatting nor portability are in danger.
While great care is taken to avoid false positives on the higher
message levels, the
.Cm style
level tries to reduce the probability that issues go unnoticed,
so it may occasionally issue bogus suggestions.
Please use your good judgement to decide whether any particular
.Cm style
suggestion really justifies a change to the input file.
.It Cm base
A convention used in the base system of a specific operating system
is not adhered to.
These are not markup mistakes, and neither the quality of formatting
nor portability are in danger.
Messages of the
.Cm base
level are printed with the more intuitive
.Cm style
.Ar level
tag.
.El
.Pp
Messages of the
.Cm base ,
.Cm style ,
.Cm warning ,
.Cm error ,
and
.Cm unsupp
levels except those about non-existent or unreadable input files
are hidden unless their level, or a lower level, is requested using a
.Fl W
option or
.Fl T Cm lint
output mode.
.Pp
As indicated below, all
.Cm base
and some
.Cm style
checks are only performed if a specific operating system name occurs
in the arguments of the
.Fl W
command line option, of the
.Ic \&Os
macro, of the
.Fl Ios
command line option, or, if neither are present, in the return value
of the
.Xr uname 3
function.
.Ss Conventions for base system manuals
.Bl -ohang
.It Sy "Mdocdate found"
.Pq mdoc , Nx
The
.Ic \&Dd
macro uses CVS
.Ic Mdocdate
keyword substitution, which is not supported by the
.Nx
base system.
Consider using the conventional
.Dq "Month dd, yyyy"
format instead.
.It Sy "Mdocdate missing"
.Pq mdoc , Ox
The
.Ic \&Dd
macro does not use CVS
.Ic Mdocdate
keyword substitution, but using it is conventionally expected in the
.Ox
base system.
.It Sy "unknown architecture"
.Pq mdoc , Ox , Nx
The third argument of the
.Ic \&Dt
macro does not match any of the architectures this operating system
is running on.
.It Sy "operating system explicitly specified"
.Pq mdoc , Ox , Nx
The
.Ic \&Os
macro has an argument.
In the base system, it is conventionally left blank.
.It Sy "RCS id missing"
.Pq Ox , Nx
The manual page lacks the comment line with the RCS identifier
generated by CVS
.Ic OpenBSD
or
.Ic NetBSD
keyword substitution as conventionally used in these operating systems.
.It Sy "referenced manual not found"
.Pq mdoc
An
.Ic \&Xr
macro references a manual page that is not found in the base system.
The path to look for base system manuals is configurable at compile
time and defaults to
.Pa /usr/share/man : /usr/X11R6/man .
.El
.Ss Style suggestions
.Bl -ohang
.It Sy "legacy man(7) date format"
.Pq mdoc
The
.Ic \&Dd
macro uses the legacy
.Xr man 7
date format
.Dq yyyy-dd-mm .
Consider using the conventional
.Xr mdoc 7
date format
.Dq "Month dd, yyyy"
instead.
.It Sy "normalizing date format to" : No ...
.Pq mdoc , man
The
.Ic \&Dd
or
.Ic \&TH
macro provides an abbreviated month name or a day number with a
leading zero.
In the formatted output, the month name is written out in full
and the leading zero is omitted.
.It Sy "lower case character in document title"
.Pq mdoc , man
The title is still used as given in the
.Ic \&Dt
or
.Ic \&TH
macro.
.It Sy "duplicate RCS id"
A single manual page contains two copies of the RCS identifier for
the same operating system.
Consider deleting the later instance and moving the first one up
to the top of the page.
.It Sy "possible typo in section name"
.Pq mdoc
Fuzzy string matching revealed that the argument of an
.Ic \&Sh
macro is similar, but not identical to a standard section name.
.It Sy "unterminated quoted argument"
.Pq roff
Macro arguments can be enclosed in double quote characters
such that space characters and macro names contained in the quoted
argument need not be escaped.
The closing quote of the last argument of a macro can be omitted.
However, omitting it is not recommended because it makes the code
harder to read.
.It Sy "useless macro"
.Pq mdoc
A
.Ic \&Bt ,
.Ic \&Tn ,
or
.Ic \&Ud
macro was found.
Simply delete it: it serves no useful purpose.
.It Sy "consider using OS macro"
.Pq mdoc
A string was found in plain text or in a
.Ic \&Bx
macro that could be represented using
.Ic \&Ox ,
.Ic \&Nx ,
.Ic \&Fx ,
or
.Ic \&Dx .
.It Sy "errnos out of order"
.Pq mdoc, Nx
The
.Ic \&Er
items in a
.Ic \&Bl
list are not in alphabetical order.
.It Sy "duplicate errno"
.Pq mdoc, Nx
A
.Ic \&Bl
list contains two consecutive
.Ic \&It
entries describing the same
.Ic \&Er
number.
.It Sy "trailing delimiter"
.Pq mdoc
The last argument of an
.Ic \&Ex , \&Fo , \&Nd , \&Nm , \&Os , \&Sh , \&Ss , \&St ,
or
.Ic \&Sx
macro ends with a trailing delimiter.
This is usually bad style and often indicates typos.
Most likely, the delimiter can be removed.
.It Sy "no blank before trailing delimiter"
.Pq mdoc
The last argument of a macro that supports trailing delimiter
arguments is longer than one byte and ends with a trailing delimiter.
Consider inserting a blank such that the delimiter becomes a separate
argument, thus moving it out of the scope of the macro.
.It Sy "fill mode already enabled, skipping"
.Pq man
A
.Ic \&fi
request occurs even though the document is still in fill mode,
or already switched back to fill mode.
It has no effect.
.It Sy "fill mode already disabled, skipping"
.Pq man
An
.Ic \&nf
request occurs even though the document already switched to no-fill mode
and did not switch back to fill mode yet.
It has no effect.
.It Sy "verbatim \(dq--\(dq, maybe consider using \e(em"
.Pq mdoc
Even though the ASCII output device renders an em-dash as
.Qq \-\- ,
that is not a good way to write it in an input file
because it renders poorly on all other output devices.
.It Sy "function name without markup"
.Pq mdoc
A word followed by an empty pair of parentheses occurs on a text line.
Consider using an
.Ic \&Fn
or
.Ic \&Xr
macro.
.It Sy "whitespace at end of input line"
.Pq mdoc , man , roff
Whitespace at the end of input lines is almost never semantically
significant \(em but in the odd case where it might be, it is
extremely confusing when reviewing and maintaining documents.
.It Sy "bad comment style"
.Pq roff
Comment lines start with a dot, a backslash, and a double-quote character.
The
.Nm
utility treats the line as a comment line even without the backslash,
but leaving out the backslash might not be portable.
.El
.Ss Warnings related to the document prologue
.Bl -ohang
.It Sy "missing manual title, using UNTITLED"
.Pq mdoc
A
.Ic \&Dt
macro has no arguments, or there is no
.Ic \&Dt
macro before the first non-prologue macro.
.It Sy "missing manual title, using \(dq\(dq"
.Pq man
There is no
.Ic \&TH
macro, or it has no arguments.
.It Sy "missing manual section, using \(dq\(dq"
.Pq mdoc , man
A
.Ic \&Dt
or
.Ic \&TH
macro lacks the mandatory section argument.
.It Sy "unknown manual section"
.Pq mdoc
The section number in a
.Ic \&Dt
line is invalid, but still used.
.It Sy "missing date, using today's date"
.Pq mdoc, man
The document was parsed as
.Xr mdoc 7
and it has no
.Ic \&Dd
macro, or the
.Ic \&Dd
macro has no arguments or only empty arguments;
or the document was parsed as
.Xr man 7
and it has no
.Ic \&TH
macro, or the
.Ic \&TH
macro has less than three arguments or its third argument is empty.
.It Sy "cannot parse date, using it verbatim"
.Pq mdoc , man
The date given in a
.Ic \&Dd

.Pq mdoc
If two blocks intersect, one should completely contain the other.
Otherwise, rendered output is likely to look strange in any output
format, and rendering in SGML-based output formats is likely to be
outright wrong because such languages do not support badly nested
blocks at all.
Typical examples of badly nested blocks are
.Qq Ic \&Ao \&Bo \&Ac \&Bc

.Pq roff
A conditional request is only useful if any of the following
follows it on the same logical input line:
.Bl -dash -compact
.It
The
.Sq \e{

.It
A request or macro or some text, resulting in a single-line scope.
.It
The immediate end of the logical line without any intervening whitespace,
resulting in next-line scope.

Here, a conditional request is followed by trailing whitespace only,
and there is no other content on its logical input line.
Note that it doesn't matter whether the logical input line is split
across multiple physical input lines using
.Sq \e
line continuation characters.
This is one of the rare cases
where trailing whitespace is syntactically significant.
The conditional request controls a scope containing whitespace only,
so it is unlikely to have a significant effect,

All arguments are ignored.
.It Sy "skipping excess arguments"
.Pq mdoc , man , roff
A macro or request is invoked with too many arguments:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -width 2n -compact
.It
.Ic \&Fo ,
.Ic \&MT ,
.Ic \&PD ,
.Ic \&RS ,
.Ic \&UR ,

.It Sy "input too large"
.Pq mdoc , man
Currently,
.Nm
cannot handle input files larger than its arbitrary size limit
of 2^31 bytes (2 Gigabytes).
Since useful manuals are always small, this is not a problem in practice.
Parsing is aborted as soon as the condition is detected.
.It Sy "unsupported control character"
.Pq roff
An ASCII control character supported by other
.Xr roff 7
implementations but not by
.Nm
was found in an input file.
It is replaced by a question mark.
.It Sy "unsupported roff request"
.Pq roff
An input file contains a
.Xr roff 7
request supported by GNU troff or Heirloom troff but not by
.Nm ,
and it is likely that this will cause information loss
or considerable misformatting.
.It Sy "eqn delim option in tbl"
.Pq eqn , tbl
The options line of a table defines equation delimiters.
Any equation source code contained in the table will be printed unformatted.
.It Sy "unsupported table layout modifier"
.Pq tbl
A table layout specification contains an
.Sq Cm m
modifier.
The modifier is discarded.
.It Sy "ignoring macro in table"
.Pq tbl , mdoc , man
A table contains an invocation of an
.Xr mdoc 7
or
.Xr man 7
macro or of an undefined macro.
The macro is ignored, and its arguments are handled
as if they were a text line.
