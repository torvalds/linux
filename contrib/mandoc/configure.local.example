# For all settings documented in this file, there are reasonable

# and put any of these settings into it if ./configure autodetection
# fails or if you want to make different choices for other reasons.

# If autodetection fails, please tell <tech@mandoc.bsd.lv>.

# We recommend that you write ./configure.local from scratch and
# only put the lines there you need.  This file contains examples.
# It is not intended as a template to be copied as a whole.

# --- user settings relevant for all builds ----------------------------

# For -Tutf8 and -Tlocale operation, mandoc(1) requires <locale.h>
# providing setlocale(3) and <wchar.h> providing wcwidth(3) and
# putwchar(3) with a wchar_t storing UCS-4 values.  Theoretically,
# the latter should be tested with the __STDC_ISO_10646__ feature
# macro.  In practice, many <wchar.h> headers do not provide that
# macro even though they treat wchar_t as UCS-4.  So the automatic
# test only checks that wchar_t is wide enough, that is, at least
# four bytes.

# The following line forces multi-byte support.
# If your C library does not treat wchar_t as UCS-4, the UTF-8 output
# mode will print garbage.

HAVE_WCHAR=1

# The following line disables multi-byte support.
# The output modes -Tutf8 and -Tlocale will be the same as -Tascii.

HAVE_WCHAR=0

# For -Tutf8 mode, mandoc needs to set an arbitrary locale having
# a UTF-8 character set.  If autodetection of a suitable locale
# fails or selects an undesirable locale, you can manually choose
# the locale for -Tutf8 mode:

UTF8_LOCALE=en_US.UTF-8

# When man(1) or apropos(1) is called without -m and -M options,
# MANPATH is not set in the environment, and man.conf(5) is not
# available, manuals are searched for in the following directory
# trees by default.

MANPATH_DEFAULT="/usr/share/man:/usr/X11R6/man:/usr/local/man"

# Validation of cross references with mandoc -Tlint only looks
# for manual pages in the following directories:

MANPATH_BASE="/usr/share/man:/usr/X11R6/man"

# In manual pages written in the mdoc(7) language, the operating system
# version is displayed in the page footer line.  If an operating system
# is specified as an argument to the .Os macro, that is always used.
# If the .Os macro has no argument and an operation system is specified
# with the mandoc(1) -Ios= command line option, that is used.
# Otherwise, the uname(3) library function is called at runtime to find
# the name of the operating system.
# If you do not want uname(3) to be called but instead want a fixed
# string to be used, use the following line:

OSNAME="OpenBSD 6.3"

# The following installation directories are used.
# It is possible to set only one or a few of these variables,
# there is no need to copy the whole block.
# Even if you set PREFIX to something else, the other variables
# pick it up without copying them all over.

PREFIX="/usr/local"
BINDIR="${PREFIX}/bin"
SBINDIR="${PREFIX}/sbin"
MANDIR="${PREFIX}/man"

# If BINDIR and SBINDIR are not subdirectories of the same parent
# directory or if the basename(1) of BINDIR differs from "bin",
# the relative path from SBINDIR to BINDIR is also needed.
# The default is:

BIN_FROM_SBIN="../bin"

# Some distributions may want to avoid naming conflicts
# with the configuration files of other man(1) implementations.
# This changes the name of the installed section 5 manual page as well.

MANM_MANCONF="mandoc.conf"	# default is "man.conf"

# Some distributions may want to avoid naming conflicts among manuals.
# If you want to change the names of installed section 7 manual pages,
# the following alternative names are suggested.
# The suffix ".7" will automatically be appended.
# It is possible to set only one or a few of these variables,
# there is no need to copy the whole block.

MANM_MAN="mandoc_man"		# default is "man"
MANM_MDOC="mandoc_mdoc"		# default is "mdoc"
MANM_ROFF="mandoc_roff"		# default is "roff"
MANM_EQN="mandoc_eqn"		# default is "eqn"
MANM_TBL="mandoc_tbl"		# default is "tbl"

# Some distributions may want to avoid naming conflicts with
# other man(1), apropos(1), makewhatis(8), or soelim(1) utilities.
# If you want to change the names of binary programs,
# the following alternative names are suggested.
# Using different names is possible as well.
# This changes the names of the installed section 1 and section 8
# manual pages as well.
# It is possible to set only one or two of these variables,
# there is no need to copy the whole block.

BINM_MAN=mman			# default is "man"
BINM_APROPOS=mapropos		# default is "apropos"
BINM_WHATIS=mwhatis		# default is "whatis"
BINM_MAKEWHATIS=mandocdb	# default is "makewhatis"
BINM_SOELIM=msoelim		# default is "soelim"

# Some distributions do not want hardlinks
# between installed binary programs.
# Set the following variable to use symbolic links instead.
# It is also used for links between manual pages.
# It is only used by the install* targets.
# When using this, DESTDIR must be empty or an absolute path.

LN="ln -sf"			# default is "ln -f"

# Before falling back to the bundled version of the ohash(3) hashing
# library, autoconfiguration tries the following linker flag to
# link against your system version.  If you do have ohash(3) on
# your system but it needs different linker flags, set the following
# variable to specify the required linker flags.

LD_OHASH="-lutil"

# Some platforms may need an additional linker flag for nanosleep(2).
# If none is needed or it is -lrt, it is autodetected.
# Otherwise, set the following variable.

LD_NANOSLEEP="-lrt"

# Some platforms may need an additional linker flag for recvmsg(2).
# If none is needed or it is -lsocket, it is autodetected.
# Otherwise, set the following variable.

LD_RECVMSG="-lsocket"

# Some platforms might need additional linker flags to link against
# libmandoc that are not autodetected, though no such cases are
# currently known.

LDADD="-lm"

# Some systems may want to set additional linker flags for all the
# binaries, not only for those using libmandoc, for example for
# hardening options.

LDFLAGS="-Wl,-z,relro"

# It is possible to change the utility program used for installation
# and the modes files are installed with.  The defaults are:

INSTALL="install"
INSTALL_PROGRAM="${INSTALL} -m 0555"
INSTALL_LIB="${INSTALL} -m 0444"
INSTALL_MAN="${INSTALL} -m 0444"
INSTALL_DATA="${INSTALL} -m 0444"

# When using the "homebrew" package manager on Mac OS X, the actual
# manuals are located in a so-called "cellar" and only symlinked
# into the manual trees.  To allow mandoc to follow such symlinks,
# you have to specify the physical location of the cellar as returned
# by realpath(3), for example:

PREFIX="/usr/local"
HOMEBREWDIR="${PREFIX}/Cellar"

# --- user settings for the mandoc(3) library --------------------------

# By default, libmandoc.a is not installed.  It is almost never needed
# because there is almost no non-mandoc software out there using this
# library.  The one notable exception is NetBSD apropos(1).
# So, when building for the NetBSD base system - but not for NetBSD
# ports nor for pkgsrc! - you may want the following:

INSTALL_LIBMANDOC=1

# The following settings are only used when INSTALL_LIBMANDOC is set.

INCLUDEDIR="${PREFIX}/include/mandoc"
LIBDIR="${PREFIX}/lib/mandoc"

# --- user settings related to man.cgi ---------------------------------

# By default, building man.cgi(8) is disabled.  To enable it, copy
# cgi.h.example to cgi.h, edit it, and use the following line.

BUILD_CGI=1

# The remaining settings in this section are only relevant if BUILD_CGI
# is enabled.  Otherwise, they have no effect either way.

# By default, man.cgi(8) is linked statically if the compiler supports
# the -static option.  If automatic detection fails, you can force
# static linking of man.cgi(8).

STATIC="-static"

# Some systems may require -pthread for static linking:

STATIC="-static -pthread"

# If static linking works in general but not with additional libraries
# like -lrt or -lz, you can force dynamic linking.  This may for
# example be required on SunOS 5.9.

STATIC=" "

# Some directories.
# This works just like PREFIX, see above.

WWWPREFIX="/var/www"
HTDOCDIR="${WWWPREFIX}/htdocs"
CGIBINDIR="${WWWPREFIX}/cgi-bin"

# --- user settings related to catman ----------------------------------

# By default, building mandocd(8) and catman(8) is disabled.
# To enable it, use the following line.
# It does not work on SunOS 5.10 because there is no mkdirat(2)
# nor on SunOS 5.9 which also lacks CMSG_LEN(3) and CMSG_SPACE(3).

BUILD_CATMAN=1

# Install catman(8) with a different name.
# See BINM_MAN above for details of how this works.

BINM_CATMAN=mcatman		# default is "catman"

# --- settings that rarely need to be touched --------------------------

# Do not set these variables unless you really need to.

# You can manually override the compiler to be used.
# But that's rarely useful because ./configure asks your make(1)
# which compiler to use, and that answer will hardly be wrong.

CC=cc

# Because the system compiler may not provide <stdint.h>,
# SunOS 5.9 may need:

CC=gcc

# IBM AIX may need:

CC=xlc

# Normally, leave CFLAGS unset.  In that case, -g will automatically
# be used, and various -W options will be added if the compiler
# supports them.  If you define CFLAGS manually, it will be used
# unchanged, and nothing will be added.

CFLAGS="-g"

# In rare cases, it may be required to skip individual automatic tests.
# Each of the following variables can be set to 0 (test will not be run
# and will be regarded as failed) or 1 (test will not be run and will
# be regarded as successful).

HAVE_DIRENT_NAMLEN=0
HAVE_ENDIAN=0
HAVE_EFTYPE=0
HAVE_ERR=0
HAVE_FTS=0  # Setting this implies HAVE_FTS_COMPARE_CONST=0.
HAVE_FTS_COMPARE_CONST=0  # Setting this implies HAVE_FTS=1.
HAVE_GETLINE=0
HAVE_GETSUBOPT=0
HAVE_ISBLANK=0
HAVE_MKDTEMP=0
HAVE_NTOHL=0
HAVE_O_DIRECTORY=0
HAVE_OHASH=0
HAVE_PATH_MAX=0
HAVE_PLEDGE=0
HAVE_PROGNAME=0
HAVE_REALLOCARRAY=0
HAVE_RECALLOCARRAY=0
HAVE_REWB_BSD=0
HAVE_REWB_SYSV=0
HAVE_STRCASESTR=0
HAVE_STRINGLIST=0
HAVE_STRLCAT=0
HAVE_STRLCPY=0
HAVE_STRPTIME=0
HAVE_STRSEP=0
HAVE_STRTONUM=0
HAVE_SYS_ENDIAN=0
HAVE_VASPRINTF=0
HAVE_WCHAR=0
