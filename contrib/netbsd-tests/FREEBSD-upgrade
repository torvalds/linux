This document contains a collection of notes specific to the import
of the NetBSD test suite into head.  These notes are built on the instructions
in the FreeBSD Subversion Primer that detail how to deal with vendor
branches and you are supposed to follow those:

	http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/committers-guide/subversion-primer.html

The NetBSD test source code was originally obtained via NetBSD anoncvs as
described in the NetBSD handbook:

	http://www.netbsd.org/docs/guide/en/chap-fetch.html#chap-fetch-cvs

and is imported into the NetBSD/tests vendor branch (see
base/vendor/NetBSD/tests/).

The process used to bootstrap the vendor tree was similar to the following:

	/bin/sh
	export CVSROOT="anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot"
	cvs -z9 co -D "09/30/2014 20:45" -P src/tests
	mv src/tests/* tests/dist/.

Please adjust the checkout date spec (the argument passed via -D) to match
the desired checkout time.

To merge the vendor branch into head do something like this:

	cd .../base/head/contrib/netbsd-tests
	svn merge --accept=postpone \
	    svn+ssh://svn.freebsd.org/base/vendor/NetBSD/tests/dist .
	find . -name Makefile\* | xargs svn rm --force

and resolve any conflicts that may arise at this point.

Lastly, with the list of old and new files in this import, make sure
to update the reachover Makefiles accordingly.
