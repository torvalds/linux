To build libpcap, run "./configure" (a shell script). The configure
script will determine your system attributes and generate an
appropriate Makefile from Makefile.in. Next run "make". If everything
goes well you can su to root and run "make install". However, you need
not install libpcap if you just want to build tcpdump; just make sure
the tcpdump and libpcap directory trees have the same parent
directory.

If configure says:

    configure: warning: cannot determine packet capture interface
    configure: warning: (see INSTALL for more info)

then your system either does not support packet capture or your system
does support packet capture but libpcap does not support that
particular type. (If you have HP-UX, see below.) If your system uses a
packet capture not supported by libpcap, please send us patches; don't
forget to include an autoconf fragment suitable for use in
configure.ac.

It is possible to override the default packet capture type, although
the circumstance where this works are limited. For example if you have
installed bpf under SunOS 4 and wish to build a snit libpcap:

    ./configure --with-pcap=snit

Another example is to force a supported packet capture type in the case
where the configure scripts fails to detect it.

You will need an ANSI C compiler to build libpcap. The configure script
will abort if your compiler is not ANSI compliant. If this happens, use
the generally available GNU C compiler (GCC).

You will need either Flex 2.5.31 or later, or a version of Lex
compatible with it (if any exist), to build libpcap.  The configure
script will abort if there isn't any such program.  If you have an older
version of Flex, or don't have a compatible version of Lex, the current
version of flex is available at flex.sourceforge.net.

You will need either Bison, Berkeley YACC, or a version of YACC
compatible with them (if any exist), to build libpcap.  The configure
script will abort if there isn't any such program.  If you don't have
any such program, the current version of Bison can be found at
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison/ and the current version of Berkeley YACC
can be found at http://invisible-island.net/byacc/.

Sometimes the stock C compiler does not interact well with Flex and
Bison. The list of problems includes undefined references for alloca.
You can get around this by installing GCC.

If you use Solaris, there is a bug with bufmod(7) that is fixed in
Solaris 2.3.2 (aka SunOS 5.3.2). Setting a snapshot length with the
broken bufmod(7) results in data be truncated from the FRONT of the
packet instead of the end.  The work around is to not set a snapshot
length but this results in performance problems since the entire packet
is copied to user space. If you must run an older version of Solaris,
there is a patch available from Sun; ask for bugid 1149065. After
installing the patch, use "setenv BUFMOD_FIXED" to enable use of
bufmod(7). However, we recommend you run a more current release of
Solaris.

If you use the SPARCompiler, you must be careful to not use the
/usr/ucb/cc interface. If you do, you will get bogus warnings and
perhaps errors. Either make sure your path has /opt/SUNWspro/bin
before /usr/ucb or else:

    setenv CC /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc

before running configure. (You might have to do a "make distclean"
if you already ran configure once).

Also note that "make depend" won't work; while all of the known
universe uses -M, the SPARCompiler uses -xM to generate makefile
dependencies.

If you are trying to do packet capture with a FORE ATM card, you may or
may not be able to. They usually only release their driver in object
code so unless their driver supports packet capture, there's not much
libpcap can do.

If you get an error like:

    tcpdump: recv_ack: bind error 0x???

when using DLPI, look for the DL_ERROR_ACK error return values, usually
in /usr/include/sys/dlpi.h, and find the corresponding value.

Under {DEC OSF/1, Digital UNIX, Tru64 UNIX}, packet capture must be
enabled before it can be used.  For instructions on how to enable packet
filter support, see:

	ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/dec-faq/Digital-UNIX

Look for the "How do I configure the Berkeley Packet Filter and capture
tcpdump traces?" item.

Once you enable packet filter support, your OSF system will support bpf
natively.

Under Ultrix, packet capture must be enabled before it can be used. For
instructions on how to enable packet filter support, see:

	ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/dec-faq/ultrix

If you use HP-UX, you must have at least version 9 and either the
version of cc that supports ANSI C (cc -Aa) or else use the GNU C
compiler. You must also buy the optional streams package. If you don't
have:

    /usr/include/sys/dlpi.h
    /usr/include/sys/dlpi_ext.h

then you don't have the streams package. In addition, we believe you
need to install the "9.X LAN and DLPI drivers cumulative" patch
(PHNE_6855) to make the version 9 DLPI work with libpcap.

The DLPI streams package is standard starting with HP-UX 10.

The HP implementation of DLPI is a little bit eccentric. Unlike
Solaris, you must attach /dev/dlpi instead of the specific /dev/*
network pseudo device entry in order to capture packets. The PPA is
based on the ifnet "index" number. Under HP-UX 9, it is necessary to
read /dev/kmem and the kernel symbol file (/hp-ux). Under HP-UX 10,
DLPI can provide information for determining the PPA. It does not seem
to be possible to trace the loopback interface. Unlike other DLPI
implementations, PHYS implies MULTI and SAP and you get an error if you
try to enable more than one promiscuous mode at a time.

It is impossible to capture outbound packets on HP-UX 9.  To do so on
HP-UX 10, you will, apparently, need a late "LAN products cumulative
patch" (at one point, it was claimed that this would be PHNE_18173 for
s700/10.20; at another point, it was claimed that the required patches
were PHNE_20892, PHNE_20725 and PHCO_10947, or newer patches), and to do
so on HP-UX 11 you will, apparently, need the latest lancommon/DLPI
patches and the latest driver patch for the interface(s) in use on HP-UX
11 (at one point, it was claimed that patches PHNE_19766, PHNE_19826,
PHNE_20008, and PHNE_20735 did the trick).

Furthermore, on HP-UX 10, you will need to turn on a kernel switch by
doing

	echo 'lanc_outbound_promisc_flag/W 1' | adb -w /stand/vmunix /dev/mem

You would have to arrange that this happen on reboots; the right way to
do that would probably be to put it into an executable script file
"/sbin/init.d/outbound_promisc" and making
"/sbin/rc2.d/S350outbound_promisc" a symbolic link to that script.

Finally, testing shows that there can't be more than one simultaneous
DLPI user per network interface.

If you use Linux, this version of libpcap is known to compile and run
under Red Hat 4.0 with the 2.0.25 kernel.  It may work with earlier 2.X
versions but is guaranteed not to work with 1.X kernels.  Running more
than one libpcap program at a time, on a system with a 2.0.X kernel, can
cause problems since promiscuous mode is implemented by twiddling the
interface flags from the libpcap application; the packet capture
mechanism in the 2.2 and later kernels doesn't have this problem.  Also,
packet timestamps aren't very good.  This appears to be due to haphazard
handling of the timestamp in the kernel.

Note well: there is rumoured to be a version of tcpdump floating around
called 3.0.3 that includes libpcap and is supposed to support Linux.
You should be advised that neither the Network Research Group at LBNL
nor the Tcpdump Group ever generated a release with this version number.
The LBNL Network Research Group notes with interest that a standard
cracker trick to get people to install trojans is to distribute bogus
packages that have a version number higher than the current release.
They also noted with annoyance that 90% of the Linux related bug reports
they got are due to changes made to unofficial versions of their page.
If you are having trouble but aren't using a version that came from
tcpdump.org, please try that before submitting a bug report!

On Linux, libpcap will not work if the kernel does not have the packet
socket option enabled; see the README.linux file for information about
this.

If you use AIX, you may not be able to build libpcap from this release.
We do not have an AIX system in house so it's impossible for us to test
AIX patches submitted to us.  We are told that you must link against
/lib/pse.exp, that you must use AIX cc or a GNU C compiler newer than
2.7.2, and that you may need to run strload before running a libpcap
application.

Read the README.aix file for information on installing libpcap and
configuring your system to be able to support libpcap.

If you use NeXTSTEP, you will not be able to build libpcap from this
release.

If you use SINIX, you should be able to build libpcap from this
release. It is known to compile and run on SINIX-Y/N 5.42 with the C-DS
V1.0 or V1.1 compiler. But note that in some releases of SINIX, yacc
emits incorrect code; if grammar.y fails to compile, change every
occurence of:

	#ifdef YYDEBUG

to:
	#if YYDEBUG

Another workaround is to use flex and bison.

If you use SCO, you might have trouble building libpcap from this
release. We do not have a machine running SCO and have not had reports
of anyone successfully building on it; the current release of libpcap
does not compile on SCO OpenServer 5.  Although SCO apparently supports
DLPI to some extent, the DLPI in OpenServer 5 is very non-standard, and
it appears that completely new code would need to be written to capture
network traffic.  SCO do not appear to provide tcpdump binaries for
OpenServer 5 or OpenServer 6 as part of SCO Skunkware:

	http://www.sco.com/skunkware/

If you use UnixWare, you might be able to build libpcap from this
release, or you might not.  We do not have a machine running UnixWare,
so we have not tested it; however, SCO provide packages for libpcap
0.6.2 and tcpdump 3.7.1 in the UnixWare 7/Open UNIX 8 part of SCO
Skunkware, and the source package for libpcap 0.6.2 is not changed from
the libpcap 0.6.2 source release, so this release of libpcap might also
build without changes on UnixWare 7.

If linking tcpdump fails with "Undefined: _alloca" when using bison on
a Sun4, your version of Bison is broken. In any case version 1.16 or
higher is recommended (1.14 is known to cause problems 1.16 is known to
work). Either pick up a current version from:

	http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison/

or hack around it by inserting the lines:

	#ifdef __GNUC__
	#define alloca __builtin_alloca
	#else
	#ifdef sparc
	#include <alloca.h>
	#else
	char *alloca ();
	#endif
	#endif

right after the (100 line!) GNU license comment in bison.simple, remove
grammar.[co] and fire up make again.

If you use SunOS 4, your kernel must support streams NIT. If you run a
libpcap program and it dies with:

    /dev/nit: No such device

You must add streams NIT support to your kernel configuration, run
config and boot the new kernel.
