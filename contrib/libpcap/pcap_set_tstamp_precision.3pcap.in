.TH PCAP_SET_TSTAMP_PRECISION 3PCAP "5 February 2015"
.SH NAME
pcap_set_tstamp_precision \- set the time stamp precision returned in
captures
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int pcap_set_tstamp_precision(pcap_t *p, int tstamp_precision);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_set_tstamp_precision()
sets the precision of the time stamp desired for packets captured on the pcap
descriptor to the type specified by
.IR tstamp_precision .
It must be called on a pcap descriptor created by
.B pcap_create()
that has not yet been activated by
.BR pcap_activate() .
Two time stamp precisions are supported, microseconds and nanoseconds. One can
use options
.B PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_MICRO and
.B PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NANO
to request desired precision. By default, time stamps are in microseconds.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_set_tstamp_precision()
returns 0 on success if the specified time stamp precision is expected to be
supported by the operating system,
.B PCAP_ERROR_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NOTSUP
if operating system does not support requested time stamp precision,
.B PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED
if called on a capture handle that has been activated.
