.TH PCAP_LIST_TSTAMP_TYPES 3PCAP "22 August 2010"
.SH NAME
pcap_list_tstamp_types, pcap_free_tstamp_types \- get a list of time
stamp types supported by a capture device, and free that list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int pcap_list_tstamp_types(pcap_t *p, int **tstamp_typesp);
void pcap_free_tstamp_types(int *tstamp_types);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_list_tstamp_types()
is used to get a list of the supported time stamp types of the interface
associated with the pcap descriptor.
.B pcap_list_tstamp_types()
allocates an array to hold the list and sets
.I *tstamp_typesp
to point to the array.
See
.BR pcap-tstamp (@MAN_MISC_INFO@)
for a list of all the time stamp types.
.PP
The caller is responsible for freeing the array with
.BR pcap_free_tstamp_types() ,
which frees the list pointed to by
.IR tstamp_types .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_list_tstamp_types()
returns the number of time stamp types in the array on success and
.B PCAP_ERROR
on failure.
A return value of zero means that you cannot specify a time stamp type;
you are limited to the capture device's default time stamp type.
If
.B PCAP_ERROR
is returned,
.B pcap_geterr()
or
.B pcap_perror()
may be called with
.I p
as an argument to fetch or display the error text.
