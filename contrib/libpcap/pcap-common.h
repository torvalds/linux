 * We use the "receiver-makes-right" approach to byte order,
 * because time is at a premium when we are writing the file.
 * In other words, the pcap_file_header and pcap_pkthdr,
 * records are written in host byte order.
 * Note that the bytes of packet data are written out in the order in
 * which they were received, so multi-byte fields in packets are not
 * written in host byte order, they're written in whatever order the
 * sending machine put them in.
 *
 * ntoh[ls] aren't sufficient because we might need to swap on a big-endian
 * machine (if the file was written in little-end order).
