.SH NAME
pcap_datalink \- get the link-layer header type
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
int pcap_datalink(pcap_t *p);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_datalink()
returns the link-layer header type for the live capture or ``savefile''
specified by
.IR p .
.PP
It must not be called on a pcap descriptor created by
.B pcap_create()
that has not yet been activated by
.BR pcap_activate() .
.PP
.I http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html
lists the values
.B pcap_datalink()
can return and describes the packet formats that
correspond to those values.
.PP
Do
.B NOT
assume that the packets for a given capture or ``savefile`` will have
any given link-layer header type, such as
.B DLT_EN10MB
for Ethernet.  For example, the "any" device on Linux will have a
link-layer header type of
.B DLT_LINUX_SLL
even if all devices on the system at the time the "any" device is opened
have some other data link type, such as
.B DLT_EN10MB
for Ethernet.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B pcap_datalink()
returns the link-layer header type on success and
.B PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED
if called on a capture handle that has been created but not activated.
