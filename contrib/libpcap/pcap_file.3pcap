.SH NAME
pcap_file \- get the standard I/O stream for a savefile being read
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <pcap/pcap.h>
.ft
.LP
.ft B
FILE *pcap_file(pcap_t *p);
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcap_file()
returns the standard I/O stream of the ``savefile,'' if a ``savefile''
was opened with
.BR pcap_open_offline() ,
or NULL, if a network device was opened with
.B pcap_create()
and
.BR pcap_activate() ,
or with
.BR pcap_open_live() .
.PP
Note that the Packet Capture library is usually built with large file
support, so the standard I/O stream of the ``savefile'' might refer to
a file larger than 2 gigabytes; applications that use
.B pcap_file()
should, if possible, use calls that support large files on the return
value of
.B pcap_file()
or the value returned by
.B fileno()
when passed the return value of
.BR pcap_file() .
