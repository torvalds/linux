.SH NAME
pcap-config \- write libpcap compiler and linker flags to standard output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.B pcap-config
[
.B \-\-static
]
[
.B \-\-cflags | \-\-libs | \-\-additional-libs
]
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
When run with the
.B \-\-cflags
option,
.I pcap-config
writes to the standard output the
.B \-I
compiler flags required to include libpcap's header files.
When run with the
.B \-\-libs
option,
.I pcap-config
writes to the standard output the
.B \-L
and
.B \-l
linker flags required to link with libpcap, including
.B \-l
flags for libraries required by libpcap.
When run with the
.B \-\-additional-libs
option,
.I pcap-config
writes to the standard output the
.B \-L
and
.B \-l
flags for libraries required by libpcap, but not the
.B \-lpcap
flag to link with libpcap itself.
.LP
By default, it writes flags appropriate for compiling with a
dynamically-linked version of libpcap; the
.B \-\-static
flag causes it to write flags appropriate for compiling with a
statically-linked version of libpcap.
