.SH NAME
lua \- Lua interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lua
[
.I options
]
[
.I script
[
.I args
]
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lua
is the standalone Lua interpreter.
It loads and executes Lua programs,
either in textual source form or
in precompiled binary form.
(Precompiled binaries are output by
.BR luac ,
the Lua compiler.)
.B lua
can be used as a batch interpreter and also interactively.
.LP
The given
.I options
are handled in order and then
the Lua program in file
.I script
is loaded and executed.
The given
.I args
are available to
.I script
as strings in a global table named
.BR arg .
If no options or arguments are given,
then
.B "\-v \-i"
is assumed when the standard input is a terminal;
otherwise,
.B "\-"
is assumed.
.LP
In interactive mode,
.B lua
prompts the user,
reads lines from the standard input,
and executes them as they are read.
If the line contains an expression or list of expressions,
then the line is evaluated and the results are printed.
If a line does not contain a complete statement,
then a secondary prompt is displayed and
lines are read until a complete statement is formed or
a syntax error is found.
.LP
At the very start,
before even handling the command line,
.B lua
checks the contents of the environment variables
.B LUA_INIT_5_3
or
.BR LUA_INIT ,
in that order.
If the contents is of the form
.RI '@ filename ',
then
.I filename
is executed.
Otherwise, the string is assumed to be a Lua statement and is executed.
.SH OPTIONS

.BI \-e " stat"
