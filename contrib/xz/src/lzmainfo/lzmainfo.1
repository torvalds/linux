.SH NAME
lzmainfo \- show information stored in the .lzma file header
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lzmainfo
.RB [ \-\-help ]
.RB [ \-\-version ]
.RI [ file... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lzmainfo
shows information stored in the
.B .lzma
file header.
It reads the first 13 bytes from the specified
.IR file ,
decodes the header, and prints it to standard output in human
readable format.
If no
.I files
are given or
.I file
is
.BR \- ,
standard input is read.
.PP
Usually the most interesting information is
the uncompressed size and the dictionary size.
Uncompressed size can be shown only if
the file is in the non-streamed
.B .lzma
format variant.
The amount of memory required to decompress the file is
a few dozen kilobytes plus the dictionary size.
.PP
.B lzmainfo
is included in XZ Utils primarily for
backward compatibility with LZMA Utils.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.TP
.B 0
All is good.
.TP
.B 1
An error occurred.
.SH BUGS
.B lzmainfo
uses
.B MB
while the correct suffix would be
.B MiB
(2^20 bytes).
This is to keep the output compatible with LZMA Utils.
