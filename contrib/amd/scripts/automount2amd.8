.TH AUTOMOUNT2AMD 8L "24 May 1993"
.SH NAME
automount2amd \- converts old Sun automount maps to Amd maps
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B automount2amd
.I auto.map
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B automount2amd
is used to convert an old Sun automount maps named
.I auto.map
to an Amd map.

This perl script will use the following /default entry
.nf
    type:=nfs;opts:=rw,grpid,nosuid,utimeout=600
.fi
If you wish to override that, define the
.B $DEFAULTS
environment variable, or modify the script.

If you wish to generate Amd maps using the
.I hostd
(host domain) Amd map syntax, then define the environment variable
.B $DOMAIN
or modify the script.

.SH EXAMPLE
Say you have the Sun automount file auto.foo, with these two lines:
.nf
  home                  earth:/home
  moon  -ro,intr        server:/proj/images
.fi
Running
.nf
    automount2amd auto.foo > amd.foo
.fi
will produce the Amd map
.I amd.foo
with this content:
.nf
# generated by automount2amd on Sat Aug 14 17:59:32 US/Eastern 1999

/defaults \\
  type:=nfs;opts:=rw,grpid,nosuid,utimeout=600

home \
  host==earth;type:=link;fs:=/home \\
  rhost:=earth;rfs:=/home

moon \
  -addopts:=ro,intr \\
  host==server;type:=link;fs:=/proj/images \\
  rhost:=server;rfs:=/proj/images
.fi
.SH BUGS

does not understand newer Sun Automount map syntax, those used by autofs.
