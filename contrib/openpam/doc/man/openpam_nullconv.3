.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn openpam_nullconv
function is a null conversation function suitable
for applications that want to use PAM but don't support interactive
dialog with the user.
Such applications should set
.Dv PAM_AUTHTOK
to whatever authentication
token they've obtained on their own before calling
.Xr pam_authenticate 3
and / or
.Xr pam_chauthtok 3 ,
and their PAM configuration should specify the
.Dv use_first_pass
option for all modules that require access to the
authentication token, to make sure they use
.Dv PAM_AUTHTOK
rather than
try to query the user.
