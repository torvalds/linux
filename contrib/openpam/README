OpenPAM is an open source PAM library that focuses on simplicity,
correctness, and cleanliness.

OpenPAM aims to gather the best features of Solaris PAM, XSSO and
Linux-PAM, plus some innovations of its own.  In areas where these
implementations disagree, OpenPAM tries to remain compatible with
Solaris, at the expense of XSSO conformance and Linux-PAM
compatibility.
