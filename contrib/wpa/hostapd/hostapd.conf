# In case of atheros and nl80211 driver interfaces, an additional

# /sys) and this parameter may not be needed.
#
# For nl80211, this parameter can be used to request the AP interface to be

# has been started to change the interface mode). If needed, the bridge
# interface is also created.

# multiple hostapd processes/interfaces can be run at the same time if more

# change the network configuration, this access needs to be protected in many
# cases. By default, hostapd is configured to use gid 0 (root). If you

# ACS tuning - Automatic Channel Selection
# See: http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/acs
#
# You can customize the ACS survey algorithm with following variables:
#
# acs_num_scans requirement is 1..100 - number of scans to be performed that
# are used to trigger survey data gathering of an underlying device driver.
# Scans are passive and typically take a little over 100ms (depending on the
# driver) on each available channel for given hw_mode. Increasing this value
# means sacrificing startup time and gathering more data wrt channel
# interference that may help choosing a better channel. This can also help fine
# tune the ACS scan time in case a driver has different scan dwell times.
#
# acs_chan_bias is a space-separated list of <channel>:<bias> pairs. It can be
# used to increase (or decrease) the likelihood of a specific channel to be
# selected by the ACS algorithm. The total interference factor for each channel
# gets multiplied by the specified bias value before finding the channel with
# the lowest value. In other words, values between 0.0 and 1.0 can be used to
# make a channel more likely to be picked while values larger than 1.0 make the
# specified channel less likely to be picked. This can be used, e.g., to prefer
# the commonly used 2.4 GHz band channels 1, 6, and 11 (which is the default
# behavior on 2.4 GHz band if no acs_chan_bias parameter is specified).

##### WPA/IEEE 802.11i configuration ##########################################

# Enable WPA. Setting this variable configures the AP to require WPA (either
# WPA-PSK or WPA-RADIUS/EAP based on other configuration). For WPA-PSK, either
# wpa_psk or wpa_passphrase must be set and wpa_key_mgmt must include WPA-PSK.
# Instead of wpa_psk / wpa_passphrase, wpa_psk_radius might suffice.
# For WPA-RADIUS/EAP, ieee8021x must be set (but without dynamic WEP keys),

# Workaround for key reinstallation attacks
#
# This parameter can be used to disable retransmission of EAPOL-Key frames that
# are used to install keys (EAPOL-Key message 3/4 and group message 1/2). This
# is similar to setting wpa_group_update_count=1 and

# extended timeout on the response to avoid causing issues with stations that
# may use aggressive power saving have very long time in replying to the
# EAPOL-Key messages.
#
# This option can be used to work around key reinstallation attacks on the
# station (supplicant) side in cases those station devices cannot be updated
# for some reason. By removing the retransmissions the attacker cannot cause
# key reinstallation with a delayed frame transmission. This is related to the
# station side vulnerabilities CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13079,
# CVE-2017-13080, and CVE-2017-13081.
#
# This workaround might cause interoperability issues and reduced robustness of
# key negotiation especially in environments with heavy traffic load due to the
# number of attempts to perform the key exchange is reduced significantly. As
# such, this workaround is disabled by default (unless overridden in build
# configuration). To enable this, set the parameter to 1.

# SAE password
# This parameter can be used to set passwords for SAE. By default, the

# wpa_passphrase follows the WPA-PSK constraints (8..63 characters) even though
# SAE passwords do not have such constraints. If the BSS enabled both SAE and
# WPA-PSK and both values are set, SAE uses the sae_password values and WPA-PSK
# uses the wpa_passphrase value.
#
# Each sae_password entry is added to a list of available passwords. This
# corresponds to the dot11RSNAConfigPasswordValueEntry. sae_password value
# starts with the password (dot11RSNAConfigPasswordCredential). That value can
# be followed by optional peer MAC address (dot11RSNAConfigPasswordPeerMac) and
# by optional password identifier (dot11RSNAConfigPasswordIdentifier). If the
# peer MAC address is not included or is set to the wildcard address
# (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff), the entry is available for any station to use. If a
# specific peer MAC address is included, only a station with that MAC address
# is allowed to use the entry. If the password identifier (with non-zero length)
# is included, the entry is limited to be used only with that specified
# identifier. The last matching (based on peer MAC address and identifier) entry
# is used to select which password to use. Setting sae_password to an empty
# string has a special meaning of removing all previously added entries.
# sae_password uses the following encoding:

# WPS capability discovery workaround for PBC with Windows 7
# Windows 7 uses incorrect way of figuring out AP's WPS capabilities by acting
# as a Registrar and using M1 from the AP. The config methods attribute in that
# message is supposed to indicate only the configuration method supported by
# the AP in Enrollee role, i.e., to add an external Registrar. For that case,
# PBC shall not be used and as such, the PushButton config method is removed
# from M1 by default. If pbc_in_m1=1 is included in the configuration file,
# the PushButton config method is left in M1 (if included in config_methods
# parameter) to allow Windows 7 to use PBC instead of PIN (e.g., from a label
# in the AP).
#pbc_in_m1=1

# Static access point PIN for initial configuration and adding Registrars
# If not set, hostapd will not allow external WPS Registrars to control the
# access point. The AP PIN can also be set at runtime with hostapd_cli
# wps_ap_pin command. Use of temporary (enabled by user action) and random
# AP PIN is much more secure than configuring a static AP PIN here. As such,
# use of the ap_pin parameter is not recommended if the AP device has means for
# displaying a random PIN.

# message when acting as a Registrar. If skip_cred_build=1, this data will also
# be able to override the Credential attribute that would have otherwise been
# automatically generated based on network configuration. This configuration

# Note: With wps_cred_processing=1, skip_cred_build should be set to 1 and
# extra_cred be used to provide the Credential data for Enrollees.
#
# wps_cred_processing=1 will disabled automatic updates of hostapd.conf file
# both for Credential processing and for marking AP Setup Locked based on
# validation failures of AP PIN. An external program is responsible on updating
# the configuration appropriately in this case.

# AP Settings Attributes for M7
# By default, hostapd generates the AP Settings Attributes for M7 based on the

##### Multiple BSSID support ##################################################
#
# Above configuration is using the default interface (wlan#, or multi-SSID VLAN
# interfaces). Other BSSIDs can be added by using separator 'bss' with
# default interface name to be allocated for the data packets of the new BSS.
#
# hostapd will generate BSSID mask based on the BSSIDs that are
# configured. hostapd will verify that dev_addr & MASK == dev_addr. If this is
# not the case, the MAC address of the radio must be changed before starting
# hostapd (ifconfig wlan0 hw ether <MAC addr>). If a BSSID is configured for
# every secondary BSS, this limitation is not applied at hostapd and other
# masks may be used if the driver supports them (e.g., swap the locally
# administered bit)
#
# BSSIDs are assigned in order to each BSS, unless an explicit BSSID is
# specified using the 'bssid' parameter.
# If an explicit BSSID is specified, it must be chosen such that it:
# - results in a valid MASK that covers it and the dev_addr
# - is not the same as the MAC address of the radio
# - is not the same as any other explicitly specified BSSID
#
# Alternatively, the 'use_driver_iface_addr' parameter can be used to request
# hostapd to use the driver auto-generated interface address (e.g., to use the
# exact MAC addresses allocated to the device).
#
# Not all drivers support multiple BSSes. The exact mechanism for determining
# the driver capabilities is driver specific. With the current (i.e., a recent
# kernel) drivers using nl80211, this information can be checked with "iw list"
# (search for "valid interface combinations").
#
# Please note that hostapd uses some of the values configured for the first BSS
# as the defaults for the following BSSes. However, it is recommended that all
# BSSes include explicit configuration of all relevant configuration items.
#
#bss=wlan0_0
#ssid=test2
# most of the above items can be used here (apart from radio interface specific
# items, like channel)

#bss=wlan0_1
#bssid=00:13:10:95:fe:0b
