Contributions to hostap.git
---------------------------

This software is distributed under a permissive open source license to
allow it to be used in any projects, whether open source or proprietary.
Contributions to the project are welcome and it is important to maintain
clear record of contributions and terms under which they are licensed.
To help with this, following procedure is used to allow acceptance and
recording of the terms.

All contributions are expected to be licensed under the modified BSD
license (see below). Acknowledgment of the terms is tracked through
inclusion of Signed-off-by tag in the contributions at the end of the
commit log message. This tag indicates that the contributor agrees with
the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) version 1.1 terms (see below;
also available from http://developercertificate.org/).


The current requirements for contributions to hostap.git
--------------------------------------------------------

To indicate your acceptance of Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1
terms, please add the following line to the end of the commit message
for each contribution you make to the project:

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.example.org>

using your real name. Pseudonyms or anonymous contributions cannot
unfortunately be accepted.


The preferred method of submitting the contribution to the project is by
email to the hostap mailing list:
hostap@lists.infradead.org
Note that the list may require subscription before accepting message
without moderation. You can subscribe to the list at this address:
http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/hostap

The message should contain an inlined patch against the current
development branch (i.e., the master branch of
git://w1.fi/hostap.git). Please make sure the software you use for
sending the patch does not corrupt whitespace. If that cannot be fixed
for some reason, it is better to include an attached version of the
patch file than just send a whitespace damaged version in the message
body.

The patches should be separate logical changes rather than doing
everything in a single patch. In other words, please keep cleanup, new
features, and bug fixes all in their own patches. Each patch needs a
commit log that describes the changes (what the changes fix, what
functionality is added, why the changes are useful, etc.).

Please try to follow the coding style used in the project.

In general, the best way of generating a suitable formatted patch file
is by committing the changes to a cloned git repository and using git
format-patch. The patch can then be sent, e.g., with git send-email.


History of license and contributions terms
------------------------------------------

Until February 11, 2012, in case of most files in hostap.git, "under the
open source license indicated in the file" means that the contribution
is licensed both under GPL v2 and modified BSD license (see below) and
the choice between these licenses is given to anyone who redistributes
or uses the software. As such, the contribution has to be licensed under
both options to allow this choice.

As of February 11, 2012, the project has chosen to use only the BSD
license option for future distribution. As such, the GPL v2 license
option is no longer used and the contributions are not required to be
licensed until GPL v2. In case of most files in hostap.git, "under the
open source license indicated in the file" means that the contribution
is licensed under the modified BSD license (see below).

Until February 13, 2014, the project used an extended version of the DCO
that included the identical items (a) through (d) from DCO 1.1 and an
additional item (e):

(e) The contribution can be licensed under the modified BSD license
    as shown below even in case of files that are currently licensed
    under other terms.

This was used during the period when some of the files included the old
license terms. Acceptance of this extended DCO version was indicated
with a Signed-hostap tag in the commit message. This additional item (e)
was used to collect explicit approval to license the contribution with
only the modified BSD license (see below), i.e., without the GPL v2
option. This was done to allow simpler licensing terms to be used in the
future. It should be noted that the modified BSD license is compatible
with GNU GPL and as such, this possible move to simpler licensing option
does not prevent use of this software in GPL projects.
