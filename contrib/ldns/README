* Development 
ldns is mainly developed on Linux and FreeBSD. It is regularly tested to
compile on other systems like Solaris and Mac OS X.

REQUIREMENTS
- OpenSSL (Optional, but needed for features like DNSSEC)
  - OpenSSL >= 0.9.7f for DANE support
  - OpenSSL >= 1.0.0  for ECDSA and GOST support
- libpcap (Optional, but needed for examples/ldns-dpa)
- (GNU) libtool (in OSX, that's glibtool, not libtool)
- GNU make

INSTALLATION
1. Unpack the tarball
2. cd ldns-<VERSION>
3. ./configure --with-examples --with-drill
   (optionally compile python bindings too with: --with-pyldns)
4. make
5. make install


* Building from repository

If you are building from the repository you will need to have (gnu)
autotools like libtool and autoreconf installed. A list of all the commands
needed to build everything can be found in README.git. Note that the actual
commands may be a little bit different on your machine. Most notably, you'll
need to run libtoolize (or glibtoolize). If you skip this step, you'll get
an error about missing config.sub.

* Developers
ldns is developed by the ldns team at NLnet Labs. This team currently
consists of:
  o Willem Toorop
  o Wouter Wijngaards
  o Matthijs Mekking

Former main developers:
  o Jelte Jansen
  o Miek Gieben

INFORMATION FOR SPECIFIC OPERATING SYSTEMS

MAC OS X

For MACOSX 10.4 and later, it seems that you have to set the
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable to 10.4 before running
make. Apparently it defaults to 10.1.

This appears to be a known problem in 10.2 to 10.4, see:
http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1233.html
for more information.


SOLARIS

In Solaris multi-architecture systems (which have both 32-bit and
64-bit support), it can be a bit taxing to convince the system to
compile in 64-bit mode. Jakob Schlyter has kindly contributed a build
script that sets the right build and link options. You can find it in
contrib/build-solaris.sh

KNOWN ISSUES

A complete list of currently known open issues can be found here:
http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/ldns/bugs

* pyldns
Compiling pyldns produces many ``unused parameter'' warnings.  Those are
harmless and may safely be ignored.
Also, when building with SWIG older than 2.0.4, compiling
pyldns produces many ``missing initializer'' warnings. Those are harmless
too.

Your Support
NLnet Labs offers all of its software products as open source, most
published under a BSD license. You can download them, not only from the
NLnet Labs website but also through the various OS distributions for
which NSD, ldns, and Unbound are packaged. We therefore have little idea
who uses our software in production environments and have no direct ties
with 'our customers'.

Therefore, we ask you to contact us at users@NLnetLabs.nl and tell us
whether you use one of our products in your production environment,
what that environment looks like, and maybe even share some praise.
We would like to refer to the fact that your organization is using our
products. We will only do that if you explicitly allow us. In all other
cases we will keep the information you share with us to ourselves.

In addition to the moral support you can also support us
financially. NLnet Labs is a recognized not-for-profit charity foundation
that is chartered to develop open-source software and open-standards
for the Internet. If you use our software to satisfaction please express
that by giving us a donation. For small donations PayPal can be used. For
larger and regular donations please contact us at users@NLnetLabs.nl. Also
