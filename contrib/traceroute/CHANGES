v1.4 Wed Dec 13 22:50:35 PST 2000

- Add an option to use icmp echo instead of udp datagrams.

- Add HPUX and Linux support.

- Handle hex argument values as suggested by John Hawkinson
  (jhawk@mit.edu)

- Added flags to set the first ttl and to set the don't fragment bit.

- Add a local autoconf macro to check for routines in libraries; the
  autoconf version is broken (it only puts the library name in the
  cache variable name). Thanks to John Hawkinson.

- Add a local autoconf macro to check for types; the autoconf version
  is broken (it uses grep instead of actually compiling a code fragment).

- Attempt to detect "egcs" versions of gcc.

- Fix problems caused by savestr().

- Detect when there are more interfaces than we can deal with. Thanks
  to Guy Harris guy@netapp.com.

- Accommodate changes made to FreeBSD 3.2-RELEASE network headers files.

- The ip header offset needs to be byte swapped under Solaris on the
  intel as well. Reported by John McDermott (jjm@jkintl.com) Also byte
  ip length and offset for linux.

- In wait_for_reply(), use passed socket instead of global one. Thanks
  to Richard Kettlewell (richard.kettlewell@kewill.com)

- Check for IFF_LOOPBACK as a define or an enum (concession to linux).
  Reported by Robert Bihlmeyer (robbe@orcus.priv.at)

- Increase size of SIOCGIFCONF buffer to accommodate systems with lots
  of virtual interfaces. Ignore sun virtual interfaces. Suggested by
  Ian Donaldson (iand@aone.com.au)

- Always calculate icmp checksums when using -I. Reported by Soumen
  (sbiswas@novell.com)

- Documentation fix for description of -p. Thanks to Jeffrey C Honig
  (jch@bsdi.com)

- Enable ip checksums for Solaris 2.6 and higher (since they seem to
  work correctly now).

- Avoid problems when broken routers return 0.0.0.0 as their source
  address. Thanks to John Hawkinson (jhawk@bbnplanet.com)

- Canonicalize hostname if gethostname() doesn't return a domain.

- Add -z flag (pause msecs) to allow optional pause between probes.
  Suggested by Dave Morrison (drmorris@uplanet.com)

- Fix max packet length test.

- Use "/dev/null" instead of "." for file descriptor fodder.
  Suggested by Tim Robbins (fyre@box3n.gumbynet.org)

- Watch for a NULL argv[0]. Suggested by Tim Robbins.

- Be careful with hostname legnths.

- Print RFC1191 Path MTU Discovery value on "needfrag" unreachables.

- Limit port size to 16 bits. Suggested by Tim Robbins.

- Limit wait time to 24 hours.

- Modified linux specific struct ipovly definition to avoid problems
  with 64 bit systems. Problem reported by Uros Prestor
  (uros@turbolinux.com)

- Use kernel routing tables to determine correct source address.
  Three styles are supported: bsd/socket, solaris/mib and linux.

- Fix configure to recognize older versions of Solaris.

v1.3.2 Thu Sep 26 18:06:16 PDT 1996

- Rewrite source routing code to eliminate a number of problems on
  systems using raw ip options. Also pad options with a noop so gateway
  addresses are aligned.

- Don't call inet_ntoa() twice in the same printf(). Thanks to NetBSD
  via Bill Fenner (fenner@parc.xerox.com)

- Decode "administratively prohibited filter" icmp code and print
  numeric value for unknown codes. Thanks to Bill Fenner.

v1.3.1 Wed Sep 18 21:08:16 PDT 1996

- Some systems (e.g. AIX) need sys/select.h. Thanks to Brett Hogden
  (hogden@rge.com)

- Byte swap ip header length under Solaris. (This has no effect on the
  sparc but is required on the i386.)

- Made optional packet length control total size of packet.

v1.3 Mon Sep 16 14:55:44 PDT 1996

- Overrun buffer security fixes. Thanks to Bill Fenner
  (fenner@parc.xerox.com)

- Wait for response packet relative to start of probe. Thanks to Bill
  Fenner.

- Fix bug that prevented changing the packet size. Thanks to Gregory
  Decker (gdecker@nate.dcrt.nih.gov)

- Add support for RAW_OPTIONS (e.g. 4.4 BSD systems such as BSD/OS and
  FreeBSD) thanks to Jeffrey C Honig (jch@bsdi.com)

- Remove ip header byte swap fix from v1.2; most kernels swap the ip
  header length in the kernel (and it causes OSF3 to crash).

- Fix to not exit when the number of probes is set to 1 (i.e. "-q 1")

- Improve autoconf configuration.

v1.2 Tue Oct 17 23:50:05 PDT 1995

- Convert to autoconf and ansify.

- Byte swap ip header length for little endian machines. Fix thanks to
  Y Badri (yb@greybox.demon.co.uk).

v1.1 Thu Jun 15 02:32:55 PDT 1995

- Check for too many arguments.

- Recode to make timing of packet's round trip more obvious and to
  tighten up code.

- Ifdef IP_OPTIONS code.

- Display time in microseconds.

v1.0 Tue Feb 28 23:50:05 PDT 1989

- Initial public release.
