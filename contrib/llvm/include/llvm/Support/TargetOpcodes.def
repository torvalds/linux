/// KILL - This instruction is a noop that is used only to adjust the
/// liveness of registers. This can be useful when dealing with
/// sub-registers.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(KILL)

/// EXTRACT_SUBREG - This instruction takes two operands: a register
/// that has subregisters, and a subregister index. It returns the
/// extracted subregister value. This is commonly used to implement
/// truncation operations on target architectures which support it.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(EXTRACT_SUBREG)

/// INSERT_SUBREG - This instruction takes three operands: a register that
/// has subregisters, a register providing an insert value, and a
/// subregister index. It returns the value of the first register with the
/// value of the second register inserted. The first register is often
/// defined by an IMPLICIT_DEF, because it is commonly used to implement
/// anyext operations on target architectures which support it.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(INSERT_SUBREG)

/// IMPLICIT_DEF - This is the MachineInstr-level equivalent of undef.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(IMPLICIT_DEF)

/// SUBREG_TO_REG - Assert the value of bits in a super register.
/// The result of this instruction is the value of the second operand inserted
/// into the subregister specified by the third operand. All other bits are
/// assumed to be equal to the bits in the immediate integer constant in the
/// first operand. This instruction just communicates information; No code
/// should be generated.
/// This is typically used after an instruction where the write to a subregister
/// implicitly cleared the bits in the super registers.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(SUBREG_TO_REG)

/// COPY_TO_REGCLASS - This instruction is a placeholder for a plain
/// register-to-register copy into a specific register class. This is only
/// used between instruction selection and MachineInstr creation, before
/// virtual registers have been created for all the instructions, and it's
/// only needed in cases where the register classes implied by the
/// instructions are insufficient. It is emitted as a COPY MachineInstr.
  HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(COPY_TO_REGCLASS)

/// DBG_VALUE - a mapping of the llvm.dbg.value intrinsic
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(DBG_VALUE)

/// DBG_LABEL - a mapping of the llvm.dbg.label intrinsic
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(DBG_LABEL)

/// REG_SEQUENCE - This variadic instruction is used to form a register that
/// represents a consecutive sequence of sub-registers. It's used as a
/// register coalescing / allocation aid and must be eliminated before code
/// emission.
// In SDNode form, the first operand encodes the register class created by
// the REG_SEQUENCE, while each subsequent pair names a vreg + subreg index
// pair.  Once it has been lowered to a MachineInstr, the regclass operand
// is no longer present.
/// e.g. v1027 = REG_SEQUENCE v1024, 3, v1025, 4, v1026, 5
/// After register coalescing references of v1024 should be replace with
/// v1027:3, v1025 with v1027:4, etc.
  HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(REG_SEQUENCE)

/// COPY - Target-independent register copy. This instruction can also be
/// used to copy between subregisters of virtual registers.

/// BUNDLE - This instruction represents an instruction bundle. Instructions
/// which immediately follow a BUNDLE instruction which are marked with
/// 'InsideBundle' flag are inside the bundle.

/// Lifetime markers.

/// A Stackmap instruction captures the location of live variables at its

/// that must lie within the function and not contain another stackmap.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(STACKMAP)

/// FEntry all - This is a marker instruction which gets translated into a raw fentry call.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(FENTRY_CALL)

/// Patchable call instruction - this instruction represents a call to a
/// constant address, followed by a series of NOPs. It is intended to
/// support optimizations for dynamic languages (such as javascript) that
/// rewrite calls to runtimes with more efficient code sequences.
/// This also implies a stack map.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(PATCHPOINT)

/// This pseudo-instruction loads the stack guard value. Targets which need
/// to prevent the stack guard value or address from being spilled to the
/// stack should override TargetLowering::emitLoadStackGuardNode and
/// additionally expand this pseudo after register allocation.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(LOAD_STACK_GUARD)

/// Call instruction with associated vm state for deoptimization and list
/// of live pointers for relocation by the garbage collector.  It is
/// intended to support garbage collection with fully precise relocating
/// collectors and deoptimizations in either the callee or caller.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(STATEPOINT)

/// Instruction that records the offset of a local stack allocation passed to
/// llvm.localescape. It has two arguments: the symbol for the label and the
/// frame index of the local stack allocation.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(LOCAL_ESCAPE)

/// Wraps a machine instruction which can fault, bundled with associated
/// information on how to handle such a fault.
/// For example loading instruction that may page fault, bundled with associated
/// information on how to handle such a page fault.  It is intended to support
/// "zero cost" null checks in managed languages by allowing LLVM to fold
/// comparisons into existing memory operations.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(FAULTING_OP)

/// Wraps a machine instruction to add patchability constraints.  An
/// instruction wrapped in PATCHABLE_OP has to either have a minimum
/// size or be preceded with a nop of that size.  The first operand is
/// an immediate denoting the minimum size of the instruction, the
/// second operand is an immediate denoting the opcode of the original
/// instruction.  The rest of the operands are the operands of the
/// original instruction.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(PATCHABLE_OP)

/// This is a marker instruction which gets translated into a nop sled, useful
/// for inserting instrumentation instructions at runtime.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(PATCHABLE_FUNCTION_ENTER)

/// Wraps a return instruction and its operands to enable adding nop sleds
/// either before or after the return. The nop sleds are useful for inserting
/// instrumentation instructions at runtime.
/// The patch here replaces the return instruction.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(PATCHABLE_RET)

/// This is a marker instruction which gets translated into a nop sled, useful
/// for inserting instrumentation instructions at runtime.
/// The patch here prepends the return instruction.
/// The same thing as in x86_64 is not possible for ARM because it has multiple
/// return instructions. Furthermore, CPU allows parametrized and even
/// conditional return instructions. In the current ARM implementation we are
/// making use of the fact that currently LLVM doesn't seem to generate
/// conditional return instructions.
/// On ARM, the same instruction can be used for popping multiple registers
/// from the stack and returning (it just pops pc register too), and LLVM
/// generates it sometimes. So we can't insert the sled between this stack
/// adjustment and the return without splitting the original instruction into 2
/// instructions. So on ARM, rather than jumping into the exit trampoline, we
/// call it, it does the tracing, preserves the stack and returns.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(PATCHABLE_FUNCTION_EXIT)

/// Wraps a tail call instruction and its operands to enable adding nop sleds
/// either before or after the tail exit. We use this as a disambiguation from
/// PATCHABLE_RET which specifically only works for return instructions.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(PATCHABLE_TAIL_CALL)

/// Wraps a logging call and its arguments with nop sleds. At runtime, this can
/// be patched to insert instrumentation instructions.
HANDLE_TARGET_OPCODE(PATCHABLE_EVENT_CALL)

/// Wraps a typed logging call and its argument with nop sleds. At runtime, this
/// can be patched to insert instrumentation instructions.
