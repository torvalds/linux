# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
#
# Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
# for time zone data was the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
# IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
#
# A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
# Derek Howse, Greenwich time and longitude, Philip Wilson Publishers (1997).
#
# Except where otherwise noted, Shanks & Pottenger is the source for
# entries through 1991, and IATA SSIM is the source for entries afterwards.

# Britain (United Kingdom) and Ireland (Eire)

# From Peter Ilieve (1994-07-06):
#
# On 17 Jan 1994 the Independent, a UK quality newspaper, had a piece about
# historical vistas along the Thames in west London. There was a photo
# and a sketch map showing some of the sightlines involved. One paragraph
# of the text said:
#
# 'An old stone obelisk marking a forgotten terrestrial meridian stands
# beside the river at Kew. In the 18th century, before time and longitude
# was standardised by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, scholars observed
# this stone and the movement of stars from Kew Observatory nearby. They
# made their calculations and set the time for the Horse Guards and Parliament,
# but now the stone is obscured by scrubwood and can only be seen by walking
# along the towpath within a few yards of it.'
#
# I have a one inch to one mile map of London and my estimate of the stone's
# position is 51° 28' 30" N, 0° 18' 45" W. The longitude should
# be within about ±2". The Ordnance Survey grid reference is TQ172761.
#
# [This yields GMTOFF = -0:01:15 for London LMT in the 18th century.]

# From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):
#
# Howse writes that Britain was the first country to use standard time.
# The railways cared most about the inconsistencies of local mean time,
# and it was they who forced a uniform time on the country.
# The original idea was credited to Dr. William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828)
# and was popularized by Abraham Follett Osler (1808-1903).
# The first railway to adopt London time was the Great Western Railway
# in November 1840; other railways followed suit, and by 1847 most
# (though not all) railways used London time.  On 1847-09-22 the
# Railway Clearing House, an industry standards body, recommended that GMT be
# adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it.
# The transition occurred on 12-01 for the L&NW, the Caledonian,
# and presumably other railways; the January 1848 Bradshaw's lists many
# railways as using GMT.  By 1855 the vast majority of public
# clocks in Britain were set to GMT (though some, like the great clock
# on Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford, were fitted with two minute hands,
# one for local time and one for GMT).  The last major holdout was the legal
# system, which stubbornly stuck to local time for many years, leading
# to oddities like polls opening at 08:13 and closing at 16:13.
# The legal system finally switched to GMT when the Statutes (Definition
# of Time) Act took effect; it received the Royal Assent on 1880-08-02.
#
# In the tables below, we condense this complicated story into a single
# transition date for London, namely 1847-12-01.  We don't know as much
# about Dublin, so we use 1880-08-02, the legal transition time.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-19):
# The ancients had no need for daylight saving, as they kept time
# informally or via hours whose length depended on the time of year.
# Daylight saving time in its modern sense was invented by the
# New Zealand entomologist George Vernon Hudson (1867-1946),
# whose day job as a postal clerk led him to value
# after-hours daylight in which to pursue his research.
# In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society
# that proposed a two-hour daylight-saving shift.  See:
# Hudson GV. On seasonal time-adjustment in countries south of lat. 30°.
# Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute. 1895;28:734
# http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_28/rsnz_28_00_006110.html
# Although some interest was expressed in New Zealand, his proposal
# did not find its way into law and eventually it was almost forgotten.
#
# In England, DST was independently reinvented by William Willett (1857-1915),
# a London builder and member of the Royal Astronomical Society
# who circulated a pamphlet "The Waste of Daylight" (1907)
# that proposed advancing clocks 20 minutes on each of four Sundays in April,
# and retarding them by the same amount on four Sundays in September.
# A bill was drafted in 1909 and introduced in Parliament several times,
# but it met with ridicule and opposition, especially from farming interests.
# Later editions of the pamphlet proposed one-hour summer time, and
# it was eventually adopted as a wartime measure in 1916.
# See: Summer Time Arrives Early, The Times (2000-05-18).
# A monument to Willett was unveiled on 1927-05-21, in an open space in
# a 45-acre wood near Chislehurst, Kent that was purchased by popular
# subscription and open to the public.  On the south face of the monolith,
# designed by G. W. Miller, is the William Willett Memorial Sundial,
# which is permanently set to Summer Time.

# From Winston Churchill (1934-04-28):
# It is one of the paradoxes of history that we should owe the boon of
# summer time, which gives every year to the people of this country
# between 160 and 170 hours more daylight leisure, to a war which
# plunged Europe into darkness for four years, and shook the
# foundations of civilization throughout the world.

# From Paul Eggert (2015-08-08):
# The OED Supplement says that the English originally said "Daylight Saving"
# when they were debating the adoption of DST in 1908; but by 1916 this
# term appears only in quotes taken from DST's opponents, whereas the
# proponents (who eventually won the argument) are quoted as using "Summer".
# The term "Summer Time" was introduced by Herbert Samuel, Home Secretary; see:
# Viscount Samuel. Leisure in a Democracy. Cambridge University Press
# ISBN 978-1-107-49471-8 (1949, reissued 2015), p 8.

# From Arthur David Olson (1989-01-19):
# A source at the British Information Office in New York avers that it's
# known as "British" Summer Time in all parts of the United Kingdom.

# Date: 4 Jan 89 08:57:25 GMT (Wed)
# From: Jonathan Leffler
# [British Summer Time] is fixed annually by Act of Parliament.
# If you can predict what Parliament will do, you should be in
# politics making a fortune, not computing.

# From Chris Carrier (1996-06-14):
# I remember reading in various wartime issues of the London Times the
# acronym BDST for British Double Summer Time.  Look for the published
# time of sunrise and sunset in The Times, when BDST was in effect, and
# if you find a zone reference it will say, "All times B.D.S.T."

# From Joseph S. Myers (1999-09-02):
# ... some military cables (WO 219/4100 - this is a copy from the
# main SHAEF archives held in the US National Archives, SHAEF/5252/8/516)
# agree that the usage is BDST (this appears in a message dated 17 Feb 1945).

# From Joseph S. Myers (2000-10-03):
# On 18th April 1941, Sir Stephen Tallents of the BBC wrote to Sir
# Alexander Maxwell of the Home Office asking whether there was any
# official designation; the reply of the 21st was that there wasn't
# but he couldn't think of anything better than the "Double British
# Summer Time" that the BBC had been using informally.
# https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/bbc-19410418.png
# https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/ho-19410421.png

# From Sir Alexander Maxwell in the above-mentioned letter (1941-04-21):
# [N]o official designation has as far as I know been adopted for the time
# which is to be introduced in May....
# I cannot think of anything better than "Double British Summer Time"
# which could not be said to run counter to any official description.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Howse writes (p 157) 'DBST' too, but 'BDST' seems to have been common
# and follows the more usual convention of putting the location name first,
# so we use 'BDST'.

# Peter Ilieve (1998-04-19) described at length
# the history of summer time legislation in the United Kingdom.
# Since 1998 Joseph S. Myers has been updating
# and extending this list, which can be found in
# https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/

# From Joseph S. Myers (1998-01-06):
#
# The legal time in the UK outside of summer time is definitely GMT, not UTC;
# see Lord Tanlaw's speech
# https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo970611/text/70611-10.htm#70611-10_head0
# (Lords Hansard 11 June 1997 columns 964 to 976).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
#
# For lack of other data, follow Shanks & Pottenger for Eire in 1940-1948.
#
# Given Ilieve and Myers's data, the following claims by Shanks & Pottenger
# are incorrect:
#     * Wales did not switch from GMT to daylight saving time until
#	1921 Apr 3, when they began to conform with the rest of Great Britain.
# Actually, Wales was identical after 1880.
#     * Eire had two transitions on 1916 Oct 1.
# It actually just had one transition.
#     * Northern Ireland used single daylight saving time throughout WW II.
# Actually, it conformed to Britain.
#     * GB-Eire changed standard time to 1 hour ahead of GMT on 1968-02-18.
# Actually, that date saw the usual switch to summer time.
# Standard time was not changed until 1968-10-27 (the clocks didn't change).
#
# Here is another incorrect claim by Shanks & Pottenger:
#     * Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man did not switch from GMT
#	to daylight saving time until 1921 Apr 3, when they began to
#	conform with Great Britain.
# S.R.&O. 1916, No. 382 and HO 45/10811/312364 (quoted above) say otherwise.
#
# The following claim by Shanks & Pottenger is possible though doubtful;
# we'll ignore it for now.
#     * Dublin's 1971-10-31 switch was at 02:00, even though London's was 03:00.

# From Paul Eggert (2017-12-04):
#
# Dunsink Observatory (8 km NW of Dublin's center) was to Dublin as
# Greenwich was to London.  For example:
#
#   "Timeball on the ballast office is down.  Dunsink time."
#   -- James Joyce, Ulysses
#
# The abbreviation DMT stood for "Dublin Mean Time" or "Dunsink Mean Time";
# this being Ireland, opinions differed.
#
# Whitman says Dublin/Dunsink Mean Time was UT-00:25:21, which agrees
# with measurements of recent visitors to the Meridian Room of Dunsink
# Observatory; see Malone D. Dunsink and timekeeping. 2016-01-24.
# <https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwmalone/time/dunsink.html>.  Malone
# writes that the Nautical Almanac listed UT-00:25:22 until 1896, when
# it moved to UT-00:25:21.1 (I confirmed that the 1893 edition used
# the former and the 1896 edition used the latter).  Evidently the
# news of this change propagated slowly, as Milne 1899 still lists
# UT-00:25:22 and cites the International Telegraph Bureau.  As it is
# not clear that there was any practical significance to the change
# from UT-00:25:22 to UT-00:25:21.1 in civil timekeeping, omit this
# transition for now and just use the latter value, omitting its
# fraction since our format cannot represent fractions.

# "Countess Markievicz ... claimed that the [1916] abolition of Dublin Mean Time
# was among various actions undertaken by the 'English' government that
# would 'put the whole country into the SF (Sinn Féin) camp'.  She claimed
# Irish 'public feeling (was) outraged by forcing of English time on us'."
# -- Parsons M. Dublin lost its time zone - and 25 minutes - after 1916 Rising.

#
# (These are those I found, but there could be more.  In any case these
# should allow various updates to the comments in the europe file to cover
# the laws applicable in Ireland.)
#
# (Note that the time in the Republic of Ireland since 1968 has been defined
# in terms of standard time being GMT+1 with a period of winter time when it
# is GMT, rather than standard time being GMT with a period of summer time
# being GMT+1.)

# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-28):
# Clive Feather (<news:859845706.26043.0@office.demon.net>, 1997-03-31)
# reports that Folkestone (Cheriton) Shuttle Terminal uses Concession Time
# (CT), equivalent to French civil time.
# Julian Hill (<news:36118128.5A14@virgin.net>, 1998-09-30) reports that
# trains between Dollands Moor (the freight facility next door)
# and Frethun run in CT.
# My admittedly uninformed guess is that the terminal has two authorities,
# the French concession operators and the British civil authorities,
# and that the time depends on who you're talking to.
# If, say, the British police were called to the station for some reason,
# I would expect the official police report to use GMT/BST and not CET/CEST.
# This is a borderline case, but for now let's stick to GMT/BST.

# From an anonymous contributor (1996-06-02):
# The law governing time in Ireland is under Statutory Instrument SI 395/94,
# which gives force to European Union 7th Council Directive No. 94/21/EC.
# Under this directive, the Minister for Justice in Ireland makes appropriate
# regulations. I spoke this morning with the Secretary of the Department of
# Justice (tel +353 1 678 9711) who confirmed to me that the correct name is
# "Irish Summer Time", abbreviated to "IST".
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-12-07):
# The 1996 anonymous contributor's goal was to determine the correct
# abbreviation for summer time in Dublin and so the contributor
# focused on the "IST", not on the "Irish Summer Time".  Though the
# "IST" was correct, the "Irish Summer Time" appears to have been an
# error, as Ireland's Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971 states that
# standard time in Ireland remains at UT +01 and is observed in
# summer, and that Greenwich mean time is observed in winter.  (Thanks
# to Derick Rethans for pointing out the error.)  That is, when
# Ireland amended the 1968 act that established UT +01 as Irish
# Standard Time, it left standard time unchanged and established GMT
# as a negative daylight saving time in winter.  So, in this database
# IST stands for Irish Summer Time for timestamps before 1968, and for
# Irish Standard Time after that.  See:

# From Paul Eggert (2018-02-15):
# In January 2018 we discovered that the negative SAVE values in the
# Eire rules cause problems with tests for ICU:
# https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025825.html
# and with tests for OpenJDK:
# https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025822.html
#
# To work around this problem, the build procedure can translate the
# following data into two forms, one with negative SAVE values and the
# other form with a traditional approximation for Irish timestamps
# after 1971-10-31 02:00 UTC; although this approximation has tm_isdst
# flags that are reversed, its UTC offsets are correct and this often
# suffices.  This source file currently uses only nonnegative SAVE
# values, but this is intended to change and downstream code should
# not rely on it.
#
# The following is like GB-Eire and EU, except with standard time in
# summer and negative daylight saving time in winter.  It is for when
# negative SAVE values are used.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-07-13):
#
# I found what is probably a typo of 2:00 which should perhaps be 2:00s
# in the C-Eur rule from tz database version 2008d (this part was
# corrected in version 2008d). The circumstantial evidence is simply the
# tz database itself, as seen below:
#

#
# It seems that Paris, Monaco, Rule France, Rule Belgium all agree on
# 2:00 standard time, e.g. 3:00 local time.  However there are no
# countries that use C-Eur rules in September 1945, so the only items
# affected are apparently these fictitious zones that translate acronyms

# Council of Ministers of the USSR from 1989-03-14 No. 227.
#
# I did not find full texts of these acts.  For the 1989 one we have
# title at https://base.garant.ru/70754136/ :
# "About change in calculation of time on the territories of
# Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR and Estonian SSR, Astrakhan,
# Kaliningrad, Kirov, Kuybyshev, Ulyanovsk and Uralsk oblasts".
# And http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt appears to
# contain quotes from both acts: Since last Sunday of March 1988 rules
# of the second time belt are installed in Volgograd and Saratov
# oblasts.  Since last Sunday of March 1989:
# a) Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR, Estonian SSR, Kaliningrad oblast:
# second time belt rules without extra hour (Moscow-1);
# b) Astrakhan, Kirov, Kuybyshev, Ulyanovsk oblasts: second time belt
# rules (Moscow time)
# c) Uralsk oblast: third time belt rules (Moscow+1).

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-27):
# Unamended version of the act of the
# Government of the Russian Federation No. 23 from 08.01.1992
# http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&nd=102014034&rdk=0
# says that every year clocks were to be moved forward on last Sunday
# of March at 2 hours and moved backwards on last Sunday of September
# at 3 hours.  It was amended in 1996 to replace September with October.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-06-14):
# According to Kremlin press service, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
# signed a federal law "On calculation of time" on June 9, 2011.
# According to the law Russia is abolishing daylight saving time.

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-06-15):
# Take "abolishing daylight saving time" to mean that time is now considered
# to be standard.

# These are for backward compatibility with older versions.

# Previous editions of this database used abbreviations like MET DST

#	Mitteleuropäische Zeit (MEZ)         = UTC+01:00
#	Mitteleuropäische Sommerzeit (MESZ)  = UTC+02:00
#
# as defined in the German Time Act (Gesetz über die Zeitbestimmung (ZeitG),
# 1978-07-25, Bundesgesetzblatt, Jahrgang 1978, Teil I, S. 1110-1111)....

# ... I received today an answer letter from Dr. Peter Hetzel, head of the PTB
# department for time and frequency transmission.  He explained that the
# PTB translates MEZ and MESZ into English as
#
#	Central European Time (CET)         = UTC+01:00

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2005-04-26):
# http://www.hum.aau.dk/~poe/tid/tine/DanskTid.htm says that the law
# [introducing standard time] was in effect from 1894-01-01....
# The page http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A18930008330-REGL
# confirms this, and states that the law was put forth 1893-03-29.
#
# The EU [actually, EEC and Euratom] treaty with effect from 1973:
# http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A19722110030-REGL
#
# This provoked a new law from 1974 to make possible summer time changes
# in subsequent decrees with the law
# http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A19740022330-REGL
#
# It seems however that no decree was set forward until 1980.  I have
# not found any decree, but in another related law, the effecting DST
# changes are stated explicitly to be from 1980-04-06 at 02:00 to
# 1980-09-28 at 02:00.  If this is true, this differs slightly from
# the EU rule in that DST runs to 02:00, not 03:00.  We don't know
# when Denmark began using the EU rule correctly, but we have only
# confirmation of the 1980-time, so I presume it was correct in 1981:
# The law is about the management of the extra hour, concerning
# working hours reported and effect on obligatory-rest rules (which
# was suspended on that night):
# http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/C19801120554-REGL

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2005-06-11):
# The Herning Folkeblad (1980-09-26) reported that the night between
# Saturday and Sunday the clock is set back from three to two.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-06-11):
# Hence the "02:00" of the 1980 law refers to standard time, not
# wall-clock time, and so the EU rules were in effect in 1980.

# From Paul Eggert (2004-10-31):
# During World War II, Germany maintained secret manned weather stations in

# My source for this is Wilhelm Dege's book mentioned under Svalbard.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-12-10):
# Greenland joined the European Communities as part of Denmark,
# obtained home rule on 1979-05-01, and left the European Communities
# on 1985-02-01.  It therefore should have been using EU
# rules at least through 1984.  Shanks & Pottenger say Scoresbysund and Godthåb
# used C-Eur rules after 1980, but IATA SSIM (1991/1996) says they use EU
# rules since at least 1991.  Assume EU rules since 1980.

# From Gwillim Law (2001-06-06), citing
# <http://www.statkart.no/efs/efshefter/2001/efs5-2001.pdf> (2001-03-15),
# and with translations corrected by Steffen Thorsen:
#
# Greenland has four local times, and the relation to UTC
# is according to the following time line:
#
# The military zone near Thule	UTC-4
# Standard Greenland time	UTC-3
# Scoresbysund			UTC-1
# Danmarkshavn			UTC
#
# In the military area near Thule and in Danmarkshavn DST will not be
# introduced.

# From Rives McDow (2001-11-01):
#
# I correspond regularly with the Dansk Polarcenter, and wrote them at
# the time to clarify the situation in Thule.  Unfortunately, I have
# not heard back from them regarding my recent letter.  [But I have
# info from earlier correspondence.]
#
# According to the center, a very small local time zone around Thule
# Air Base keeps the time according to UTC-4, implementing daylight
# savings using North America rules, changing the time at 02:00 local time....
#
# The east coast of Greenland north of the community of Scoresbysund
# uses UTC in the same way as in Iceland, year round, with no dst.
# There are just a few stations on this coast, including the
# Danmarkshavn ICAO weather station mentioned in your September 29th
# email.  The other stations are two sledge patrol stations in
# Mestersvig and Daneborg, the air force base at Station Nord, and the
# DPC research station at Zackenberg.
#
# Scoresbysund and two small villages nearby keep time UTC-1 and use
# the same daylight savings time period as in West Greenland (Godthåb).
#
# The rest of Greenland, including Godthåb (this area, although it
# includes central Greenland, is known as west Greenland), keeps time
# UTC-3, with daylight savings methods according to European rules.
#
# It is common procedure to use UTC 0 in the wilderness of East and
# North Greenland, because it is mainly Icelandic aircraft operators
# maintaining traffic in these areas.  However, the official status of
# this area is that it sticks with Godthåb time.  This area might be
# considered a dual time zone in some respects because of this.

# From Rives McDow (2001-11-19):
# I heard back from someone stationed at Thule; the time change took place
# there at 2:00 AM.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# From 1997 on the CIA map shows Danmarkshavn on GMT;
# the 1995 map as like Godthåb.
# For lack of better info, assume they were like Godthåb before 1996.
# startkart.no says Thule does not observe DST, but this is clearly an error,
# so go with Shanks & Pottenger for Thule transitions until this year.
# For 2007 on assume Thule will stay in sync with US DST rules.

# From J William Piggott (2016-02-20):
# "Greenland north of the community of Scoresbysund" is officially named
# "National Park" by Executive Order:
# http://naalakkersuisut.gl/~/media/Nanoq/Files/Attached%20Files/Engelske-tekster/Legislation/Executive%20Order%20National%20Park.rtf
# It is their only National Park.

# http://trip.rk.ee/cgi-bin/thw?${BASE}=akt&${OOHTML}=rtd&TA=1998&TO=1&AN=1390
# refers to the Eighth Directive and cites the association agreement between
# the EU and Estonia, ratified by the Estonian law (RT II 1995, 22-27, 120).
#
# I also asked [my relative] whether they use any standard abbreviation
# for their standard and summer times. He says no, they use "suveaeg"
# (summer time) and "talveaeg" (winter time).

# From The Baltic Times <https://www.baltictimes.com/> (1999-09-09)
# via Steffen Thorsen:
# This year will mark the last time Estonia shifts to summer time,
# a council of the ruling coalition announced Sept. 6....
# But what this could mean for Estonia's chances of joining the European
# Union are still unclear.  In 1994, the EU declared summer time compulsory
# for all member states until 2001.  Brussels has yet to decide what to do
# after that.

# From Mart Oruaas (2000-01-29):
# Regulation No. 301 (1999-10-12) obsoletes previous regulation
# No. 206 (1998-09-22) and thus sticks Estonia to +02:00 GMT for all
# the year round.  The regulation is effective 1999-11-01.

# From Toomas Soome (2002-02-21):
# The Estonian government has changed once again timezone politics.
# Now we are using again EU rules.
#
# From Urmet Jänes (2002-03-28):
# The legislative reference is Government decree No. 84 on 2002-02-21.

# Finland

# From Hannu Strang (1994-09-25 06:03:37 UTC):
# Well, here in Helsinki we're just changing from summer time to regular one,
# and it's supposed to change at 4am...

# From Janne Snabb (2010-07-15):
#
# I noticed that the Finland data is not accurate for years 1981 and 1982.
# During these two first trial years the DST adjustment was made one hour
# earlier than in forthcoming years. Starting 1983 the adjustment was made
# according to the central European standards.
#
# This is documented in Heikki Oja: Aikakirja 2007, published by The Almanac
# Office of University of Helsinki, ISBN 952-10-3221-9, available online (in
# Finnish) at
# https://almanakka.helsinki.fi/aikakirja/Aikakirja2007kokonaan.pdf
#
# Page 105 (56 in PDF version) has a handy table of all past daylight savings
# transitions. It is easy enough to interpret without Finnish skills.
#
# This is also confirmed by Finnish Broadcasting Company's archive at:
# http://www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/?s=s&g=1&ag=5&t=&a=3401
#
# The news clip from 1981 says that "the time between 2 and 3 o'clock does not
# exist tonight."

# From Konstantin Hyppönen (2014-06-13):
# [Heikki Oja's book Aikakirja 2013]
# https://almanakka.helsinki.fi/images/aikakirja/Aikakirja2013kokonaan.pdf
# pages 104-105, including a scan from a newspaper published on Apr 2 1942
# say that ... [o]n Apr 2 1942, 24 o'clock (which means Apr 3 1942,

# On Oct 4 1942, clocks were moved at 1:00 one hour backwards.

# Iceland
#
# From Adam David (1993-11-06):
# The name of the timezone in Iceland for system / mail / news purposes is GMT.
#
# (1993-12-05):
# This material is paraphrased from the 1988 edition of the University of
# Iceland Almanak.
#
# From January 1st, 1908 the whole of Iceland was standardised at 1 hour
# behind GMT. Previously, local mean solar time was used in different parts
# of Iceland, the almanak had been based on Reykjavik mean solar time which
# was 1 hour and 28 minutes behind GMT.
#
# "first day of winter" referred to [below] means the first day of the 26 weeks
# of winter, according to the old icelandic calendar that dates back to the
# time the norsemen first settled Iceland.  The first day of winter is always
# Saturday, but is not dependent on the Julian or Gregorian calendars.
#
# (1993-12-10):
# I have a reference from the Oxford Icelandic-English dictionary for the
# beginning of winter, which ties it to the ecclesiastical calendar (and thus
# to the julian/gregorian calendar) over the period in question.
#	the winter begins on the Saturday next before St. Luke's day
#	(old style), or on St. Luke's day, if a Saturday.
# St. Luke's day ought to be traceable from ecclesiastical sources. "old style"
# might be a reference to the Julian calendar as opposed to Gregorian, or it
# might mean something else (???).

# Italy
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Sicily and Sardinia each had their own time zones from 1866 to 1893,
# called Palermo Time (+00:53:28) and Cagliari Time (+00:36:32).
# During World War II, German-controlled Italy used German time.
# But these events all occurred before the 1970 cutoff,
# so record only the time in Rome.
#
# From Michael Deckers (2016-10-24):
# http://www.ac-ilsestante.it/MERIDIANE/ora_legale quotes a law of 1893-08-10
# ... [translated as] "The preceding dispositions will enter into
# force at the instant at which, according to the time specified in
# the 1st article, the 1st of November 1893 will begin...."
#
# From Pierpaolo Bernardi (2016-10-20):
# The authoritative source for time in Italy is the national metrological
# institute, which has a summary page of historical DST data at
# http://www.inrim.it/res/tf/ora_legale_i.shtml
# (2016-10-24):
# http://www.renzobaldini.it/le-ore-legali-in-italia/
# has still different data for 1944.  It divides Italy in two, as
# there were effectively two governments at the time, north of Gothic
# Line German controlled territory, official government RSI, and south
# of the Gothic Line, controlled by allied armies.
#
# From Brian Inglis (2016-10-23):
# Viceregal LEGISLATIVE DECREE. 14 September 1944, no. 219.
# Restoration of Standard Time. (044U0219) (OJ 62 of 30.9.1944) ...
# Given the R. law decreed on 1944-03-29, no. 92, by which standard time is
# advanced to sixty minutes later starting at hour two on 1944-04-02; ...
# Starting at hour three on the date 1944-09-17 standard time will be resumed.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2016-10-27):
# Go with INRiM for DST rules, except as corrected by Inglis for 1944
# for the Kingdom of Italy.  This is consistent with Renzo Baldini.
# Model Rome's occupation by using C-Eur rules from 1943-09-10
# to 1944-06-04; although Rome was an open city during this period, it
# was effectively controlled by Germany.

# Latvia

# From Liene Kanepe (1998-09-17):

# I asked about this matter Scientific Secretary of the Institute of Astronomy
# of The University of Latvia Dr. paed Mr. Ilgonis Vilks. I also searched the
# correct data in juridical acts and I found some juridical documents about
# changes in the counting of time in Latvia from 1981....
#
# Act No. 35 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1981-01-22 ...
# according to the Act No. 925 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1980-10-24
# ...: all year round the time of 2nd time zone + 1 hour, in addition turning
# the hands of the clock 1 hour forward on 1 April at 00:00 (GMT 31 March 21:00)
# and 1 hour backward on the 1 October at 00:00 (GMT 30 September 20:00).
#
# Act No. 592 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1984-09-24 ...
# according to the Act No. 967 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1984-09-13
# ...: all year round the time of 2nd time zone + 1 hour, in addition turning
# the hands of the clock 1 hour forward on the last Sunday of March at 02:00
# (GMT 23:00 on the previous day) and 1 hour backward on the last Sunday of
# September at 03:00 (GMT 23:00 on the previous day).
#
# Act No. 81 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1989-03-22 ...
# according to the Act No. 227 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1989-03-14
# ...: since the last Sunday of March 1989 in Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR,
# Estonian SSR and Kaliningrad region of Russian Federation all year round the
# time of 2nd time zone (Moscow time minus one hour). On the territory of Latvia
# transition to summer time is performed on the last Sunday of March at 02:00
# (GMT 00:00), turning the hands of the clock 1 hour forward.  The end of
# daylight saving time is performed on the last Sunday of September at 03:00
# (GMT 00:00), turning the hands of the clock 1 hour backward. Exception is
# 1989-03-26, when we must not turn the hands of the clock....
#
# The Regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia of
# 1997-01-21 on transition to Summer time ... established the same order of
# daylight savings time settings as in the States of the European Union.

# From Andrei Ivanov (2000-03-06):
# This year Latvia will not switch to Daylight Savings Time (as specified in
# The Regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Rep. of Latvia of
# 29-Feb-2000 (No. 79) <http://www.lv-laiks.lv/wwwraksti/2000/071072/vd4.htm>,
# in Latvian for subscribers only).

# From RFE/RL Newsline
# http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2001/01/3-CEE/cee-030101.html
# (2001-01-03), noted after a heads-up by Rives McDow:
# The Latvian government on 2 January decided that the country will
# institute daylight-saving time this spring, LETA reported.
# Last February the three Baltic states decided not to turn back their
# clocks one hour in the spring....
# Minister of Economy Aigars Kalvītis noted that Latvia had too few
# daylight hours and thus decided to comply with a draft European
# Commission directive that provides for instituting daylight-saving
# time in EU countries between 2002 and 2006. The Latvian government
# urged Lithuania and Estonia to adopt a similar time policy, but it
# appears that they will not do so....

# I ... translate only the last two paragraphs:
#    ... during second world war, in the years 1941 and 1942, Liechtenstein
#    introduced daylight saving time, adapting to Switzerland.  From 1943 on
#    central European time was in force throughout the year.
#    From a report of the duke's government to the high council,
#    regarding the introduction of a time law, of 31 May 1977.

# Lithuania

# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):
# The 1989 transition is from USSR act No. 227 (1989-03-14).

# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):
# IATA SSIM (1992/1996) says Lithuania uses W-Eur rules, but since it is
# known to be wrong about Estonia and Latvia, assume it's wrong here too.

# From Marius Gedminas (1998-08-07):
# I would like to inform that in this year Lithuanian time zone
# (Europe/Vilnius) was changed.

# From ELTA No. 972 (2582) (1999-09-29) <http://www.elta.lt/>,
# via Steffen Thorsen:
# Lithuania has shifted back to the second time zone (GMT plus two hours)
# to be valid here starting from October 31,
# as decided by the national government on Wednesday....
# The Lithuanian government also announced plans to consider a
# motion to give up shifting to summer time in spring, as it was
# already done by Estonia.

# From the Fact File, Lithuanian State Department of Tourism
# <http://www.tourism.lt/informa/ff.htm> (2000-03-27):
# Local time is GMT+2 hours ..., no daylight saving.

# From a user via Klaus Marten (2003-02-07):
# As a candidate for membership of the European Union, Lithuania will
# observe Summer Time in 2003, changing its clocks at the times laid
# down in EU Directive 2000/84 of 19.I.01 (i.e. at the same times as its

# Moldova

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-07):
# the act of the government of the Republic of Moldova Nr. 132 from 1990-05-04
# http://lex.justice.md/viewdoc.php?action=view&view=doc&id=298782&lang=2
# ... says that since 1990-05-06 on the territory of the Moldavian SSR
# time would be calculated as the standard time of the second time belt
# plus one hour of the "summer" time. To implement that clocks would be
# adjusted one hour backwards at 1990-05-06 2:00. After that "summer"
# time would be cancelled last Sunday of September at 3:00 and
# reintroduced last Sunday of March at 2:00.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# A previous version of this database followed Shanks & Pottenger, who write
# that Tiraspol switched to Moscow time on 1992-01-19 at 02:00.
# However, this is most likely an error, as Moldova declared independence
# on 1991-08-27 (the 1992-01-19 date is that of a Russian decree).
# In early 1992 there was large-scale interethnic violence in the area
# and it's possible that some Russophones continued to observe Moscow time.
# But [two people] separately reported via
# Jesper Nørgaard that as of 2001-01-24 Tiraspol was like Chisinau.
# The Tiraspol entry has therefore been removed for now.
#
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-10-17):
# Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR, also known as
# "Pridnestrovie") has abolished seasonal clock change (no transition
# to the Winter Time).
#
# News (in Russian):

# http://www.allmoldova.com/moldova-news/1249064116.html
#
# The substance of this change (reinstatement of the Tiraspol entry)
# is from a patch from Petr Machata (2011-10-17)
#
# From Tim Parenti (2011-10-19)
# In addition, being situated at +4651+2938 would give Tiraspol
# a pre-1880 LMT offset of 1:58:32.
#
# (which agrees with the earlier entry that had been removed)
#
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-10-26)
# NO need to divide Moldova into two timezones at this point.
# As of today, Transnistria (Pridnestrovie)- Tiraspol reversed its own
# decision to abolish DST this winter.
# Following Moldova and neighboring Ukraine- Transnistria (Pridnestrovie)-
# Tiraspol will go back to winter time on October 30, 2011.
# News from Moldova (in russian):

# From Roman Tudos (2015-07-02):

# From Paul Eggert (2015-07-01):
# The abovementioned official link to IGO1445-868/2014 states that

# says the 2014-03-30 spring-forward transition was at 02:00 local time.
# Guess that since 1997 Moldova has switched one hour before the EU.

# Netherlands

# Howse writes that the Netherlands' railways used GMT between 1892 and 1940,
# but for other purposes the Netherlands used Amsterdam mean time.

# However, Robert H. van Gent writes (2001-04-01):
# Howse's statement is only correct up to 1909. From 1909-05-01 (00:00:00
# Amsterdam mean time) onwards, the whole of the Netherlands (including
# the Dutch railways) was required by law to observe Amsterdam mean time
# (19 minutes 32.13 seconds ahead of GMT). This had already been the
# common practice (except for the railways) for many decades but it was
# not until 1909 when the Dutch government finally defined this by law.
# On 1937-07-01 this was changed to 20 minutes (exactly) ahead of GMT and
# was generally known as Dutch Time ("Nederlandse Tijd").
#
# (2001-04-08):
# 1892-05-01 was the date when the Dutch railways were by law required to
# observe GMT while the remainder of the Netherlands adhered to the common
# practice of following Amsterdam mean time.
#
# (2001-04-09):
# In 1835 the authorities of the province of North Holland requested the
# municipal authorities of the towns and cities in the province to observe
# Amsterdam mean time but I do not know in how many cases this request was
# actually followed.
#
# From 1852 onwards the Dutch telegraph offices were by law required to
# observe Amsterdam mean time. As the time signals from the observatory of
# Leiden were also distributed by the telegraph system, I assume that most
# places linked up with the telegraph (and railway) system automatically
# adopted Amsterdam mean time.
#
# Although the early Dutch railway companies initially observed a variety
# of times, most of them had adopted Amsterdam mean time by 1858 but it
# was not until 1866 when they were all required by law to observe
# Amsterdam mean time.

# The data entries before 1945 are taken from

# Svalbard & Jan Mayen

# From Steffen Thorsen (2001-05-01):
# Although I could not find it explicitly, it seems that Jan Mayen and
# Svalbard have been using the same time as Norway at least since the
# time they were declared as parts of Norway.  Svalbard was declared
# as a part of Norway by law of 1925-07-17 no 11, section 4 and Jan
# Mayen by law of 1930-02-27 no 2, section 2. (From
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19250717-011.html> and
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19300227-002.html>).  The law/regulation
# for normal/standard time in Norway is from 1894-06-29 no 1 (came
# into operation on 1895-01-01) and Svalbard/Jan Mayen seem to be a
# part of this law since 1925/1930. (From
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-18940629-001.html>) I have not been
# able to find if Jan Mayen used a different time zone (e.g. -0100)
# before 1930. Jan Mayen has only been "inhabited" since 1921 by
# Norwegian meteorologists and maybe used the same time as Norway ever
# since 1921.  Svalbard (Arctic/Longyearbyen) has been inhabited since
# before 1895, and therefore probably changed the local time somewhere
# between 1895 and 1925 (inclusive).

# From Paul Eggert (2013-09-04):
#
# Actually, Jan Mayen was never occupied by Germany during World War II,
# so it must have diverged from Oslo time during the war, as Oslo was
# keeping Berlin time.
#
# <https://www.jan-mayen.no/history.htm> says that the meteorologists
# burned down their station in 1940 and left the island, but returned in
# 1941 with a small Norwegian garrison and continued operations despite
# frequent air attacks from Germans.  In 1943 the Americans established a
# radiolocating station on the island, called "Atlantic City".  Possibly
# the UT offset changed during the war, but I think it unlikely that
# Jan Mayen used German daylight-saving rules.
#
# Svalbard is more complicated, as it was raided in August 1941 by an
# Allied party that evacuated the civilian population to England (says
# <http://www.bartleby.com/65/sv/Svalbard.html>).  The Svalbard FAQ
# <http://www.svalbard.com/SvalbardFAQ.html> says that the Germans were
# expelled on 1942-05-14.  However, small parties of Germans did return,
# and according to Wilhelm Dege's book "War North of 80" (1954)
# http://www.ucalgary.ca/UofC/departments/UP/1-55238/1-55238-110-2.html
# the German armed forces at the Svalbard weather station code-named
# Haudegen did not surrender to the Allies until September 1945.
#
# All these events predate our cutoff date of 1970, so use Europe/Oslo
# for these regions.

# Portugal

# From Paul Eggert (2014-08-11), after a heads-up from Stephen Colebourne:
# According to a Portuguese decree (1911-05-26)
# https://dre.pt/application/dir/pdf1sdip/1911/05/12500/23132313.pdf
# Lisbon was at -0:36:44.68, but switched to GMT on 1912-01-01 at 00:00.
# Round the old offset to -0:36:45.  This agrees with Willett....
#
# From Michael Deckers (2018-02-15):
# article 5 [of the 1911 decree; Deckers's translation] ...:
# These dispositions shall enter into force at the instant at which,
# according to the 2nd article, the civil day January 1, 1912 begins,
# all clocks therefore having to be advanced or set back correspondingly ...

# From Rui Pedro Salgueiro (1992-11-12):
# Portugal has recently (September, 27) changed timezone
# (from WET to MET or CET) to harmonize with EEC.
#
# Martin Bruckmann (1996-02-29) reports via Peter Ilieve
# that Portugal is reverting to 0:00 by not moving its clocks this spring.
# The new Prime Minister was fed up with getting up in the dark in the winter.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-12):
# IATA SSIM (1991-09) reports several 1991-09 and 1992-09 transitions
# at 02:00u, not 01:00u.  Assume that these are typos.
# IATA SSIM (1991/1992) reports that the Azores were at -1:00.
# IATA SSIM (1993-02) says +0:00; later issues (through 1996-09) say -1:00.
# Guess that the Azores changed to EU rules in 1992 (since that's when Portugal
# harmonized with EU rules), and that they stayed +0:00 that winter.

# Based on last Russian Government Decree No. 725 on August 31, 2011
# (Government document
# http://www.government.ru/gov/results/16355/print/
# in Russian)
# there are few corrections have to be made for some Russian time zones...
# All updated Russian Time Zones were placed in table and translated to English

# They are in Cyrillic letters (presumably Russian).

# From Arthur David Olson (2012-05-09):
# Regarding the instant when clocks in time-zone-shifting parts of Russia
# changed in September 2011:
#
# One source is
# http://government.ru/gov/results/16355/
# which, according to translate.google.com, begins "Decree of August 31,
# 2011 No. 725" and contains no other dates or "effective date" information.
#
# Another source is
# https://rg.ru/2011/09/06/chas-zona-dok.html
# which, according to translate.google.com, begins "Resolution of the
# Government of the Russian Federation on August 31, 2011 N 725" and also
# contains "Date first official publication: September 6, 2011 Posted on:
# in the 'RG' - Federal Issue No. 5573 September 6, 2011" but which
# does not contain any "effective date" information.
#
# Another source is
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oymyakonsky_District#cite_note-RuTime-7
# which, in note 8, contains "Resolution No. 725 of August 31, 2011...
# Effective as of after 7 days following the day of the official publication"
# but which does not contain any reference to September 6, 2011.
#
# The Wikipedia article refers to
# http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=LAW;n=118896
# which seems to copy the text of the government.ru page.
#
# Tobias Conradi combines Wikipedia's
# "as of after 7 days following the day of the official publication"
# with www.rg.ru's "Date of first official publication: September 6, 2011" to

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Moscow time zone abbreviations after 1919-07-01, and Moscow rules after 1991,
# are from Andrey A. Chernov.  The rest is from Shanks & Pottenger,
# except we follow Chernov's report that 1992 DST transitions were Sat
# 23:00, not Sun 02:00s.
#
# From Stanislaw A. Kuzikowski (1994-06-29):
# But now it is some months since Novosibirsk is 3 hours ahead of Moscow!
# I do not know why they have decided to make this change;
# as far as I remember it was done exactly during winter->summer switching
# so we (Novosibirsk) simply did not switch.
#
# From Andrey A. Chernov (1996-10-04):
# 'MSK' and 'MSD' were born and used initially on Moscow computers with
# UNIX-like OSes by several developer groups (e.g. Demos group, Kiae group)....
# The next step was the UUCP network, the Relcom predecessor
# (used mainly for mail), and MSK/MSD was actively used there.
#
# From Chris Carrier (1996-10-30):
# According to a friend of mine who rode the Trans-Siberian Railroad from
# Moscow to Irkutsk in 1995, public air and rail transport in Russia ...
# still follows Moscow time, no matter where in Russia it is located.
#
# For Grozny, Chechnya, we have the following story from
# John Daniszewski, "Scavengers in the Rubble", Los Angeles Times (2001-02-07):
# News - often false - is spread by word of mouth.  A rumor that it was
# time to move the clocks back put this whole city out of sync with
# the rest of Russia for two weeks - even soldiers stationed here began
# enforcing curfew at the wrong time.
#
# From Gwillim Law (2001-06-05):
# There's considerable evidence that Sakhalin Island used to be in
# UTC+11, and has changed to UTC+10, in this decade.  I start with the
# SSIM, which listed Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in zone RU10 along with Magadan
# until February 1997, and then in RU9 with Khabarovsk and Vladivostok
# since September 1997....  Although the Kuril Islands are
# administratively part of Sakhalin oblast', they appear to have
# remained on UTC+11 along with Magadan.

# This book looks like it would be a helpful resource for the Soviet
# Union through 1956.  Although a copy was in the Scientific Library
# of Tomsk State University, I have not been able to track down a copy nearby.

# http://astro.uni-altai.ru/~orion/blog/2015/05/center-reforma-ischisleniya-vremeni-br-na-territorii-sssr-v-1957-godu-center/
# says that the 1956 decision to change time belts' borders was not
# implemented as planned in 1956 and the change happened in 1957.
# There is also the problem that actual time zones were different from
# the official time belts (and from many time belts' maps) as there were
# numerous exceptions to application of time belt rules.  For example,
# https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Московское_время#Перемещение_границы_применения_московского_времени_на_восток
# says that by 1962 there were many regions in the 3rd time belt that
# were on Moscow time, referring to a 1962 map.  By 1989 number of such
# exceptions grew considerably.

# From Tim Parenti (2014-07-06):
# The comments detailing the coverage of each Russian zone are meant to assist
# with maintenance only and represent our best guesses as to which regions
# are covered by each zone.  They are not meant to be taken as an authoritative
# listing.  The region codes listed come from

# The Soviets switched to UT-based time in 1919.  Decree No. 59
# (1919-02-08) http://istmat.info/node/35567 established UT-based time
# zones, and Decree No. 147 (1919-03-29) http://istmat.info/node/35854
# specified a transition date of 1919-07-01, apparently at 00:00 UT.
# No doubt only the Soviet-controlled regions switched on that date;
# later transitions to UT-based time in other parts of Russia are
# taken from what appear to be guesses by Shanks.
# (Thanks to Alexander Belopolsky for pointers to the decrees.)

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-07):
# 11. Regions-violators, 1981-1982.
# Wikipedia refers to
# http://maps.monetonos.ru/maps/raznoe/Old_Maps/Old_Maps/Articles/022/3_1981.html
# http://besp.narod.ru/nauka_1981_3.htm
#
# The second link provides two articles scanned from the Nauka i Zhizn
# magazine No. 3, 1981 and a scan of the short article attributed to
# the Trud newspaper from February 1982.  The first link provides the
# same Nauka i Zhizn articles converted to the text form (but misses
# time belt changes map).
#
# The second Nauka i Zhizn article says that in addition to
# introduction of summer time on 1981-04-01 there are some time belt
# border changes on 1981-10-01, mostly affecting Nenets Autonomous
# Okrug, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Yakutia, Magadan Oblast and Chukotka
# according to the provided map (colored one).  In addition to that
# "time violators" (regions which were not using rules of the time
# belts in which they were located) would not be moving off the DST on
# 1981-10-01 to restore the decree time usage.  (Komi ASSR was
# supposed to repeat that move in October 1982 to account for the 2
# hour difference.)  Map depicting "time violators" before 1981-10-01
# is also provided.
#
# The article from Trud says that 1981-10-01 changes caused problems
# and some territories would be moved to pre-1981-10-01 time by not
# moving to summer time on 1982-04-01.  Namely: Dagestan,
# Kabardino-Balkar, Kalmyk, Komi, Mari, Mordovian, North Ossetian,
# Tatar, Chechen-Ingush and Chuvash ASSR, Krasnodar and Stavropol
# krais, Arkhangelsk, Vladimir, Vologda, Voronezh, Gorky, Ivanovo,
# Kostroma, Lipetsk, Penza, Rostov, Ryazan, Tambov, Tyumen and
# Yaroslavl oblasts, Nenets and Evenk autonomous okrugs, Khatangsky
# district of Taymyr Autonomous Okrug.  As a result Evenk Autonomous
# Okrug and Khatangsky district of Taymyr Autonomous Okrug would end
# up on Moscow+4, Tyumen Oblast on Moscow+2 and the rest on Moscow
# time.
#
# http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt
# attributes the 1982 changes to the Act of the Council of Ministers
# of the USSR No. 126 from 18.02.1982.  1980-925.txt also adds
# Udmurtia to the list of affected territories and lists Khatangsky
# district separately from Taymyr Autonomous Okrug.  Probably erroneously.
#
# The affected territories are currently listed under Europe/Moscow,
# Asia/Yekaterinburg and Asia/Krasnoyarsk.
#
# 12. Udmurtia
# The fact that Udmurtia is depicted as a violator in the Nauka i
# Zhizn article hints at Izhevsk being on different time from
# Kuybyshev before 1981-10-01. Udmurtia is not mentioned in the 1989 act.
# http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt
# implies Udmurtia was on Moscow time after 1982-04-01.
# Wikipedia implies Udmurtia being on Moscow+1 until 1991.
#
# ...
#
# All Russian zones are supposed to have by default a -1 change at
# 1991-03-31 2:00 (cancellation of the decree time in the USSR) and a +1
# change at 1992-01-19 2:00 (restoration of the decree time in Russia).
#
# There were some exceptions, though.
# Wikipedia says newspapers listed Astrakhan, Saratov, Kirov, Volgograd,
# Izhevsk, Grozny, Kazan and Samara as such exceptions for the 1992
# change. (Different newspapers providing different lists. And some
# lists found in the internet are quite wild.)
#
# And apparently some exceptions were reverted in the last moment.
# http://www.kaliningradka.ru/site_pc/cherez/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=40091
# says that Kaliningrad decided not to be an exception 2 days before the
# 1991-03-31 switch and one person at
# https://izhevsk.ru/forum_light_message/50/682597-m8369040.html
# says he remembers that Samara opted out of the 1992-01-19 exception
# 2 days before the switch.
#
#
# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):
# Given the above, we appear to be missing some Zone entries for the
# chaotic early 1980s in Russia.  It's not clear what these entries
# should be.  For now, sweep this under the rug and just document the
# time in Moscow.

# From Vladimir Karpinsky (2014-07-08):
# LMT in Moscow (before Jul 3, 1916) is 2:30:17, that was defined by Moscow
# Observatory (coordinates: 55° 45' 29.70", 37° 34' 05.30")....
# LMT in Moscow since Jul 3, 1916 is 2:31:01 as a result of new standard.
# (The info is from the book by Byalokoz ... p. 18.)
# The time in St. Petersburg as capital of Russia was defined by
# Pulkov observatory, near St. Petersburg.  In 1916 LMT Moscow
# was synchronized with LMT St. Petersburg (+30 minutes), (Pulkov observatory
# coordinates: 59° 46' 18.70", 30° 19' 40.70") so 30° 19' 40.70" >
# 2h01m18.7s = 2:01:19.  LMT Moscow = LMT St.Petersburg + 30m 2:01:19 + 0:30 =

#
# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-08):
# Milne does not list Moscow, but suggests that its time might be listed in
# Résumés mensuels et annuels des observations météorologiques (1895).
# Presumably this is OCLC 85825704, a journal published with parallel text in
# Russian and French.  This source has not been located; go with Karpinsky.

# From Tim Parenti (2014-07-02):
# Oymyakonsky District of Sakha Republic (represented by Ust-Nera), along with
# most of Sakhalin Oblast (represented by Sakhalin) will be moving to UTC+10 on
# 2014-10-26 to stay aligned with VLAT/SAKT; however, Severo-Kurilsky District
# of the Sakhalin Oblast (also known as the North Kuril Islands, represented by

# From Tim Parenti (2014-07-06):
# Assume North Kuril Islands have history like Magadan before 2011-03-27.
# There is a decent chance this is wrong, in which case a new zone
# Asia/Severo-Kurilsk would become necessary.
#
# Srednekolymsk and Zyryanka are the most populous places amongst these
# districts, but have very similar populations.  In fact, Wikipedia currently
# lists them both as having 3528 people, exactly 1668 males and 1860 females

# Assume this is a mistake, albeit an amusing one.
#
# Looking at censuses, the populations of the two municipalities seem to have
# fluctuated recently.  Zyryanka was more populous than Srednekolymsk in the
# 1989 and 2002 censuses, but Srednekolymsk was more populous in the most
# recent (2010) census, 3525 to 3170.  (See pages 195 and 197 of

# in Russian.)  In addition, Srednekolymsk appears to be a much older
# settlement and the population of Zyryanka seems to be declining.

# From Paul Eggert (2016-12-14):
#
# The source for Europe/Madrid before 2013 is:
# Planesas P. La hora oficial en España y sus cambios.
# Anuario del Observatorio Astronómico de Madrid (2013, in Spanish).
# http://astronomia.ign.es/rknowsys-theme/images/webAstro/paginas/documentos/Anuario/lahoraoficialenespana.pdf
# As this source says that historical time in the Canaries is obscure,
# and it does not discuss Ceuta, stick with Shanks for now for that data.
#
# In the 1918 and 1919 fallback transitions in Spain, the clock for
# the hour-longer day officially kept going after midnight, so that
# the repeated instances of that day's 00:00 hour were 24 hours apart,
# with a fallback transition from the second occurrence of 00:59... to
# the next day's 00:00.  Our data format cannot represent this
# directly, and instead repeats the first hour of the next day, with a
# fallback transition from the next day's 00:59... to 00:00.

# From Michael Deckers (2016-12-15):
# The Royal Decree of 1900-06-26 quoted by Planesas, online at
# https://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1900/209/A00383-00384.pdf
# says in its article 5 (my translation):
# These dispositions will enter into force beginning with the
# instant at which, according to the time indicated in article 1,
# the 1st day of January of 1901 will begin.

# Sweden

# From Ivan Nilsson (2001-04-13), superseding Shanks & Pottenger:
#
# The law "Svensk författningssamling 1878, no 14" about standard time in 1879:
# From the beginning of 1879 (that is 01-01 00:00) the time for all
# places in the country is "the mean solar time for the meridian at
# three degrees, or twelve minutes of time, to the west of the
# meridian of the Observatory of Stockholm".  The law is dated 1878-05-31.
#
# The observatory at that time had the meridian 18° 03' 30"
# eastern longitude = 01:12:14 in time.  Less 12 minutes gives the
# national standard time as 01:00:14 ahead of GMT....
#
# About the beginning of CET in Sweden. The lawtext ("Svensk
# författningssamling 1899, no 44") states, that "from the beginning
# of 1900... ... the same as the mean solar time for the meridian at
# the distance of one hour of time from the meridian of the English
# observatory at Greenwich, or at 12 minutes 14 seconds to the west
# from the meridian of the Observatory of Stockholm". The law is dated
# 1899-06-16.  In short: At 1900-01-01 00:00:00 the new standard time
# in Sweden is 01:00:00 ahead of GMT.
#
# 1916: The lawtext ("Svensk författningssamling 1916, no 124") states
# that "1916-05-15 is considered to begin one hour earlier". It is
# pretty obvious that at 05-14 23:00 the clocks are set to 05-15 00:00....
# Further the law says, that "1916-09-30 is considered to end one hour later".
#
# The laws regulating [DST] are available on the site of the Swedish
# Parliament beginning with 1985 - the laws regulating 1980/1984 are
# not available on the site (to my knowledge they are only available
# in Swedish): <http://www.riksdagen.se/english/work/sfst.asp> (type
# "sommartid" without the quotes in the field "Fritext" and then click

#
# (2001-05-13):
#
# I have now found a newspaper stating that at 1916-10-01 01:00
# summertime the church-clocks etc were set back one hour to show
# 1916-10-01 00:00 standard time.  The article also reports that some
# people thought the switch to standard time would take place already
# at 1916-10-01 00:00 summer time, but they had to wait for another
# hour before the event took place.

# From Alois Treindl (2008-12-17):
# I have researched the DST usage in Switzerland during the 1940ies.
#
# As I wrote in an earlier message, I suspected the current tzdata values
# to be wrong. This is now verified.
#
# I have found copies of the original ruling by the Swiss Federal
# government, in 'Eidgenössische Gesetzessammlung 1941 and 1942' (Swiss
# federal law collection)...
#
# DST began on Monday 5 May 1941, 1:00 am by shifting the clocks to 2:00 am
# DST ended on Monday 6 Oct 1941, 2:00 am by shifting the clocks to 1:00 am.
#
# DST began on Monday, 4 May 1942 at 01:00 am
# DST ended on Monday, 5 Oct 1942 at 02:00 am
#
# There was no DST in 1940, I have checked the law collection carefully.
# It is also indicated by the fact that the 1942 entry in the law
# collection points back to 1941 as a reference, but no reference to any
# other years are made.
#
# Newspaper articles I have read in the archives on 6 May 1941 reported
# about the introduction of DST (Sommerzeit in German) during the previous
# night as an absolute novelty, because this was the first time that such
# a thing had happened in Switzerland.
#
# I have also checked 1916, because one book source (Gabriel, Traité de
# l'heure dans le monde) claims that Switzerland had DST in 1916. This is
# false, no official document could be found. Probably Gabriel got misled
# by references to Germany, which introduced DST in 1916 for the first time.
#
# The tzdata rules for Switzerland must be changed to:
# Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       May     Mon>=1  1:00    1:00    S
# Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       Oct     Mon>=1  2:00    0       -
#
# The 1940 rules must be deleted.
#
# One further detail for Switzerland, which is probably out of scope for
# most users of tzdata: The [Europe/Zurich zone] ...
# describes all of Switzerland correctly, with the exception of
# the Canton de Genève (Geneva, Genf). Between 1848 and 1894 Geneva did not
# follow Bern Mean Time but kept its own local mean time.
# To represent this, an extra zone would be needed.
#
# From Alois Treindl (2013-09-11):
# The Federal regulations say
# https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20071096/index.html
# ... the meridian for Bern mean time ... is 7° 26' 22.50".
# Expressed in time, it is 0h29m45.5s.

# From Pierre-Yves Berger (2013-09-11):
# the "Circulaire du conseil fédéral" (December 11 1893)
# http://www.amtsdruckschriften.bar.admin.ch/viewOrigDoc.do?id=10071353
# clearly states that the [1894-06-01] change should be done at midnight
# but if no one is present after 11 at night, could be postponed until one
# hour before the beginning of service.

# From Paul Eggert (2013-09-11):
# Round BMT to the nearest even second, 0:29:46.
#
# We can find no reliable source for Shanks's assertion that all of Switzerland
# except Geneva switched to Bern Mean Time at 00:00 on 1848-09-12.  This book:

#	ISBN 3-905311-68-2, OCLC 717570797.
#
# suggests that the transition was more gradual, and that the Swiss did not
# agree about civil time during the transition.  The timekeeping it gives the
# most detail for is postal and telegraph time: here, federal legislation (the
# "Bundesgesetz über die Erstellung von elektrischen Telegraphen") passed on
# 1851-11-23, and an official implementation notice was published 1853-07-16
# (Bundesblatt 1853, Bd. II, S. 859).  On p 72 Messerli writes that in
# practice since July 1853 Bernese time was used in "all postal and telegraph
# offices in Switzerland from Geneva to St. Gallen and Basel to Chiasso"
# (Google translation).  For now, model this transition as occurring on
# 1853-07-16, though it probably occurred at some other date in Zurich, and
# legal civil time probably changed at still some other transition date.

#
# From Igor Karpov, who works for the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice,
# via Garrett Wollman (2003-01-27):
# BTW, I've found the official document on this matter. It's government
# regulations No. 509, May 13, 1996. In my poor translation it says:
# "Time in Ukraine is set to second timezone (Kiev time). Each last Sunday
# of March at 3am the time is changing to 4am and each last Sunday of
# October the time at 4am is changing to 3am"

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-09-20):
# On September 20, 2011 the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada agreed to
# abolish the transfer clock to winter time.
#
# Bill No. 8330 of MP from the Party of Regions Oleg Nadoshi got
# approval from 266 deputies.

#
# From Philip Pizzey (2011-10-18):
# Today my Ukrainian colleagues have informed me that the
# Ukrainian parliament have decided that they will go to winter
# time this year after all.
#
# From Udo Schwedt (2011-10-18):
# As far as I understand, the recent change to the Ukrainian time zone
# (Europe/Kiev) to introduce permanent daylight saving time (similar
# to Russia) was reverted today:
# http://portal.rada.gov.ua/rada/control/en/publish/article/info_left?art_id=287324&cat_id=105995
#
# Also reported by Alexander Bokovoy (2011-10-18) who also noted:
# The law documents themselves are at
# http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb_n/webproc4_1?id=&pf3511=41484

# From Vladimir in Moscow via Alois Treindl re Kiev time 1991/2 (2014-02-28):
# First in Ukraine they changed Time zone from UTC+3 to UTC+2 with DST:
#       03 25 1990 02:00 -03.00 1       Time Zone 3 with DST
#       07 01 1990 02:00 -02.00 1       Time Zone 2 with DST
# * Ukrainian Government's Resolution of 18.06.1990, No. 134.
# http://search.ligazakon.ua/l_doc2.nsf/link1/T001500.html
#
# They did not end DST in September, 1990 (according to the law,
# "summer time" was still in action):
#       09 30 1990 03:00 -02.00 1       Time Zone 2 with DST
# * Ukrainian Government's Resolution of 21.09.1990, No. 272.
# http://search.ligazakon.ua/l_doc2.nsf/link1/KP900272.html
#
# Again no change in March, 1991 ("summer time" in action):
#       03 31 1991 02:00 -02.00 1       Time Zone 2 with DST
#
# DST ended in September 1991 ("summer time" ended):
#       09 29 1991 03:00 -02.00 0       Time Zone 2, no DST
# * Ukrainian Government's Resolution of 25.09.1991, No. 225.
# http://www.uazakon.com/documents/date_21/pg_iwgdoc.htm
# This is an answer.
#
# Since 1992 they had normal DST procedure:
#       03 29 1992 02:00 -02.00 1       DST started
#       09 27 1992 03:00 -02.00 0       DST ended
# * Ukrainian Government's Resolution of 20.03.1992, No. 139.
# http://www.uazakon.com/documents/date_8u/pg_grcasa.htm

# From Paul Eggert (2018-10-03):
# As is usual in tzdb, Ukrainian zones use the most common English spellings.
# For example, tzdb uses Europe/Kiev, as "Kiev" is the most common spelling in
# English for Ukraine's capital, even though it is certainly wrong as a
# transliteration of the Ukrainian "Київ".  This is similar to tzdb's use of
# Europe/Prague, which is certainly wrong as a transliteration of the Czech
# "Praha".  ("Kiev" came from old Slavic via Russian to English, and "Prague"
# came from old Slavic via French to English, so the two cases have something
# in common.)  Admittedly English-language spelling of Ukrainian names is
# controversial, and some day "Kyiv" may become substantially more popular in
# English; in the meantime, stick with the traditional English "Kiev" as that
# means less disruption for our users.
#
# Anyway, none of the common English-language spellings (Kiev, Kyiv, Kieff,
# Kijeff, Kijev, Kiyef, Kiyeff) do justice to the common pronunciation in
# Ukrainian, namely [ˈkɪjiu̯] (IPA).  This pronunciation has nothing like an
# English "v" or "f", and instead trails off with what an English-speaker
# would call a demure "oo" sound, and it would would be better anglicized as
# "Kuiyu".  Here's a sound file, if you would like to do as the Kuiyuvians do:

# One source shows that Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, and Greece observe DST from
# the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in September in 1986.
# The source shows Romania changing a day later than everybody else.
#
# According to Bernard Sieloff's source, Poland is in the MET time zone but
# uses the WE DST rules.  The Western USSR uses EET+1 and ME DST rules.
# Bernard Sieloff's source claims Romania switches on the same day, but at
# 00:00 standard time (i.e., 01:00 DST).  It also claims that Turkey
# switches on the same day, but switches on at 01:00 standard time
# and off at 00:00 standard time (i.e., 01:00 DST)

# ...the European time rules are...standardized since 1981, when
# most European countries started DST.  Before that year, only
# a few countries (UK, France, Italy) had DST, each according
# to own national rules.  In 1981, however, DST started on
# 'Apr firstSun', and not on 'Mar lastSun' as in the following
# years...
# But also since 1981 there are some more national exceptions
# than listed in 'europe': Switzerland, for example, joined DST
# one year later, Denmark ended DST on 'Oct 1' instead of 'Sep
# lastSun' in 1981 - I don't know how they handle now.
#
# Finally, DST ist always from 'Apr 1' to 'Oct 1' in the
# Soviet Union (as far as I know).

#
# The information from Tom Hofmann is (as far as I know) not entirely correct.
# After a request from chongo at amdahl I tried to retrieve all information
# about DST in Europe.  I was able to find all from about 1969.
#
# ...standardization on DST in Europe started in about 1977 with switches on
# first Sunday in April and last Sunday in September...
# In 1981 UK joined Europe insofar that
# the starting day for both shifted to last Sunday in March.  And from 1982
# the whole of Europe used DST, with switch dates April 1 and October 1 in
# the Sov[i]et Union.  In 1985 the SU reverted to standard Europe[a]n switch
# dates...
#
# It should also be remembered that time-zones are not constants; e.g.
# Portugal switched in 1976 from MET (or CET) to WET with DST...
# Note also that though there were rules for switch dates not
# all countries abided to these dates, and many individual deviations
# occurred, though not since 1982 I believe.  Another note: it is always
# assumed that DST is 1 hour ahead of normal time, this need not be the
# case; at least in the Netherlands there have been times when DST was 2 hours
# in advance of normal time.
