# This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of
# 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.

# From Paul Eggert (2018-05-27):
#
# Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
# Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
#
# Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
# for time zone data was the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
# IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
#
# Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
# Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
# I found in the UCLA library.
#
# For data circa 1899, a common source is:
# Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899 Feb;13(2):173-94.
# https://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359
#
# A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
# Derek Howse, Greenwich time and longitude, Philip Wilson Publishers (1997).
#
# European-style abbreviations are commonly used along the Mediterranean.
# For sub-Saharan Africa abbreviations were less standardized.
# Previous editions of this database used WAT, CAT, SAT, and EAT
# for UT +00 through +03, respectively,
# but in 1997 Mark R V Murray reported that
# 'SAST' is the official abbreviation for +02 in the country of South Africa,
# 'CAT' is commonly used for +02 in countries north of South Africa, and
# 'WAT' is probably the best name for +01, as the common phrase for
# the area that includes Nigeria is "West Africa".
#
# To summarize, the following abbreviations seemed to have some currency:
#	 +00	GMT	Greenwich Mean Time
#	 +02	CAT	Central Africa Time
#	 +02	SAST	South Africa Standard Time
# and Murray suggested the following abbreviation:
#	 +01	WAT	West Africa Time
# Murray's suggestion seems to have caught on in news reports and the like.
# I vaguely recall 'WAT' also being used for -01 in the past but
# cannot now come up with solid citations.
#
# I invented the following abbreviations in the 1990s:
#	 +02	WAST	West Africa Summer Time
#	 +03	CAST	Central Africa Summer Time
#	 +03	SAST	South Africa Summer Time
#	 +03	EAT	East Africa Time
# 'EAT' seems to have caught on and is in current timestamps, and though
# the other abbreviations are rarer and are only in past timestamps,
# they are paired with better-attested non-DST abbreviations.
# Corrections are welcome.

# From Abdelrahman Hassan (2007-09-06):
# Due to the Hijri (lunar Islamic calendar) year being 11 days shorter
# than the year of the Gregorian calendar, Ramadan shifts earlier each
# year. This year it will be observed September 13 (September is quite
# hot in Egypt), and the idea is to make fasting easier for workers by
# shifting business hours one hour out of daytime heat. Consequently,
# unless discontinued, next DST may end Thursday 28 August 2008.
# From Paul Eggert (2007-08-17):
# For lack of better info, assume the new rule is last Thursday in August.

#
# From Tim Parenti (2012-11-11):
# Treat the 2012-11-10 change as a zone change from UTC+2 to UTC+1.
# The DST rules planned for 2013 and onward roughly mirror those of Europe
# (either two days before them or five days after them, so as to fall on
# lastFri instead of lastSun).

# From Even Scharning (2013-10-25):
# The scheduled end of DST in Libya on Friday, October 25, 2013 was
# cancelled yesterday....

#
# From Paul Eggert (2013-10-25):
# For now, assume they're reverting to the pre-2012 rules of permanent UT +02.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-06-25):
# Mauritius plans to observe DST from 2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31 on a trial
# basis....
# It seems that Mauritius observed daylight saving time from 1982-10-10 to
# 1983-03-20 as well, but that was not successful....
# https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/mauritius-daylight-saving-time.html

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-06-30):
# The www.timeanddate.com article cited by Steffen Thorsen notes that "A
# final decision has yet to be made on the times that daylight saving
# would begin and end on these dates." As a place holder, use midnight.

# From Paul Eggert (2008-06-30):
# Follow Thorsen on DST in 1982/1983, instead of Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-07-10):
# According to
# http://www.lexpress.mu/display_article.php?news_id=111216
# (in French), Mauritius will start and end their DST a few days earlier
# than previously announced (2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31).  The new start
# date is 2008-10-26 at 02:00 and the new end date is 2009-03-27 (no time
# given, but it is probably at either 2 or 3 wall clock time).
#
# A little strange though, since the article says that they moved the date
# to align itself with Europe and USA which also change time on that date,
# but that means they have not paid attention to what happened in
# USA/Canada last year (DST ends first Sunday in November). I also wonder
# why that they end on a Friday, instead of aligning with Europe which
# changes two days later.

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-07-11):
# Seems that English language article "The revival of daylight saving
# time: Energy conservation?"- No. 16578 (07/11/2008) was originally
# published on Monday, June 30, 2008...
#
# I guess that article in French "Le gouvernement avance l'introduction
# de l'heure d'été" stating that DST in Mauritius starting on October 26
# and ending on March 27, 2009 is the most recent one....

# Cabinet Decision of July 18th, 2008 states as follows:
#
# 4. ...Cabinet has agreed to the introduction into the National Assembly
# of the Time Bill which provides for the introduction of summer time in
# Mauritius. The summer time period which will be of one hour ahead of
# the standard time, will be aligned with that in Europe and the United
# States of America. It will start at two o'clock in the morning on the
# last Sunday of October and will end at two o'clock in the morning on
# the last Sunday of March the following year. The summer time for the
# year 2008-2009 will, therefore, be effective as from 26 October 2008
# and end on 29 March 2009.

# Saturday night May 31st at midnight (which in French is to be

# Sunday night the 28th at midnight
#
# Seeing that the 28th is Monday, I am guessing that she intends to say

# From Arthur David Olson (2017-08-09):
# The text of the "Namibia Time Act, 1994" is available online at

# and includes this nugget:
# Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) of section 1, the
# first winter period after the commencement of this Act shall
# commence at OOhOO on Monday 21 March 1994 and shall end at 02h00 on
# Sunday 4 September 1994.

# From Michael Deckers (2017-04-06):
# ... both summer and winter time are called "standard"
# (which differs from the use in Ireland) ...

# From Petronella Sibeene (2007-03-30):
# http://allafrica.com/stories/200703300178.html
# While the entire country changes its time, Katima Mulilo and other
# settlements in Caprivi unofficially will not because the sun there
# rises and sets earlier compared to other regions.  Chief of
# Forecasting Riaan van Zyl explained that the far eastern parts of
# the country are close to 40 minutes earlier in sunrise than the rest
# of the country.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-02-22):
# Although the Zambezi Region (formerly known as Caprivi) informally
# observes Botswana time, we have no details about historical practice.
# In the meantime people there can use Africa/Gaborone.
# See: Immanuel S. The Namibian. 2017-02-23.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2017-08-09):
# Namibia is going to change their time zone to what is now their DST:
# https://www.newera.com.na/2017/02/23/namibias-winter-time-might-be-repealed/
# This video is from the government decision:
# https://www.nbc.na/news/na-passes-namibia-time-bill-repealing-1994-namibia-time-act.8665
# We have made the assumption so far that they will change their time zone at
# the same time they would normally start DST, the first Sunday in September:
# https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/namibia-new-time-zone.html

# From Paul Eggert (2017-04-09):
# Before the change, summer and winter time were both standard time legally.
# However in common parlance, winter time was considered to be DST.  See, e.g.:

# Tunisia

# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-30):
# My correspondent, Risto Nykänen, has alerted me to another adoption of DST,
# this time in Tunisia.  According to Yahoo France News
# <http://fr.news.yahoo.com/050426/5/4dumk.html>, in a story attributed to AP
# and dated 2005-04-26, "Tunisia has decided to advance its official time by
# one hour, starting on Sunday, May 1.  Henceforth, Tunisian time will be
# UTC+2 instead of UTC+1.  The change will take place at 23:00 UTC next
# Saturday."  (My translation)
#
# From Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-05-02):
# La Presse, the first national daily newspaper ...
# http://www.lapresse.tn/archives/archives280405/actualites/lheure.html
# ... DST for 2005: on: Sun May 1 0h standard time, off: Fri Sept. 30,
# 1h standard time.
#
# From Atef Loukil (2006-03-28):
# The daylight saving time will be the same each year:
# Beginning      : the last Sunday of March at 02:00
# Ending         : the last Sunday of October at 03:00 ...
# http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1188&Itemid=50

# From Steffen Thorsen (2009-03-16):
# According to several news sources, Tunisia will not observe DST this year.
# (Arabic)
# http://www.elbashayer.com/?page=viewn&nid=42546
# https://www.babnet.net/kiwidetail-15295.asp

# We have also confirmed this with the US embassy in Tunisia.
# We have a wrap-up about this on the following page:
# https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/tunisia-cancels-dst-2009.html

# http://www.tap.info.tn/ar/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=61240&Itemid=1

# From Arthur David Olson (2009-03-18):
# The Tunis Afrique Presse News Agency notice contains this: "This measure is
# due to the fact that the fasting month of Ramadan coincides with the period
# concerned by summer time.  Therefore, the standard time will be kept
# unchanged the whole year long."  So foregoing DST seems to be an exception
# (albeit one that may be repeated in the future).

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2010-03-27):
# According to some news reports Tunis confirmed not to use DST in 2010
#
# (translation):
# "The Tunisian government has decided to abandon DST, which was scheduled on
# Sunday...
# Tunisian authorities had suspended the DST for the first time last year also
# coincided with the month of Ramadan..."
