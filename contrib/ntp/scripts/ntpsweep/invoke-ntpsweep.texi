@code{ntpsweep}
prints per host the NTP stratum level, the clock offset in seconds, the daemon
version, the operating system and the processor. Optionally recursing through
all peers.

This section was generated by @strong{AutoGen},

@node ntpsweep usage
@subsection ntpsweep help/usage (@option{--help})
@cindex ntpsweep help

This is the automatically generated usage text for ntpsweep.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the @code{help} option
(@option{--help}) or the @code{more-help} option (@option{--more-help}).  @code{more-help} will print
the usage text by passing it through a pager program.
@code{more-help} is disabled on platforms without a working
@code{fork(2)} function.  The @code{PAGER} environment variable is
used to select the program, defaulting to @file{more}.  Both will exit
with a status code of 0.
