.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an SNMP MIB agent designed to interface with
.Xr ntpd @NTPD_MS@ .
.Sh "OPTIONS"
.Bl -tag
.It  Fl n , Fl \-nofork 
Do not fork.
.sp
.It  Fl p , Fl \-syslog 
Log to syslog().
.sp
.It  Fl \-agentxsocket  Ns = Ns Ar string 
The socket address ntpsnmpd uses to connect to net\-snmpd.
The default
.Ar string
for this option is:
.ti +4
 unix:/var/agentx/master
.sp
[<transport\-specifier>:]<transport\-address>
The default "agent X socket" is the Unix Domain socket
\fIunix:/var/agentx/master\fP.
Another common alternative is \fItcp:localhost:705\fP.
.It Fl \&? , Fl \-help
Display usage information and exit.
.It Fl \&! , Fl \-more\-help
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
.It Fl > Oo Ar cfgfile Oc , Fl \-save\-opts Oo Ns = Ns Ar cfgfile Oc
Save the option state to \fIcfgfile\fP.  The default is the \fIlast\fP
configuration file listed in the \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP section, below.
The command will exit after updating the config file.
.It Fl < Ar cfgfile , Fl \-load\-opts Ns = Ns Ar cfgfile , Fl \-no\-load\-opts
Load options from \fIcfgfile\fP.
The \fIno\-load\-opts\fP form will disable the loading
of earlier config/rc/ini files.  \fI\-\-no\-load\-opts\fP is handled early,
out of order.
.It Fl \-version Op Brq Ar v|c|n
Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple
version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will
print the full copyright notice.
.El
.Sh "OPTION PRESETS"
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s) and values from
environment variables named:
.nf
  \fBNTPSNMPD_<option\-name>\fP or \fBNTPSNMPD\fP
.fi
.ad
The environmental presets take precedence (are processed later than)
the configuration files.
The \fIhomerc\fP files are "\fI$HOME\fP", and "\fI.\fP".
If any of these are directories, then the file \fI.ntprc\fP
is searched for within those directories.
.Sh USAGE
.Nm
currently uses a private MIB OID,
.Ql enterprises.5597 ,
which is the Meinberg top level OEM OID, and
.Ql 99
is the temporary working space for this project. 
The final OID has to be registered with IANA
and this is done by the RFC Editor
when the NTPv4 MIB RFC is standardized. 
.Pp
If you have
.Xr snmpwalk 1
installed you can run
.Dl % snmpwalk \-v2c \-c public localhost enterprises.5597.99
to see a list of all currently supported NTP MIB objects
and their current values.
.Sh "ENVIRONMENT"
See \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP for configuration environment variables.
.Sh "FILES"
See \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP for configuration files.
.Sh "EXIT STATUS"

.It 1 " (EXIT_FAILURE)"
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
.It 66 " (EX_NOINPUT)"
