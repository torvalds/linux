.SH DESCRIPTION
This document describes the format of an NTP symmetric key file.
For a description of the use of this type of file, see the
"Authentication Support"
section of the
\fCntp.conf\f[]\fR(5)\f[]
page.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

\fCntpd\f[]\fR(8)\f[]
reads its keys from a file specified using the
\f\*[B-Font]\-k\f[]
command line option or the
\f\*[B-Font]keys\f[]
statement in the configuration file.
While key number 0 is fixed by the NTP standard
(as 56 zero bits)
and may not be changed,
one or more keys numbered between 1 and 65535
may be arbitrarily set in the keys file.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

The key file uses the same comment conventions
as the configuration file.
Key entries use a fixed format of the form
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

.in +4
\f\*[I-Font]keyno\f[] \f\*[I-Font]type\f[] \f\*[I-Font]key\f[] \f\*[I-Font]opt_IP_list\f[]
.in -4
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

where
\f\*[I-Font]keyno\f[]
is a positive integer (between 1 and 65535),
\f\*[I-Font]type\f[]
is the message digest algorithm,
\f\*[I-Font]key\f[]
is the key itself, and
\f\*[I-Font]opt_IP_list\f[]
is an optional comma-separated list of IPs
where the
\f\*[I-Font]keyno\f[]
should be trusted.
that are allowed to serve time.
Each IP in
\f\*[I-Font]opt_IP_list\f[]
may contain an optional
\f\*[B-Font]/subnetbits\f[]
specification which identifies the number of bits for
the desired subnet of trust.
If
\f\*[I-Font]opt_IP_list\f[]
is empty,
any properly-authenticated message will be
accepted.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

The
\f\*[I-Font]key\f[]
may be given in a format
controlled by the
\f\*[I-Font]type\f[]
field.
The
\f\*[I-Font]type\f[]
\f[C]MD5\f[]
is always supported.
If
\f[C]ntpd\f[]
was built with the OpenSSL library
then any digest library supported by that library may be specified.
However, if compliance with FIPS 140-2 is required the
\f\*[I-Font]type\f[]
must be either
\f[C]SHA\f[]
or
\f[C]SHA1\f[].
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

What follows are some key types, and corresponding formats:
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

.TP 7
.NOP \f[C]MD5\f[]
The key is 1 to 16 printable characters terminated by
an EOL,
whitespace,
or
a
\f[C]#\f[]
(which is the "start of comment" character).
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

.br
.ns
.TP 7
.NOP \f[C]SHA\f[]
.br
.ns
.TP 7
.NOP \f[C]SHA1\f[]
.br
.ns
.TP 7
.NOP \f[C]RMD160\f[]
The key is a hex-encoded ASCII string of 40 characters,
which is truncated as necessary.
.PP
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

Note that the keys used by the
\fCntpq\f[]\fR(8)\f[]
and
\fCntpdc\f[]\fR(8)\f[]
programs are checked against passwords
requested by the programs and entered by hand,
so it is generally appropriate to specify these keys in ASCII format.
