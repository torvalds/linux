.SH DESCRIPTION
This program generates cryptographic data files used by the NTPv4
authentication and identification schemes.
It can generate message digest keys used in symmetric key cryptography and,
if the OpenSSL software library has been installed, it can generate host keys,
signing keys, certificates, and identity keys and parameters used in Autokey
public key cryptography.
These files are used for cookie encryption,
digital signature, and challenge/response identification algorithms
compatible with the Internet standard security infrastructure.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

The message digest symmetric keys file is generated in a format
compatible with NTPv3.
All other files are in PEM-encoded printable ASCII format,
so they can be embedded as MIME attachments in email to other sites
and certificate authorities.
By default, files are not encrypted.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

When used to generate message digest symmetric keys, the program
produces a file containing ten pseudo-random printable ASCII strings
suitable for the MD5 message digest algorithm included in the
distribution.
If the OpenSSL library is installed, it produces an additional ten
hex-encoded random bit strings suitable for SHA1, AES-128-CMAC, and
other message digest algorithms.
The message digest symmetric keys file must be distributed and stored
using secure means beyond the scope of NTP itself.
Besides the keys used for ordinary NTP associations, additional keys
can be defined as passwords for the
\fCntpq\f[]\fR(@NTPQ_MS@)\f[]
and
\fCntpdc\f[]\fR(@NTPDC_MS@)\f[]
utility programs.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

The remaining generated files are compatible with other OpenSSL
applications and other Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) resources.
Certificates generated by this program are compatible with extant
industry practice, although some users might find the interpretation of
X509v3 extension fields somewhat liberal.
However, the identity keys are probably not compatible with anything
other than Autokey.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

Some files used by this program are encrypted using a private password.
The
\f\*[B-Font]\-p\f[]
option specifies the read password for local encrypted files and the
\f\*[B-Font]\-q\f[]
option the write password for encrypted files sent to remote sites.
If no password is specified, the host name returned by the Unix
\fChostname\f[]\fR(1)\f[]
command, normally the DNS name of the host, is used as the the default read
password, for convenience.
The
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
program prompts for the password if it reads an encrypted file
and the password is missing or incorrect.
If an encrypted file is read successfully and
no write password is specified, the read password is used
as the write password by default.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

The
\f\*[B-Font]pw\f[]
option of the
\f\*[B-Font]crypto\f[]
\fCntpd\f[]\fR(@NTPD_MS@)\f[]
configuration command specifies the read
password for previously encrypted local files.
This must match the local read password used by this program.
If not specified, the host name is used.
Thus, if files are generated by this program without an explicit password,
they can be read back by
\fCntpd\f[]\fR(@NTPD_MS@)\f[]
without specifying an explicit password but only on the same host.
If the write password used for encryption is specified as the host name,
these files can be read by that host with no explicit password.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

Normally, encrypted files for each host are generated by that host and
used only by that host, although exceptions exist as noted later on
this page.
The symmetric keys file, normally called
\fIntp.keys\f[],
is usually installed in
\fI/etc\f[].
Other files and links are usually installed in
\fI/usr/local/etc\f[],
which is normally in a shared filesystem in
NFS-mounted networks and cannot be changed by shared clients.
In these cases, NFS clients can specify the files in another
directory such as
\fI/etc\f[]
using the
\f\*[B-Font]keysdir\f[]
\fCntpd\f[]\fR(@NTPD_MS@)\f[]
configuration file command.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

This program directs commentary and error messages to the standard
error stream
\fIstderr\f[]
and remote files to the standard output stream
\fIstdout\f[]
where they can be piped to other applications or redirected to files.
The names used for generated files and links all begin with the
string
\fIntpkey\&*\f[]
and include the file type, generating host and filestamp,
as described in the
\fICryptographic Data Files\f[]
section below.
.SS Running the Program
The safest way to run the
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
program is logged in directly as root.
The recommended procedure is change to the
\f\*[I-Font]keys\f[]
directory, usually
\fI/usr/local/etc\f[],
then run the program.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

To test and gain experience with Autokey concepts, log in as root and
change to the
\f\*[I-Font]keys\f[]
directory, usually
\fI/usr/local/etc\f[].
When run for the first time, or if all files with names beginning with
\fIntpkey\&*\f[]
have been removed, use the
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
command without arguments to generate a default
\f\*[B-Font]RSA\f[]
host key and matching
\f\*[B-Font]RSA-MD5\f[]
certificate file with expiration date one year hence,
which is all that is necessary in many cases.
The program also generates soft links from the generic names
to the respective files.
If run again without options, the program uses the
existing keys and parameters and generates a new certificate file with
new expiration date one year hence, and soft link.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

The host key is used to encrypt the cookie when required and so must be
\f\*[B-Font]RSA\f[]
type.
By default, the host key is also the sign key used to encrypt signatures.
When necessary, a different sign key can be specified and this can be
either
\f\*[B-Font]RSA\f[]
or
\f\*[B-Font]DSA\f[]
type.
By default, the message digest type is
\f\*[B-Font]MD5\f[],
but any combination
of sign key type and message digest type supported by the OpenSSL library
can be specified, including those using the
\f\*[B-Font]AES128CMAC\f[], \f\*[B-Font]MD2\f[], \f\*[B-Font]MD5\f[], \f\*[B-Font]MDC2\f[], \f\*[B-Font]SHA\f[], \f\*[B-Font]SHA1\f[]
and
\f\*[B-Font]RIPE160\f[]
message digest algorithms.
However, the scheme specified in the certificate must be compatible
with the sign key.
Certificates using any digest algorithm are compatible with
\f\*[B-Font]RSA\f[]
sign keys;
however, only
\f\*[B-Font]SHA\f[]
and
\f\*[B-Font]SHA1\f[]
certificates are compatible with
\f\*[B-Font]DSA\f[]
sign keys.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

Private/public key files and certificates are compatible with
other OpenSSL applications and very likely other libraries as well.
Certificates or certificate requests derived from them should be compatible
with extant industry practice, although some users might find
the interpretation of X509v3 extension fields somewhat liberal.
However, the identification parameter files, although encoded
as the other files, are probably not compatible with anything other than Autokey.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

Running the program as other than root and using the Unix
\fCsu\f[]\fR(1)\f[]
command
to assume root may not work properly, since by default the OpenSSL library
looks for the random seed file
\fI.rnd\f[]
in the user home directory.
However, there should be only one
\fI.rnd\f[],
most conveniently
in the root directory, so it is convenient to define the
RANDFILE
environment variable used by the OpenSSL library as the path to
\fI.rnd\f[].
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

Installing the keys as root might not work in NFS-mounted
shared file systems, as NFS clients may not be able to write
to the shared keys directory, even as root.
In this case, NFS clients can specify the files in another
directory such as
\fI/etc\f[]
using the
\f\*[B-Font]keysdir\f[]
\fCntpd\f[]\fR(@NTPD_MS@)\f[]
configuration file command.
There is no need for one client to read the keys and certificates
of other clients or servers, as these data are obtained automatically
by the Autokey protocol.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

Ordinarily, cryptographic files are generated by the host that uses them,
but it is possible for a trusted agent (TA) to generate these files
for other hosts; however, in such cases files should always be encrypted.
The subject name and trusted name default to the hostname
of the host generating the files, but can be changed by command line options.
It is convenient to designate the owner name and trusted name
as the subject and issuer fields, respectively, of the certificate.
The owner name is also used for the host and sign key files,
while the trusted name is used for the identity files.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

All files are installed by default in the keys directory
\fI/usr/local/etc\f[],
which is normally in a shared filesystem
in NFS-mounted networks.
The actual location of the keys directory
and each file can be overridden by configuration commands,
but this is not recommended.
Normally, the files for each host are generated by that host
and used only by that host, although exceptions exist
as noted later on this page.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

Normally, files containing private values,
including the host key, sign key and identification parameters,
are permitted root read/write-only;
while others containing public values are permitted world readable.
Alternatively, files containing private values can be encrypted
and these files permitted world readable,
which simplifies maintenance in shared file systems.
Since uniqueness is insured by the
\f\*[I-Font]hostname\f[]
and
\f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[]
file name extensions, the files for an NTP server and
dependent clients can all be installed in the same shared directory.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

The recommended practice is to keep the file name extensions
when installing a file and to install a soft link
from the generic names specified elsewhere on this page
to the generated files.
This allows new file generations to be activated simply
by changing the link.
If a link is present,
\fCntpd\f[]\fR(@NTPD_MS@)\f[]
follows it to the file name to extract the
\f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[].
If a link is not present,
\fCntpd\f[]\fR(@NTPD_MS@)\f[]
extracts the
\f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[]
from the file itself.
This allows clients to verify that the file and generation times
are always current.
The
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
program uses the same
\f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[]
extension for all files generated
at one time, so each generation is distinct and can be readily
recognized in monitoring data.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

Run the command on as many hosts as necessary.
Designate one of them as the trusted host (TH) using
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
with the
\f\*[B-Font]\-T\f[]
option and configure it to synchronize from reliable Internet servers.
Then configure the other hosts to synchronize to the TH directly or
indirectly.
A certificate trail is created when Autokey asks the immediately
ascendant host towards the TH to sign its certificate, which is then
provided to the immediately descendant host on request.
All group hosts should have acyclic certificate trails ending on the TH.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

The host key is used to encrypt the cookie when required and so must be
RSA type.
By default, the host key is also the sign key used to encrypt
signatures.
A different sign key can be assigned using the
\f\*[B-Font]\-S\f[]
option and this can be either
\f\*[B-Font]RSA\f[]
or
\f\*[B-Font]DSA\f[]
type.
By default, the signature
message digest type is
\f\*[B-Font]MD5\f[],
but any combination of sign key type and
message digest type supported by the OpenSSL library can be specified
using the
\f\*[B-Font]\-c\f[]
option.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

The rules say cryptographic media should be generated with proventic
filestamps, which means the host should already be synchronized before
this program is run.
This of course creates a chicken-and-egg problem
when the host is started for the first time.
Accordingly, the host time
should be set by some other means, such as eyeball-and-wristwatch, at
least so that the certificate lifetime is within the current year.
After that and when the host is synchronized to a proventic source, the
certificate should be re-generated.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

Additional information on trusted groups and identity schemes is on the
\*[Lq]Autokey Public-Key Authentication\*[Rq]
page.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

File names begin with the prefix
\fIntpkey\f[]_
and end with the suffix
\fI_\f[]\f\*[I-Font]hostname\f[]. \f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[],
where
\f\*[I-Font]hostname\f[]
is the owner name, usually the string returned
by the Unix
\fChostname\f[]\fR(1)\f[]
command, and
\f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[]
is the NTP seconds when the file was generated, in decimal digits.
This both guarantees uniqueness and simplifies maintenance
procedures, since all files can be quickly removed
by a
\f\*[B-Font]rm\f[] \fIntpkey\&*\f[]
command or all files generated
at a specific time can be removed by a
\f\*[B-Font]rm\f[] \fI\&*\f[]\f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[]
command.
To further reduce the risk of misconfiguration,
the first two lines of a file contain the file name
and generation date and time as comments.
.SS Trusted Hosts and Groups
Each cryptographic configuration involves selection of a signature scheme
and identification scheme, called a cryptotype,
as explained in the
\fIAuthentication\f[] \fIOptions\f[]
section of
\fCntp.conf\f[]\fR(5)\f[].
The default cryptotype uses
\f\*[B-Font]RSA\f[]
encryption,
\f\*[B-Font]MD5\f[]
message digest
and
\f\*[B-Font]TC\f[]
identification.
First, configure a NTP subnet including one or more low-stratum
trusted hosts from which all other hosts derive synchronization
directly or indirectly.
Trusted hosts have trusted certificates;
all other hosts have nontrusted certificates.
These hosts will automatically and dynamically build authoritative
certificate trails to one or more trusted hosts.
A trusted group is the set of all hosts that have, directly or indirectly,
a certificate trail ending at a trusted host.
The trail is defined by static configuration file entries
or dynamic means described on the
\fIAutomatic\f[] \fINTP\f[] \fIConfiguration\f[] \fIOptions\f[]
section of
\fCntp.conf\f[]\fR(5)\f[].
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

On each trusted host as root, change to the keys directory.
To insure a fresh fileset, remove all
\fIntpkey\f[]
files.
Then run
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
\f\*[B-Font]\-T\f[]
to generate keys and a trusted certificate.
On all other hosts do the same, but leave off the
\f\*[B-Font]\-T\f[]
flag to generate keys and nontrusted certificates.
When complete, start the NTP daemons beginning at the lowest stratum
and working up the tree.
It may take some time for Autokey to instantiate the certificate trails
throughout the subnet, but setting up the environment is completely automatic.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

If it is necessary to use a different sign key or different digest/signature
scheme than the default, run
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
with the
\f\*[B-Font]\-S\f[] \f\*[I-Font]type\f[]
option, where
\f\*[I-Font]type\f[]
is either
\f\*[B-Font]RSA\f[]
or
\f\*[B-Font]DSA\f[].
The most frequent need to do this is when a
\f\*[B-Font]DSA\f[]\-signed
certificate is used.
If it is necessary to use a different certificate scheme than the default,
run
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
with the
\f\*[B-Font]\-c\f[] \f\*[I-Font]scheme\f[]
option and selected
\f\*[I-Font]scheme\f[]
as needed.
If
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
is run again without these options, it generates a new certificate
using the same scheme and sign key, and soft link.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

After setting up the environment it is advisable to update certificates
from time to time, if only to extend the validity interval.
Simply run
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
with the same flags as before to generate new certificates
using existing keys, and soft links.
However, if the host or sign key is changed,
\fCntpd\f[]\fR(@NTPD_MS@)\f[]
should be restarted.
When
\fCntpd\f[]\fR(@NTPD_MS@)\f[]
is restarted, it loads any new files and restarts the protocol.
Other dependent hosts will continue as usual until signatures are refreshed,
at which time the protocol is restarted.
.SS Identity Schemes
As mentioned on the Autonomous Authentication page,
the default
\f\*[B-Font]TC\f[]
identity scheme is vulnerable to a middleman attack.
However, there are more secure identity schemes available,
including
\f\*[B-Font]PC\f[], \f\*[B-Font]IFF\f[], \f\*[B-Font]GQ\f[]
and
\f\*[B-Font]MV\f[]
schemes described below.
These schemes are based on a TA, one or more trusted hosts
and some number of nontrusted hosts.
Trusted hosts prove identity using values provided by the TA,
while the remaining hosts prove identity using values provided
by a trusted host and certificate trails that end on that host.
The name of a trusted host is also the name of its sugroup
and also the subject and issuer name on its trusted certificate.
The TA is not necessarily a trusted host in this sense, but often is.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

In some schemes there are separate keys for servers and clients.
A server can also be a client of another server,
but a client can never be a server for another client.
In general, trusted hosts and nontrusted hosts that operate
as both server and client have parameter files that contain
both server and client keys.
Hosts that operate
only as clients have key files that contain only client keys.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

The PC scheme supports only one trusted host in the group.
On trusted host alice run
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
\f\*[B-Font]\-P\f[]
\f\*[B-Font]\-p\f[] \f\*[I-Font]password\f[]
to generate the host key file
\fIntpkey\f[]_ \f\*[B-Font]RSA\f[] \fIkey_alice.\f[] \f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[]
and trusted private certificate file
\fIntpkey\f[]_ \f\*[B-Font]RSA-MD5\f[] \f\*[B-Font]_\f[] \fIcert_alice.\f[] \f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[],
and soft links.
Copy both files to all group hosts;
they replace the files which would be generated in other schemes.
On each host
\f\*[I-Font]bob\f[]
install a soft link from the generic name
\fIntpkey_host_\f[]\f\*[I-Font]bob\f[]
to the host key file and soft link
\fIntpkey_cert_\f[]\f\*[I-Font]bob\f[]
to the private certificate file.
Note the generic links are on bob, but point to files generated
by trusted host alice.
In this scheme it is not possible to refresh
either the keys or certificates without copying them
to all other hosts in the group, and recreating the soft links.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

For the
\f\*[B-Font]IFF\f[]
scheme proceed as in the
\f\*[B-Font]TC\f[]
scheme to generate keys
and certificates for all group hosts, then for every trusted host in the group,
generate the
\f\*[B-Font]IFF\f[]
parameter file.
On trusted host alice run
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
\f\*[B-Font]\-T\f[]
\f\*[B-Font]\-I\f[]
\f\*[B-Font]\-p\f[] \f\*[I-Font]password\f[]
to produce her parameter file
\fIntpkey_IFFpar_alice.\f[]\f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[],
which includes both server and client keys.
Copy this file to all group hosts that operate as both servers
and clients and install a soft link from the generic
\fIntpkey_iff_alice\f[]
to this file.
If there are no hosts restricted to operate only as clients,
there is nothing further to do.
As the
\f\*[B-Font]IFF\f[]
scheme is independent
of keys and certificates, these files can be refreshed as needed.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

If a rogue client has the parameter file, it could masquerade
as a legitimate server and present a middleman threat.
To eliminate this threat, the client keys can be extracted
from the parameter file and distributed to all restricted clients.
After generating the parameter file, on alice run
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
\f\*[B-Font]\-e\f[]
and pipe the output to a file or email program.
Copy or email this file to all restricted clients.
On these clients install a soft link from the generic
\fIntpkey_iff_alice\f[]
to this file.
To further protect the integrity of the keys,
each file can be encrypted with a secret password.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

For the
\f\*[B-Font]GQ\f[]
scheme proceed as in the
\f\*[B-Font]TC\f[]
scheme to generate keys
and certificates for all group hosts, then for every trusted host
in the group, generate the
\f\*[B-Font]IFF\f[]
parameter file.
On trusted host alice run
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
\f\*[B-Font]\-T\f[]
\f\*[B-Font]\-G\f[]
\f\*[B-Font]\-p\f[] \f\*[I-Font]password\f[]
to produce her parameter file
\fIntpkey_GQpar_alice.\f[]\f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[],
which includes both server and client keys.
Copy this file to all group hosts and install a soft link
from the generic
\fIntpkey_gq_alice\f[]
to this file.
In addition, on each host
\f\*[I-Font]bob\f[]
install a soft link
from generic
\fIntpkey_gq_\f[]\f\*[I-Font]bob\f[]
to this file.
As the
\f\*[B-Font]GQ\f[]
scheme updates the
\f\*[B-Font]GQ\f[]
parameters file and certificate
at the same time, keys and certificates can be regenerated as needed.

For the
\f\*[B-Font]MV\f[]
scheme, proceed as in the
\f\*[B-Font]TC\f[]
scheme to generate keys
and certificates for all group hosts.
For illustration assume trish is the TA, alice one of several trusted hosts
and bob one of her clients.
On TA trish run
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
\f\*[B-Font]\-V\f[] \f\*[I-Font]n\f[]
\f\*[B-Font]\-p\f[] \f\*[I-Font]password\f[],
where
\f\*[I-Font]n\f[]
is the number of revokable keys (typically 5) to produce
the parameter file
\fIntpkeys_MVpar_trish.\f[]\f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[]
and client key files
\fIntpkeys_MVkey\f[]\f\*[I-Font]d\f[] \f\*[I-Font]_\f[] \fItrish.\f[] \f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[]
where
\f\*[I-Font]d\f[]
is the key number (0 \&<
\f\*[I-Font]d\f[]
\&<
\f\*[I-Font]n\f[]).
Copy the parameter file to alice and install a soft link
from the generic
\fIntpkey_mv_alice\f[]
to this file.
Copy one of the client key files to alice for later distribution
to her clients.
It does not matter which client key file goes to alice,
since they all work the same way.
Alice copies the client key file to all of her clients.
On client bob install a soft link from generic
\fIntpkey_mvkey_bob\f[]
to the client key file.
As the
\f\*[B-Font]MV\f[]
scheme is independent of keys and certificates,
these files can be refreshed as needed.

.PP
.SS Random Seed File
All cryptographically sound key generation schemes must have means
to randomize the entropy seed used to initialize
the internal pseudo-random number generator used
by the library routines.
The OpenSSL library uses a designated random seed file for this purpose.
The file must be available when starting the NTP daemon and
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
program.
If a site supports OpenSSL or its companion OpenSSH,
it is very likely that means to do this are already available.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

It is important to understand that entropy must be evolved
for each generation, for otherwise the random number sequence
would be predictable.
Various means dependent on external events, such as keystroke intervals,
can be used to do this and some systems have built-in entropy sources.
Suitable means are described in the OpenSSL software documentation,
but are outside the scope of this page.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

The entropy seed used by the OpenSSL library is contained in a file,
usually called
\fI.rnd\f[],
which must be available when starting the NTP daemon
or the
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
program.
The NTP daemon will first look for the file
using the path specified by the
\f\*[B-Font]randfile\f[]
subcommand of the
\f\*[B-Font]crypto\f[]
configuration command.
If not specified in this way, or when starting the
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
program,
the OpenSSL library will look for the file using the path specified
by the
RANDFILE
environment variable in the user home directory,
whether root or some other user.
If the
RANDFILE
environment variable is not present,
the library will look for the
\fI.rnd\f[]
file in the user home directory.
Since both the
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
program and
\fCntpd\f[]\fR(@NTPD_MS@)\f[]
daemon must run as root, the logical place to put this file is in
\fI/.rnd\f[]
or
\fI/root/.rnd\f[].
If the file is not available or cannot be written,
the daemon exits with a message to the system log and the program
exits with a suitable error message.
.SS Cryptographic Data Files
All file formats begin with two nonencrypted lines.
The first line contains the file name, including the generated host name
and filestamp, in the format
\fIntpkey_\f[]\f\*[I-Font]key\f[] \f\*[I-Font]_\f[] \f\*[I-Font]name\f[]. \f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[],
where
\f\*[I-Font]key\f[]
is the key or parameter type,
\f\*[I-Font]name\f[]
is the host or group name and
\f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[]
is the filestamp (NTP seconds) when the file was created.
By convention,
\f\*[I-Font]key\f[]
names in generated file names include both upper and lower case
characters, while
\f\*[I-Font]key\f[]
names in generated link names include only lower case characters.
The filestamp is not used in generated link names.
The second line contains the datestamp in conventional Unix
\fIdate\f[]
format.
Lines beginning with
\[oq]#\[cq]
are considered comments and ignored by the
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
program and
\fCntpd\f[]\fR(@NTPD_MS@)\f[]
daemon.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

The remainder of the file contains cryptographic data, encoded first using ASN.1
rules, then encrypted if necessary, and finally written in PEM-encoded
printable ASCII text, preceded and followed by MIME content identifier lines.
.sp \n(Ppu
.ne 2

The format of the symmetric keys file, ordinarily named
\fIntp.keys\f[],
is somewhat different than the other files in the interest of backward compatibility.
Ordinarily, the file is generated by this program, but it can be constructed
and edited using an ordinary text editor.

where
\f\*[I-Font]keyno\f[]

\f\*[I-Font]type\f[]
is the key type for the message digest algorithm, which in the absence of the
OpenSSL library must be
\f\*[B-Font]MD5\f[]
to designate the MD5 message digest algorithm;
if the OpenSSL library is installed, the key type can be any
message digest algorithm supported by that library;
however, if compatibility with FIPS 140-2 is required,
the key type must be either
\f\*[B-Font]SHA\f[]
or
\f\*[B-Font]SHA1\f[];
\f\*[I-Font]key\f[]
is the key itself,
which is a printable ASCII string 20 characters or less in length:
each character is chosen from the 93 printable characters
in the range 0x21 through 0x7e (
\[oq]\[cq]!
through
\[oq]~\[cq]
\&) excluding space and the
\[oq]#\[cq]

program generates a symmetric keys file
\fIntpkey_MD5key_\f[]\f\*[I-Font]hostname\f[]. \f\*[I-Font]filestamp\f[].
Since the file contains private shared keys,
it should be visible only to root and distributed by secure means
to other subnet hosts.
The NTP daemon loads the file
\fIntp.keys\f[],
so
\f\*[B-Font]ntp-keygen\fP
installs a soft link from this name to the generated file.
Subsequently, similar soft links must be installed by manual

While this file is not used with the Autokey Version 2 protocol,
it is needed to authenticate some remote configuration commands
used by the

.SH "OPTION PRESETS"
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s) and values from
environment variables named:
.nf
  \fBNTP_KEYGEN_<option-name>\fP or \fBNTP_KEYGEN\fP
.fi
.ad
The environmental presets take precedence (are processed later than)
the configuration files.
The \fIhomerc\fP files are "\fI$HOME\fP", and "\fI.\fP".
If any of these are directories, then the file \fI.ntprc\fP
is searched for within those directories.
