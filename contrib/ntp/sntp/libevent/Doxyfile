# Doxyfile 1.5.1

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY        = doxygen/

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen 
# will interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a JavaDoc-style 
# comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the JavaDoc 
# comments will behave just like the Qt-style comments (thus requiring an 
# explicit @brief command for a brief description.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C 
# sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. 
# For instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list 
# of all members will be omitted, etc.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = YES

# If the SORT_BRIEF_DOCS tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the 
# brief documentation of file, namespace and class members alphabetically 
# by member name. If set to NO (the default) the members will appear in 
# declaration order.

SORT_BRIEF_DOCS        = YES

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then the STRIP_FROM_PATH tag 
# can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path. Stripping is 
# only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand part of 
# the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list. 
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the 
# path to strip.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        = include/

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain 
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or 
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories 
# with spaces.

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will 
# generate Latex output.

GENERATE_LATEX         = YES

# The LATEX_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the LaTeX docs will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be 
# put in front of it. If left blank `latex' will be used as the default path.

LATEX_OUTPUT           = latex

# The LATEX_CMD_NAME tag can be used to specify the LaTeX command name to be 
# invoked. If left blank `latex' will be used as the default command name.

LATEX_CMD_NAME         = latex

# The MAKEINDEX_CMD_NAME tag can be used to specify the command name to 
# generate index for LaTeX. If left blank `makeindex' will be used as the 
# default command name.

MAKEINDEX_CMD_NAME     = makeindex

# If the COMPACT_LATEX tag is set to YES Doxygen generates more compact 
# LaTeX documents. This may be useful for small projects and may help to 
# save some trees in general.

COMPACT_LATEX          = NO

# The PAPER_TYPE tag can be used to set the paper type that is used 
# by the printer. Possible values are: a4, a4wide, letter, legal and 
# executive. If left blank a4wide will be used.

PAPER_TYPE             = a4wide

# The EXTRA_PACKAGES tag can be to specify one or more names of LaTeX 
# packages that should be included in the LaTeX output.

EXTRA_PACKAGES         = 

# The LATEX_HEADER tag can be used to specify a personal LaTeX header for 
# the generated latex document. The header should contain everything until 
# the first chapter. If it is left blank doxygen will generate a 
# standard header. Notice: only use this tag if you know what you are doing!

LATEX_HEADER           = 

# If the PDF_HYPERLINKS tag is set to YES, the LaTeX that is generated 
# is prepared for conversion to pdf (using ps2pdf). The pdf file will 
# contain links (just like the HTML output) instead of page references 
# This makes the output suitable for online browsing using a pdf viewer.

PDF_HYPERLINKS         = NO

# If the USE_PDFLATEX tag is set to YES, pdflatex will be used instead of 
# plain latex in the generated Makefile. Set this option to YES to get a 
# higher quality PDF documentation.

USE_PDFLATEX           = YES

# If the LATEX_BATCHMODE tag is set to YES, doxygen will add the \\batchmode. 
# command to the generated LaTeX files. This will instruct LaTeX to keep 
# running if errors occur, instead of asking the user for help. 
# This option is also used when generating formulas in HTML.

LATEX_BATCHMODE        = NO

# If LATEX_HIDE_INDICES is set to YES then doxygen will not 
# include the index chapters (such as File Index, Compound Index, etc.)

# the generated man pages (default is the subroutine's section .3)

MAN_EXTENSION          = .3

# If the MAN_LINKS tag is set to YES and Doxygen generates man output, 
# then it will generate one additional man file for each entity 
# documented in the real man page(s). These additional files 
# only source the real man page, but without them the man command 
# would be unable to find the correct page. The default is NO.

MAN_LINKS              = YES

# Configuration options related to the preprocessor

# If the ENABLE_PREPROCESSING tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will 
# evaluate all C-preprocessor directives found in the sources and include 
# files.

ENABLE_PREPROCESSING   = YES

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION tag is set to YES Doxygen will expand all macro 
# names in the source code. If set to NO (the default) only conditional 
# compilation will be performed. Macro expansion can be done in a controlled 
# way by setting EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF to YES.

MACRO_EXPANSION        = NO

# If the EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF and MACRO_EXPANSION tags are both set to YES 
# then the macro expansion is limited to the macros specified with the 
# PREDEFINED and EXPAND_AS_DEFINED tags.

EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF     = NO

# If the SEARCH_INCLUDES tag is set to YES (the default) the includes files 
# in the INCLUDE_PATH (see below) will be search if a #include is found.

SEARCH_INCLUDES        = YES

# The INCLUDE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more directories that 
# contain include files that are not input files but should be processed by 
# the preprocessor.

INCLUDE_PATH           = 

# You can use the INCLUDE_FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard 
# patterns (like *.h and *.hpp) to filter out the header-files in the 
# directories. If left blank, the patterns specified with FILE_PATTERNS will 
# be used.

INCLUDE_FILE_PATTERNS  = 

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that 
# are defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of 
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name 
# or name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the = are 
# omitted =1 is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being 
# undefined via #undef or recursively expanded use the := operator 
# instead of the = operator.

PREDEFINED             = TAILQ_ENTRY RB_ENTRY EVENT_DEFINED_TQENTRY_ EVENT_IN_DOXYGEN_

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION and EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF tags are set to YES then 
# this tag can be used to specify a list of macro names that should be expanded. 
# The macro definition that is found in the sources will be used. 
# Use the PREDEFINED tag if you want to use a different macro definition.

EXPAND_AS_DEFINED      = 

# If the SKIP_FUNCTION_MACROS tag is set to YES (the default) then 
# doxygen's preprocessor will remove all function-like macros that are alone 
# on a line, have an all uppercase name, and do not end with a semicolon. Such 
# function macros are typically used for boiler-plate code, and will confuse 
# the parser if not removed.

SKIP_FUNCTION_MACROS   = YES
