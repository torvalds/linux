Run 'PROGRAM [ARGUMENT]...', returning a proper advice when this fails due
to PROGRAM being missing or too old.

Options:
  -h, --help      display this help and exit
  -v, --version   output version information and exit

Supported PROGRAM values:
  aclocal   autoconf  autoheader   autom4te  automake  makeinfo
  bison     yacc      flex         lex       help2man

Version suffixes to PROGRAM as well as the prefixes 'gnu-', 'gnu', and
'g' are ignored when checking the name.
