.Nm
can be used as an SNTP client to query a NTP or SNTP server and either display
the time or set the local system's time (given suitable privilege).  It can be
run as an interactive command or from a
.Ic cron
job.

NTP (the Network Time Protocol) and SNTP (the Simple Network Time Protocol)
are defined and described by RFC 5905.

.Pp
The default is to write the estimated correct local date and time (i.e. not
UTC) to the standard output in a format like:

.Ic "'1996-10-15 20:17:25.123 (+0800) +4.567 +/- 0.089 [host] IP sN'"

where the
.Ic "'(+0800)'"
means that to get to UTC from the reported local time one must
add 8 hours and 0 minutes,
the
.Ic "'+4.567'"
indicates the local clock is 4.567 seconds behind the correct time
(so 4.567 seconds must be added to the local clock to get it to be correct).
Note that the number of decimals printed for this value will change
based on the reported precision of the server.
.Ic "'+/- 0.089'"
is the reported
.Em synchronization distance
(in seconds), which represents the maximum error due to all causes.
If the server does not report valid data needed to calculate the
synchronization distance, this will be reported as
.Ic "'+/- ?'" .
If the
.Em host
is different from the
.Em IP ,
both will be displayed.
Otherwise, only the 
.Em IP
is displayed.
Finally, the
.Em stratum
of the host is reported
and the leap indicator is decoded and displayed.

.It Li "sntp ntpserver.somewhere"
is the simplest use of this program
and can be run as an unprivileged command
to check the current time and error in the local clock.
.It Li "sntp -Ss -M 128 ntpserver.somewhere"
With suitable privilege,
run as a command
or from a
.Xr cron 8
job,
.Ic "sntp -Ss -M 128 ntpserver.somewhere"
will request the time from the server,
and if that server reports that it is synchronized
then if the offset adjustment is less than 128 milliseconds
the correction will be slewed,
and if the correction is more than 128 milliseconds
the correction  will be stepped.
.It Li "sntp -S ntpserver.somewhere"
With suitable privilege,
run as a command
or from a
.Xr cron 8
job,
.Ic "sntp -S ntpserver.somewhere"
will set (step) the local clock from a synchronized specified server,
like the (deprecated)
.Xr ntpdate 1ntpdatemdoc ,
or
.Xr rdate 8
commands.
