New in 3.0.3:

* The generated C code is compatible with gcc-4.3.x in c99 or gnu99 mode.

New in 3.0.2:

* Compiles with g++-4.0.x.
* Added option --length-table-name.
* Added declaration %define length-table-name.
* Fixed  #line directives for filenames containing backslashes.

New in 3.0.1:

* Bug fix.

New in 3.0:

* Added option --output that allows to specify the output file name.
* Some options have been renamed:
    --hash-fn-name=NAME     -->   --hash-function-name=NAME
    --lookup-fn-name=NAME   -->   --lookup-function-name=NAME
    --compare-strlen        -->   --compare-lengths
    --global                -->   --global-table
  The older variants are still supported for backward compatibility.
* The following options can now be specified inside the input file:
    %delimiters=DELIMITER-LIST
    %struct-type
    %ignore-case
    %language=LANGUAGE-NAME
    %define slot-name NAME
    %define initializer-suffix INITIALIZERS
    %define hash-function-name NAME
    %define lookup-function-name NAME
    %define class-name NAME
    %7bit
    %compare-lengths
    %compare-strncmp
    %readonly-tables
    %enum
    %includes
    %global-table
    %pic
    %define string-pool-name NAME
    %null-strings
    %define word-array-name NAME
    %switch=COUNT
    %omit-struct-type
* When the option -k is not given, the default key positions are now
  computed depending on the set of keywords.
* If the input file is given by name, the output file will now contain
  #line directives referring to the input file.
* Some keyword sets containing permutations, like { "xy", "yx", "xz", "zx" }
  or { "abc", "acb", "bca", "cab" }, are now handled by gperf without
  requiring the option -D.
* The generated table is usually much smaller than it was with earlier
  versions of gperf.
* Added option -m/--multiple-iterations that allows to further reduce the
  size of the generated table.
* When the search for a good hash function is not immediately successful,
  the table's size will grow as needed. Earlier versions of gperf bailed
  out with an "Internal error, duplicate hash code value".
* The options -f/--fast and -o/--occurrence-sort have no effect any more.
* Added options -P/--pic and --null-strings that optimize the generated code
  for use in shared libraries. -P/--pic does a perfect optimization but may
  require some small code changes (see the documentation for details), whereas
  --null-strings does only a half-hearted optimization but works without
  needing any change to surrounding code.
* Added option --ignore-case that produces a case independent lookup function.
* Bug fixes.

New in 2.7.2:

* Keywords may now be enclosed in double quotes; this permits the use of
  '#', ',', space or NUL inside keywords.
* Bug fixes.

New in 2.7.1:

* Added option "-F" for gcc.

New in 2.7:

* gperf is now a stand-alone package, untied from libg++.
* Autoconfiguring.
* Removed the "-a" and "-g" options, extended the "-L" option instead.
* Removed the "-p" option, it is the default.
* Added long options ("--help", "--version" etc.).
* 8-bit cleanliness is now the default; use "-7" to get the old behaviour.
* Compiles with any C++ compiler.
* Numerous small improvements.
