.SH NAME
gperf \- generate a perfect hash function from a key set
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gperf
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIINPUT-FILE\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
GNU 'gperf' generates perfect hash functions.
.PP
If a long option shows an argument as mandatory, then it is mandatory
for the equivalent short option also.
.SS "Output file location:"
.HP
\fB\-\-output\-file\fR=\fIFILE\fR Write output to specified file.
.PP
The results are written to standard output if no output file is specified
or if it is -.
.SS "Input file interpretation:"
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-delimiters\fR=\fIDELIMITER\-LIST\fR
Allow user to provide a string containing delimiters
used to separate keywords from their attributes.
Default is ",".
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-struct\-type\fR
Allows the user to include a structured type
declaration for generated code. Any text before %%
is considered part of the type declaration. Key
words and additional fields may follow this, one
group of fields per line.
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-case\fR
Consider upper and lower case ASCII characters as
equivalent. Note that locale dependent case mappings
are ignored.
.SS "Language for the output code:"
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-language\fR=\fILANGUAGE\-NAME\fR
Generates code in the specified language. Languages
handled are currently C++, ANSI-C, C, and KR-C. The
default is C.
.SS "Details in the output code:"
.TP
\fB\-K\fR, \fB\-\-slot\-name\fR=\fINAME\fR
Select name of the keyword component in the keyword
structure.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-initializer\-suffix\fR=\fIINITIALIZERS\fR
Initializers for additional components in the keyword
structure.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-hash\-function\-name\fR=\fINAME\fR
Specify name of generated hash function. Default is
\&'hash'.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-lookup\-function\-name\fR=\fINAME\fR
Specify name of generated lookup function. Default
name is 'in_word_set'.
.TP
\fB\-Z\fR, \fB\-\-class\-name\fR=\fINAME\fR
Specify name of generated C++ class. Default name is
\&'Perfect_Hash'.
.TP
\fB\-7\fR, \fB\-\-seven\-bit\fR
Assume 7-bit characters.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-compare\-lengths\fR
Compare key lengths before trying a string
comparison. This is necessary if the keywords
contain NUL bytes. It also helps cut down on the
number of string comparisons made during the lookup.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-compare\-strncmp\fR
Generate comparison code using strncmp rather than
strcmp.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-readonly\-tables\fR
Make the contents of generated lookup tables
constant, i.e., readonly.
.TP
\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-enum\fR
Define constant values using an enum local to the
lookup function rather than with defines.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-includes\fR
Include the necessary system include file <string.h>
at the beginning of the code.
.TP
\fB\-G\fR, \fB\-\-global\-table\fR
Generate the static table of keywords as a static
global variable, rather than hiding it inside of the
lookup function (which is the default behavior).
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-pic\fR
Optimize the generated table for inclusion in shared
libraries.  This reduces the startup time of programs
using a shared library containing the generated code.
.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-string\-pool\-name\fR=\fINAME\fR
Specify name of string pool generated by option \fB\-\-pic\fR.
Default name is 'stringpool'.
.TP
\fB\-\-null\-strings\fR
Use NULL strings instead of empty strings for empty
keyword table entries.
.TP
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-word\-array\-name\fR=\fINAME\fR
Specify name of word list array. Default name is
\&'wordlist'.
.TP
\fB\-\-length\-table\-name\fR=\fINAME\fR
Specify name of length table array. Default name is
\&'lengthtable'.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-switch\fR=\fICOUNT\fR
Causes the generated C code to use a switch
statement scheme, rather than an array lookup table.
This can lead to a reduction in both time and space
requirements for some keyfiles. The COUNT argument
determines how many switch statements are generated.
A value of 1 generates 1 switch containing all the
elements, a value of 2 generates 2 tables with 1/2
the elements in each table, etc. If COUNT is very
large, say 1000000, the generated C code does a
binary search.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-omit\-struct\-type\fR
Prevents the transfer of the type declaration to the
output file. Use this option if the type is already
defined elsewhere.
.SS "Algorithm employed by gperf:"
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-key\-positions\fR=\fIKEYS\fR
Select the key positions used in the hash function.
The allowable choices range between 1-255, inclusive.
The positions are separated by commas, ranges may be
used, and key positions may occur in any order.
Also, the meta-character '*' causes the generated
hash function to consider ALL key positions, and $
indicates the "final character" of a key, e.g.,
$,1,2,4,6-10.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-duplicates\fR
Handle keywords that hash to duplicate values. This
is useful for certain highly redundant keyword sets.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-multiple\-iterations\fR=\fIITERATIONS\fR
Perform multiple choices of the \fB\-i\fR and \fB\-j\fR values,
and choose the best results. This increases the
running time by a factor of ITERATIONS but does a
good job minimizing the generated table size.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-initial\-asso\fR=\fIN\fR
Provide an initial value for the associate values
array. Default is 0. Setting this value larger helps
inflate the size of the final table.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-jump\fR=\fIJUMP\-VALUE\fR
Affects the "jump value", i.e., how far to advance
the associated character value upon collisions. Must
be an odd number, default is 5.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-strlen\fR
Do not include the length of the keyword when
computing the hash function.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-random\fR
Utilizes randomness to initialize the associated
values table.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-size\-multiple\fR=\fIN\fR
Affects the size of the generated hash table. The
numeric argument N indicates "how many times larger
or smaller" the associated value range should be,
in relationship to the number of keys, e.g. a value
of 3 means "allow the maximum associated value to
be about 3 times larger than the number of input
keys". Conversely, a value of 1/3 means "make the
maximum associated value about 3 times smaller than
the number of input keys". A larger table should
decrease the time required for an unsuccessful
search, at the expense of extra table space. Default
value is 1.
.SS "Informative output:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print this message.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print the gperf version number.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Enables the debugging option (produces verbose
output to the standard error).
