## Note that this doesn't just cater to obsosete pre-3.x GCC compilers.

## (see the conditional assignment to $gccflag above).
## There are various ways to get dependency output from gcc.  Here's
## why we pick this rather obscure method:
## - Don't want to use -MD because we'd like the dependencies to end
##   up in a subdir.  Having to rename by hand is ugly.
##   (We might end up doing this anyway to support other compilers.)
## - The DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT environment variable makes gcc act like
##   -MM, not -M (despite what the docs say).  Also, it might not be
##   supported by the other compilers which use the 'gcc' depmode.
## - Using -M directly means running the compiler twice (even worse
##   than renaming).

## This next piece of magic avoids the "deleted header file" problem.
## The problem is that when a header file which appears in a .P file
## is deleted, the dependency causes make to die (because there is
## typically no way to rebuild the header).  We avoid this by adding
## dummy dependencies for each header file.  Too bad gcc doesn't do
## this for us directly.
## Some versions of gcc put a space before the ':'.  On the theory
## that the space means something, we add a space to the output as
## well.  hp depmode also adds that space, but also prefixes the VPATH
## to the object.  Take care to not repeat it in the output.
## Some versions of the HPUX 10.20 sed can't process this invocation
## correctly.  Breaking it into two sed invocations is a workaround.
