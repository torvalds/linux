.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lessecho
.I "[-ox] [-cx] [-pn] [-dn] [-mx] [-nn] [-ex] [-a] file ..."
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I lessecho
is a program that simply echos its arguments on standard output.
But any metacharacter in the output is preceded by an "escape"
character, which by default is a backslash.

are surrounded by quotes instead.

which is used if the -e- option is specified.
