.Dt LIBXO 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm libxo
.Nd library for emitting text, XML, JSON, or HTML output
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libxo
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libxo/xo.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The functions defined in
.Nm
are used to generate a choice of
.Em TEXT ,
.Em XML ,
.Em JSON ,
or
.Em HTML
output.
A common set of functions are used, with
command line switches passed to the library to control the details of
the output.
.Pp
Most commands emit text output aimed at humans.
It is designed
to be parsed and understood by a user.
Humans are gifted at extracting
details and pattern matching.
Often programmers need to extract
information from this human-oriented output.
Programmers use tools
like
.Xr grep 1 ,
.Xr awk 1 ,
and regular expressions to ferret out the pieces of
information they need.
Such solutions are fragile and require
updates when output contents change or evolve, requiring testing and
validation.
.Pp
Modern tool developers favor encoding schemes like XML and JSON,
which allow trivial parsing and extraction of data.
Such formats are
simple, well understood, hierarchical, easily parsed, and often
integrate easier with common tools and environments.
.Pp
In addition, modern reality means that more output ends up in web
browsers than in terminals, making HTML output valuable.
.Pp
.Nm
allows a single set of function calls in source code to generate
traditional text output, as well as XML and JSON formatted data.
HTML
can also be generated; "<div>" elements surround the traditional text
output, with attributes that detail how to render the data.
.Pp
There are four encoding styles supported by
.Nm :
.Bl -bullet
.It
TEXT output can be display on a terminal session, allowing
compatibility with traditional command line usage.
.It
XML output is suitable for tools like XPath and protocols like
NETCONF.
.It
JSON output can be used for RESTful APIs and integration with
languages like Javascript and Python.
.It
HTML can be matched with a small CSS file to permit rendering in any
HTML5 browser.
.El
.Pp
In general, XML and JSON are suitable for encoding data, while TEXT is
suited for terminal output and HTML is suited for display in a web
browser (see
.Xr xohtml 1 ).
.Pp
The
.Nm
library allows an application to generate text, XML, JSON,
and HTML output using a common set of function calls.
The application
decides at run time which output style should be produced.
The
application calls a function
.Xr xo_emit 3
to product output that is
described in a format string.
A
.Dq field descriptor
tells
.Nm
what the field is and what it means.
Each field descriptor is placed in
braces with a printf-like format string:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
    xo_emit(" {:lines/%7ju} {:words/%7ju} "
            "{:characters/%7ju}{d:filename/%s}\\n",
            linect, wordct, charct, file);
.Ed
.Pp
Each field can have a role, with the 'value' role being the default,
and the role tells
.Nm
how and when to render that field, as well as
a
.Xr printf 3 Ns -like
format string.
.Pp
Output
can then be generated in various style, using the "--libxo" option.
.Sh DEFAULT HANDLE
Handles give an abstraction for
.Nm
that encapsulates the state of a
stream of output.
Handles have the data type "xo_handle_t" and are
opaque to the caller.
.Pp
The library has a default handle that is automatically initialized.
By default, this handle will send text style output to standard output.
The
.Xr xo_set_style 3
and
.Xr xo_set_flags 3
functions can be used to change this
behavior.
.Pp
Many
.Nm
functions take a handle as their first parameter; most that
do not use the default handle.
Any function taking a handle can
be passed
.Dv NULL
to access the default handle.
.Pp
For the typical command that is generating output on standard output,
there is no need to create an explicit handle, but they are available
when needed, e.g., for daemons that generate multiple streams of
output.
.Sh FUNCTION OVERVIEW
The
.Nm
library includes the following functions:
.Bl -tag -width "xo_close_container_hd"
.It Sy "Function               Description"
.It Fn xo_attr
.It Fn xo_attr_h
.It Fn xo_attr_hv
Allows the caller to emit XML attributes with the next open element.
.It Fn xo_create
.It Fn xo_create_to_file
Allow the caller to create a new handle.
Note that
.Nm
has a default handle that allows the caller to avoid use of an
explicitly created handle.
Only callers writing to files other than
.Dv stdout
would need to call
.Fn xo_create .
.It Fn xo_destroy
Frees any resources associated with the handle, including the handle
itself.
.It Fn xo_emit
.It Fn xo_emit_h
.It Fn xo_emit_hv
Emit formatted output.
The
.Fa fmt
string controls the conversion of the remaining arguments into
formatted output.
See
.Xr xo_format 5
for details.
.It Fn xo_emit_warn
.It Fn xo_emit_warnx
.It Fn xo_emit_warn_c
.It Fn xo_emit_warn_hc
.It Fn xo_emit_err
.It Fn xo_emit_errc
.It Fn xo_emit_errx
These functions are mildly compatible with their standard libc
namesakes, but use the format string defined in
.Xr xo_format 5 .
While there is an increased cost for converting the strings, the
output provided can be richer and more useful.   See also
.Xr xo_err 3
.It Fn xo_warn
.It Fn xo_warnx
.It Fn xo_warn_c
.It Fn xo_warn_hc
.It Fn xo_err
.It Fn xo_errc
.It Fn xo_errx
.It Fn xo_message
.It Fn xo_message_c
.It Fn xo_message_hc
.It Fn xo_message_hcv
These functions are meant to be compatible with their standard libc namesakes.
.It Fn xo_finish
.It Fn xo_finish_h
Flush output, close open construct, and complete any pending
operations.
.It Fn xo_flush
.It Fn xo_flush_h
Allow the caller to flush any pending output for a handle.
.It Fn xo_no_setlocale
Direct
.Nm
to avoid initializing the locale.
This function should be called before any other
.Nm
function is called.
.It Fn xo_open_container
.It Fn xo_open_container_h
.It Fn xo_open_container_hd
.It Fn xo_open_container_d
.It Fn xo_close_container
.It Fn xo_close_container_h
.It Fn xo_close_container_hd
.It Fn xo_close_container_d
Containers a singleton levels of hierarchy, typically used to organize
related content.
.It Fn xo_open_list_h
.It Fn xo_open_list
.It Fn xo_open_list_hd
.It Fn xo_open_list_d
.It Fn xo_open_instance_h
.It Fn xo_open_instance
.It Fn xo_open_instance_hd
.It Fn xo_open_instance_d
.It Fn xo_close_instance_h
.It Fn xo_close_instance
.It Fn xo_close_instance_hd
.It Fn xo_close_instance_d
.It Fn xo_close_list_h
.It Fn xo_close_list
.It Fn xo_close_list_hd
.It Fn xo_close_list_d
Lists are levels of hierarchy that can appear multiple times within
the same parent.
Two calls are needed to encapsulate them, one for
the list and one for each instance of that list.
Typically
.Fn xo_open_list
and
.Fn xo_close_list
are called outside a
for-loop, where
.Fn xo_open_instance
it called at the top of the loop, and
.Fn xo_close_instance
is called at the bottom of the loop.
.It Fn xo_parse_args
Inspects command line arguments for directions to
.Nm .
This function should be called before
.Va argv
is inspected by the application.
.It Fn xo_set_allocator
Instructs
.Nm
to use an alternative memory allocator and deallocator.
.It Fn xo_set_flags
.It Fn xo_clear_flags
Change the flags set for a handle.
.It Fn xo_set_info
Provides additional information about elements for use with HTML
rendering.
.It Fn xo_set_options
Changes formatting options used by handle.
.It Fn xo_set_style
.It Fn xo_set_style_name
Changes the output style used by a handle.
.It Fn xo_set_writer
Instructs
.Nm
to use an alternative set of low-level output functions.
