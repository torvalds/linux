.Fn xo_open_marker "const char *name"
.Ft int
.Fn xo_open_marker_h "xo_handle_t *handle" "const char *name"

.Fn  xo_close_marker_h "xo_handle_t *handle" "const char *name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm libxo
represents hierarchy using two constructs:
.Dq containers
and
.Dq lists .
A marker can be used to affect how open constructs are closed, either
by preventing their (implicit or explicit) closure or by forcing their
closure.
While a marker is open, no other open constructs can be closed. 
When a marker is closed, all constructs open since the marker was opened
will be closed.
A marker is used to "freeze" any open constructs.
Calls to
.Fn xo_close_*
functions that would normally close them will be ignored, effectively
blocking their closure.
However when
.Fn xo_close_marker
is called, any containers, lists, or leaf-lists open since the
matching
.Fn xo_open_marker
call will be close and the marker discarded.
Markers use names which are not user-visible, allowing the caller to
choose appropriate internal names.
The marker has no value and is not emitted in any form.
.Pp
To open a marker, call
.Fn xo_open_marker
or
.Fn xo_open_marker_h .
The former uses the default handle and
the latter accepts a specific handle.
.Pp
To close a marker, use the
.Fn xo_close_marker
or
.Fn xo_close_marker_h
functions.
.Pp
Each open call must have a matching close call.
.Pp
In this example, the
.Fn xo_close_container
call on line [1] will be ignored, since the open marker "outer"
will prevent close of any open constructs that precede it.
The
.Fn xo_close_marker
call on line [2] will close the "system" container, since it was
opened after the "outer" marker.

    Example:

        xo_open_container("top");
	xo_open_marker("outer");
        xo_open_container("system");
        xo_emit("{:host-name/%s%s%s", hostname,
                domainname ? "." : "", domainname ?: "");
        xo_close_container("top");   /* [1] */
	xo_close_marker("outer");    /* [2] */
        xo_close_container("top");
.Ed
.Pp
In this example, the code whiffles through a list of fish, calling a
function to emit details about each fish.  The marker "fish-guts" is
used to ensure that any constructs opened by the function are closed
properly.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
    for (i = 0; fish[i]; i++) {
        xo_open_instance("fish");
        xo_open_marker("fish-guts");
        dump_fish_details(i);
        xo_close_marker("fish-guts");
    }
