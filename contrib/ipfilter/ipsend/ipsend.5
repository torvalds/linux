.SH NAME
ipsend \- IP packet description language
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBipsend\fP program expects, with the \fB-L\fP option, input to be a
text file which fits the grammar described below.  The purpose of this
grammar is to allow IP packets to be described in an arbitary way which
also allows encapsulation to be so done to an arbitary level.

.SH COMMANDS
.PP
Before sending any packets or defining any packets, it is necessary to
describe the interface(s) which will be used to send packets out.
.TP
.B interface
is used to describe a network interface.  The description included need
not match the actual configuration currently employed by the operating
system.
.TP
.B send
is used to actually send out a packet across the network.  If the
destination is not specified, it will attempt to send the packet
directly out on the network to the destination without routing it.
.TP
.B router
configures the default router for ipsend, as distinct from the default
route installed in the kernel.
.TP
.B ipv4
is used to describe an IP (version 4) packet.  IP header fields can be
specified, including options, followed by a data section which may contain
further protocol headers.
.SH IPv4
.TP
.B hl <number>
manually specifies the IP header length (automatically adjusts with the
presence of IP options and defaults to 5);
.TP
.B v <number>
set the IP version.  Default is 4.
.TP
.B tos <number>
set the type of service (TOS) field in the IP header.  Default is 0.
.TP
.B len <number>
manually specifies the length of the IP packet.  The length will automatically
be adjusted to accommodate data or further protocol headers.
.TP
.B off <number>
sets the fragment offset field of the IP packet.  Default is 0.
.TP
.B ttl <number>
sets the time to live (TTL) field of the IP header.  Default is 60.
.TP
.B proto <protocol>
sets the protocol field of the IP header.  The protocol can either be a
number or a name found in \fB/etc/protocols\fP.
.TP
.B sum
manually specifies the checksum for the IP header.  If left unset (0), it
will be calculated prior to being sent.
.TP
.B src
manually specifies the source address of the IP header.  If left unset, it
will default to the host's IP address.
.TP
.B dst
sets the destination of the IP packet.  The default is 0.0.0.0.
.TP
.B opt
is used to include IP options in the IP header.
.TP
.B tcp
is used to indicate the a TCP protocol header is to follow.  See the \fBTCP\fP
section for TCP header options.
.TP
.B udp
is used to indicate the a UDP protocol header is to follow.  See the \fBUDP\fP
section for UDP header options.
.TP
.B icmp
is used to indicate the a ICMP protocol header is to follow.  See the
\fBICMP\fP section for ICMP header options.
.TP
.B data
is used to indicate that raw data is to be included in the IP packet.  See the
\fBDATA\fP section for details on options available.
.SH "IPv4 Options"
these keywords indicate that the relevant IP option should be added to the
IP header (the header length field will be adjusted appropriately).
.TP
.B nop
No Operation [RFC 791] (space filler).
.TP
.B rr <number>
Record Router [RFC 791].  The number given specifies the number of
\fBbytes\fP to be used for storage.  This should be a multiple of 4 for
proper operation.
.TP

.B ts
Timestamp [RFC 791].
.TP
.B tr
Traceroute [RFC 1393].
.TP
.B "sec-class <security-level>, sec"
Security [RFC 1108].  This option specifies the security label for the packet.
Using \fBsec\fP sets up the framework of the security option but unless
\fBsec-class\fP is given, the level may not be set.
.TP
.B "lsrr <ip-address>"
Loose Source Route [RFC 791].
.TP
.B e-sec

.SH TCP
.TP
.B sport <port>
sets the source port to the number/name given.  Default is 0.
.TP
.B dport <port>
sets the destination port to the number/name given.  Default is 0.
.TP
.B seq <number>
sets the sequence number to the number specified.  Default is 0.
.TP
.B ack <number>
sets the acknowledge number to the number specified.  Default is 0.
.TP
.B off <number>
sets the offset value for the start of data to the number specified.  This
implies the size of the TCP header.  It is automatically adjusted if TCP
options are included and defaults to 5.
.TP
.B urp <number>
sets the value of the urgent data pointer to the number specified.  Default
is 0.
.TP
.B win <number>
sets the size of the TCP window to the number specified.  Default is 4096.
.TP
.B sum <number>
manually specifies the checksum for the TCP pseudo-header and data.  If left
unset, it defaults to 0 and is automatically calculated.
.TP
.B flags <tcp-flags>
sets the TCP flags field to match the flags specified.  Valid flags are
"S" (SYN), "A" (ACK), "R" (RST), "F" (FIN), "U" (URG), "P" (PUSH).
.TP
.B opt
indicates that TCP header options follow.  As TCP options are added to the
TCP header, the \fBoff\fP field is updated to match.
.TP
.B data
indicates that a data section is to follow and is to be included as raw
data, being appended to the header.
.SH "TCP options"
With a TCP header, it is possible to append a number of header options.
The TCP header offset will be updated automatically to reflect the change
in size.  The valid options are: \fBnop\fP No Operation,
\fBeol\fP End Of (option) List, \fBmss [ size ]\fP Maximum Segment Size - this
sets the maximum receivable size of a packet containing data,
\fBwscale\fP Window Scale, \fBts\fP Timestamp.
.SH UDP
.TP

.TP
.B dport <port>
sets the destination port to the number/name given.  Default is 0.
.TP
.B len <number>
manually specifies the length of the UDP header and data.  If left unset,
it is automatically adjusted to match the header presence and any data if
present.
.TP
.B sum <number>
manually specifies the checksum for the UDP pseudo-header and data.  If left
unset, it defaults to 0 and is automatically calculated.
.TP
.B data
indicates that a data section is to follow and is to be included as raw
data, being appended to the header.
.SH ICMP
.TP
.B type <icmptype>
sets the ICMP type according the to the icmptype tag.  This may either be
a number or one of the recognised tags (see the \fBICMP TYPES\fP section for a
list of names recognised).
.TP
.B code <icmpcode>
sets the ICMP code.
.TP
.B data
indicates that a data section is to follow and is to be included as raw
data, being appended to the header.
.SH DATA
Each of the following extend the packet in a different way.  \fBLen\fP just
increases the length (without adding any content), \fBvalue\fP uses a string
and \fBfile\fP a file.
.TP
.B len <number>
extend the length of the packet by \fBnumber\fP bytes (without filling those
bytes with any particular data).
.TP
.B value <string>
indicates that the string provided should be added to the current packet as
data.  A string may be a consecutive list of characters and numbers (with
no white spaces) or bounded by "'s (may not contain them, even if \\'d).
The \\ character is recognised with the appropriate C escaped values, including
octal numbers.
.TP
.B file <filename>
reads data in from the specified file and appends it to the current packet.
If the new total length would exceed 64k, an error will be reported.
