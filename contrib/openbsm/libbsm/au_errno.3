.Sh NAME
.Nm au_bsm_to_errno ,
.Nm au_errno_to_bsm ,
.Nm au_strerror
.Nd "convert between BSM and local error numbers"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libbsm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In bsm/libbsm.h
.Ft int
.Fn au_bsm_to_errno "u_char bsm_error" "int *errorp"
.Ft u_char
.Fn au_errno_to_bsm "int error"
.Ft const char *
.Fn au_strerror "int bsm_error"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These interfaces may be used to convert between the local (
.Xr errno 2 )
and BSM error number spaces found in BSM return tokens.
.Pp
The
.Fn au_bsm_to_errno
function accepts a BSM error value,
.Fa bsm_error ,
and converts it to an
.Xr errno 2
that will be stored in the integer pointed to by
.Fa errorp
if successful.
This call will fail if the BSM error cannot be mapped into a local error
number, which may occur if the return token was generated on another
operating system.
.Pp
The
.Fn au_errno_to_bsm
function accepts a local
.Xr errno 2
value, and returns the BSM error number for it.
This call cannot fail, and instead returns a BSM error number indicating to
a later decoder that the error could not be encoded.
.Pp
The
.Fn au_strerror
function converts a BSM error value to a string, generally by converting first to a
local error number and using the local
.Xr strerror 3
function, but will also work for errors that are not locally defined.
.Sh RETURN VALULES
On success,
.Fn au_bsm_to_errno
returns 0 and a converted error value; on failure, it returns -1 but does not
set
.Xr errno 2 .
.Pp
On success,
.Fn au_strerror
returns a pointer to an error string; on failure it will return
.Dv NULL .

.Sh HISTORY
.Fn au_bsm_to_errno
and
.Fn au_errno_to_bsm
were introduced in OpenBSM 1.1.
.Sh AUTHORS
These functions were implemented by
.An Robert Watson
under contract to Apple Inc.
.Pp
The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit event
stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm au_strerror
is unable to provide localized strings for errors not available in the local
operating system.
