.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility selects records from the audit trail files based on the specified
criteria.
Matching audit records are printed to the standard output in
their raw binary form.
If no
.Ar file
argument is specified, the standard input is used
by default.
Use the
.Xr praudit 1
utility to print the selected audit records in human-readable form.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A
Select all records.
.It Fl a Ar YYYYMMDD Ns Op Ar HH Ns Op Ar MM Ns Op Ar SS
Select records that occurred after or on the given datetime.
.It Fl b Ar YYYYMMDD Ns Op Ar HH Ns Op Ar MM Ns Op Ar SS
Select records that occurred before the given datetime.
.It Fl c Ar flags
Select records matching the given audit classes specified as a comma
separated list of audit flags.
See
.Xr audit_control 5
for a description of audit flags.
.It Fl d Ar YYYYMMDD
Select records that occurred on a given date.
This option cannot be used with
.Fl a
or
.Fl b .
.It Fl e Ar euid
Select records with the given effective user ID or name.
.It Fl f Ar egid
Select records with the given effective group ID or name.
.It Fl g Ar rgid
Select records with the given real group ID or name.
.It Fl j Ar id
Select records having a subject token with matching ID, where ID is a process ID.
.It Fl m Ar event
Select records with the given event name or number. This option can
be used more then once to select records of multiple event types.
See
.Xr audit_event 5
for a description of audit event names and numbers.
.It Fl o Ar object Ns = Ns Ar value
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm msgqid"
.It Cm file
Select records containing path tokens, where the pathname matches
one of the comma delimited extended regular expression contained in
given specification.
Regular expressions which are prefixed with a tilde
.Pq Ql ~
are excluded
from the search results.
These extended regular expressions are processed from left to right,
and a path will either be selected or deslected based on the first match.
.Pp
Since commas are used to delimit the regular expressions, a backslash
.Pq Ql \e
character should be used to escape the comma if it is a part of the search
pattern.
.It Cm msgqid
Select records containing the given message queue ID.
.It Cm pid
Select records containing the given process ID.
.It Cm semid
Select records containing the given semaphore ID.
.It Cm shmid
Select records containing the given shared memory ID.
.El
.It Fl r Ar ruid
Select records with the given real user ID or name.
.It Fl u Ar auid
Select records with the given audit ID.
.It Fl v
Invert sense of matching, to select records that do not match.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To select all records associated with effective user ID root from the audit
log
.Pa /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
auditreduce -e root \e
    /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634
.Ed
.Pp
To select all
.Xr setlogin 2
events from that log:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
auditreduce -m AUE_SETLOGIN \e
    /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634
.Ed
.Pp
Output from the above command lines will typically be piped to a new trail
file, or via standard output to the
.Xr praudit 1
command.
.Pp
Select all records containing a path token where the pathname contains
.Pa /etc/master.passwd :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
auditreduce -o file="/etc/master.passwd" \e
    /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634
.Ed
.Pp
Select all records containing path tokens, where the pathname is a TTY
device:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
auditreduce -o file="/dev/tty[a-zA-Z][0-9]+" \e
    /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634
.Ed
.Pp
Select all records containing path tokens, where the pathname is a TTY
except for
.Pa /dev/ttyp2 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
auditreduce -o file="~/dev/ttyp2,/dev/tty[a-zA-Z][0-9]+" \e
    /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634
