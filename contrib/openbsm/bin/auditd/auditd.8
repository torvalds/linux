.Dt AUDITD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm auditd
.Nd audit log management daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d | l
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon responds to requests from the
.Xr audit 8
utility and notifications
from the kernel.
It manages the resulting audit log files and specified
log file locations.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Starts the daemon in debug mode \[em] it will not daemonize.
.It Fl l
This option is for when
.Nm
is configured to start on-demand using
.Xr launchd 8 .
.El
.Pp
Optionally, the audit review group "audit" may be created.
Non-privileged
users that are members of this group may read the audit trail log files.
.Sh NOTE
To assure uninterrupted audit support, the
.Nm
daemon should not be started and stopped manually.
Instead, the
.Xr audit 8
command
should be used to inform the daemon to change state/configuration after altering
the
.Pa audit_control
file.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is started on-demand by
.Xr launchd 8
then auditing should only be started and stopped with
.Xr audit 8 .
.Pp
On Mac OS X,
.Nm
uses the
.Xr asl 3
API for writing system log messages.
Therefore, only the audit administrator
and members of the audit review group will be able to read the
system log entries.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/security" -compact
.It Pa /var/audit
Default directory for storing audit log files.
.Pp
.It Pa /etc/security
The directory containing the auditing configuration files
.Xr audit_class 5 ,
.Xr audit_control 5 ,
.Xr audit_event 5 ,
and
.Xr audit_warn 5 .
.El
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The historical
.Fl h
and
.Fl s
flags are now configured using
.Xr audit_control 5
policy flags
.Cm ahlt
and
.Cm cnt ,
and are no longer available as arguments to
.Nm .

It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation for
the OpenBSM distribution.
