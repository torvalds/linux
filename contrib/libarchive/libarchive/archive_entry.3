.Dt ARCHIVE_ENTRY 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm archive_entry_clear ,
.Nm archive_entry_clone ,
.Nm archive_entry_free ,
.Nm archive_entry_new ,
.Nd functions for managing archive entry descriptions
.Sh LIBRARY
Streaming Archive Library (libarchive, -larchive)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In archive_entry.h
.Ft "struct archive_entry *"
.Fn archive_entry_clear "struct archive_entry *"
.Ft struct archive_entry *
.Fn archive_entry_clone "struct archive_entry *"
.Ft void
.Fn archive_entry_free "struct archive_entry *"
.Ft struct archive_entry *
.Fn archive_entry_new "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions create and manipulate data objects that
represent entries within an archive.
You can think of a
.Tn struct archive_entry
as a heavy-duty version of
.Tn struct stat :
it includes everything from
.Tn struct stat
plus associated pathname, textual group and user names, etc.
These objects are used by
.Xr libarchive 3
to represent the metadata associated with a particular
entry in an archive.
.Ss Create and Destroy
There are functions to allocate, destroy, clear, and copy
.Va archive_entry
objects:
.Bl -tag -compact -width indent
.It Fn archive_entry_clear
Erases the object, resetting all internal fields to the
same state as a newly-created object.
This is provided to allow you to quickly recycle objects
without thrashing the heap.
.It Fn archive_entry_clone
A deep copy operation; all text fields are duplicated.
.It Fn archive_entry_free
Releases the
.Tn struct archive_entry
object.
.It Fn archive_entry_new
Allocate and return a blank
.Tn struct archive_entry
object.
.El
.Ss Function groups
Due to high number of functions, the accessor functions can be found in
man pages grouped by the purpose.
.Bl -tag -width ".Xr archive_entry_perms 3"
.It Xr archive_entry_acl 3
Access Control List manipulation
.It Xr archive_entry_paths 3
Path name manipulation
.It Xr archive_entry_perms 3
User, group and mode manipulation
.It Xr archive_entry_stat 3
Functions not in the other groups and copying to/from
.Vt struct stat .
.It Xr archive_entry_time 3
Time field manipulation
.El
.Pp
Most of the functions set or read entries in an object.
Such functions have one of the following forms:
.Bl -tag -compact -width indent
.It Fn archive_entry_set_XXXX
Stores the provided data in the object.
In particular, for strings, the pointer is stored,
not the referenced string.
.It Fn archive_entry_copy_XXXX
As above, except that the referenced data is copied
into the object.
.It Fn archive_entry_XXXX
Returns the specified data.
In the case of strings, a const-qualified pointer to
the string is returned.
.El
String data can be set or accessed as wide character strings
or normal
.Va char
strings.
The functions that use wide character strings are suffixed with
.Cm _w .
Note that these are different representations of the same data:
For example, if you store a narrow string and read the corresponding
wide string, the object will transparently convert formats
using the current locale.
Similarly, if you store a wide string and then store a
narrow string for the same data, the previously-set wide string will
be discarded in favor of the new data.
