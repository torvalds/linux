This is the test harness for libarchive.

It compiles into a single program "libarchive_test" that is intended
to exercise as much of the library as possible.  It is, of course,
very much a work in progress.

Each test is a function named test_foo in a file named test_foo.c.
Note that the file name is the same as the function name.
Each file must start with this line:

  #include "test.h"

The test function must be declared with a line of this form

  DEFINE_TEST(test_foo)

Nothing else should appear on that line.

When you add a test, please update the top-level Makefile.am and the
CMakeLists.txt in this directory to add your file to the list of
tests.  The Makefile and main.c use various macro trickery to
automatically collect a list of test functions to be invoked.

Each test function can rely on the following:

  * The current directory will be a freshly-created empty directory
    suitable for that test.  (The top-level main() creates a
    directory for each separate test and chdir()s to that directory
    before running the test.)

  * The test function should use assert(), assertA() and similar macros
    defined in test.h.  If you need to add new macros of this form, feel
    free to do so.  The current macro set includes assertEqualInt() and
    assertEqualString() that print out additional detail about their
    arguments if the assertion does fail.  'A' versions also accept
    a struct archive * and display any error message from there on
    failure.

  * You are encouraged to document each assertion with a failure() call
    just before the assert.  The failure() function is a printf-like
    function whose text is displayed only if the assertion fails.  It
    can be used to display additional information relevant to the failure:

       failure("The data read from file %s did not match the data written to that file.", filename);
       assert(strcmp(buff1, buff2) == 0);

  * Tests are encouraged to be economical with their memory and disk usage,
    though this is not essential.  The test is occasionally run under
    a memory debugger to try to locate memory leaks in the library;
    as a result, tests should be careful to release any memory they
    allocate.

  * Disable tests on specific platforms as necessary.  Please avoid
    using config.h to adjust feature requirements, as I want the tests
    to also serve as a check on the configure process.  The following
    form is usually more appropriate:

#if !defined(__PLATFORM) && !defined(__Platform2__)
    assert(xxxx)
#endif
