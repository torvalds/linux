# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
# $ac_aux_dir to `$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
# `$srcdir', `$srcdir/..', or `$srcdir/../..'.
#
# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
#
# $ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
#
# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
#
# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
# and then we would define $MISSING as
#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
#
# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a
# configured tree to be moved without reconfiguration.

# ---------------
# Check whether `mkdir -p' is supported, fallback to mkinstalldirs otherwise.
#
# Automake 1.8 used `mkdir -m 0755 -p --' to ensure that directories
# created by `make install' are always world readable, even if the
# installer happens to have an overly restrictive umask (e.g. 077).
# This was a mistake.  There are at least two reasons why we must not
# use `-m 0755':
#   - it causes special bits like SGID to be ignored,
#   - it may be too restrictive (some setups expect 775 directories).
#
# Do not use -m 0755 and let people choose whatever they expect by
# setting umask.
#
# We cannot accept any implementation of `mkdir' that recognizes `-p'.
# Some implementations (such as Solaris 8's) are not thread-safe: if a
# parallel make tries to run `mkdir -p a/b' and `mkdir -p a/c'
# concurrently, both version can detect that a/ is missing, but only
# one can create it and the other will error out.  Consequently we
# restrict ourselves to GNU make (using the --version option ensures
# this.)

  # We used to keeping the `.' as first argument, in order to
  # allow $(mkdir_p) to be used without argument.  As in
  #   $(mkdir_p) $(somedir)
  # where $(somedir) is conditionally defined.  However this is wrong
  # for two reasons:
  #  1. if the package is installed by a user who cannot write `.'
  #     make install will fail,
  #  2. the above comment should most certainly read
  #     $(mkdir_p) $(DESTDIR)$(somedir)
  #     so it does not work when $(somedir) is undefined and
  #     $(DESTDIR) is not.
  #  To support the latter case, we have to write
  #     test -z "$(somedir)" || $(mkdir_p) $(DESTDIR)$(somedir),
  #  so the `.' trick is pointless.
