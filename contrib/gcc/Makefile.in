# On the use of stamps:
# Consider the example of tree-check.h. It is constructed with build/gencheck.
# A simple rule to build tree-check.h would be
# tree-check.h: build/gencheck$(build_exeext)
#	$(RUN_GEN) build/gencheck$(build_exeext) > tree-check.h
#
# but tree-check.h doesn't change every time gencheck changes. It would the
# nice if targets that depend on tree-check.h wouldn't be rebuild
# unnecessarily when tree-check.h is unchanged. To make this, tree-check.h
# must not be overwritten with a identical copy. One solution is to use a
# temporary file
# tree-check.h: build/gencheck$(build_exeext)
#	$(RUN_GEN) build/gencheck$(build_exeext) > tmp-check.h
#	$(SHELL) $(srcdir)/../move-if-change tmp-check.h tree-check.h
#
# This solution has a different problem. Since the time stamp of tree-check.h
# is unchanged, make will try to update tree-check.h every time it runs.
# To prevent this, one can add a stamp
# tree-check.h: s-check
# s-check : build/gencheck$(build_exeext)

# would never come up.  As it turns out, if you use ccache with
# CCACHE_HARDLINK enabled, the compiler doesn't embed the current
# working directory in object files (-g absent, or -fno-working-dir
# present), and build and host are the same, fixincl for the host will
# build after fixincl for the build machine, getting a cache hit,
# thereby updating the timestamp of fixincl.o in the host tree.
# Because of CCACHE_HARDLINK, this will also update the timestamp in

# These targets compare the object files in the current directory with
# those in a stage directory.  We need to skip the first N bytes of
# each object file.  The "slow" mechanism assumes nothing special
# about cmp and uses the tail command to skip.  ./ avoids a bug in
# some versions of tail.  The "gnu" targets use gnu cmp (diffutils
# v2.4 or later), to avoid running tail and the overhead of twice
# copying each object file.  Likewise, the "fast" targets use the skip
# parameter of cmp available on some systems to accomplish the same
# thing.  An exit status of 1 is precisely the result we're looking
# for (other values mean other problems).
