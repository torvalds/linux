/* The following code implements gcse after reload, the purpose of this
   pass is to cleanup redundant loads generated by reload and other
   optimizations that come after gcse. It searches for simple inter-block
   redundancies and tries to eliminate them by adding moves and loads
   in cold places.

   Perform partially redundant load elimination, try to eliminate redundant
   loads created by the reload pass.  We try to look for full or partial
   redundant loads fed by one or more loads/stores in predecessor BBs,
   and try adding loads to make them fully redundant.  We also check if
   it's worth adding loads to be able to delete the redundant load.

   Algorithm:
   1. Build available expressions hash table:
       For each load/store instruction, if the loaded/stored memory didn't
       change until the end of the basic block add this memory expression to
       the hash table.
   2. Perform Redundancy elimination:
      For each load instruction do the following:
	 perform partial redundancy elimination, check if it's worth adding
	 loads to make the load fully redundant.  If so add loads and
	 register copies and delete the load.
   3. Delete instructions made redundant in step 2.

   Future enhancement:
     If the loaded register is used/defined between load and some store,
     look for some other free register between load and all its stores,
     and replace the load with a copy from this register to the loaded
     register.
