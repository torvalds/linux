/* Before including this file, you should define a macro:

     DEF_BUILTIN (ENUM, NAME, CLASS, TYPE, LIBTYPE, BOTH_P,
                  FALLBACK_P, NONANSI_P, ATTRS, IMPLICIT, COND)

   This macro will be called once for each builtin function.  The
   ENUM will be of type `enum built_in_function', and will indicate
   which builtin function is being processed.  The NAME of the builtin
   function (which will always start with `__builtin_') is a string
   literal.  The CLASS is of type `enum built_in_class' and indicates
   what kind of builtin is being processed.

   Some builtins are actually two separate functions.  For example,
   for `strcmp' there are two builtin functions; `__builtin_strcmp'
   and `strcmp' itself.  Both behave identically.  Other builtins
   define only the `__builtin' variant.  If BOTH_P is TRUE, then this
   builtin has both variants; otherwise, it is has only the first
   variant.

   TYPE indicates the type of the function.  The symbols correspond to
   enumerals from builtin-types.def.  If BOTH_P is true, then LIBTYPE
   is the type of the non-`__builtin_' variant.  Otherwise, LIBTYPE
   should be ignored.

   If FALLBACK_P is true then, if for some reason, the compiler cannot
   expand the builtin function directly, it will call the
   corresponding library function (which does not have the
   `__builtin_' prefix.

   If NONANSI_P is true, then the non-`__builtin_' variant is not an
   ANSI/ISO library function, and so we should pretend it does not
   exist when compiling in ANSI conformant mode.

   ATTRs is an attribute list as defined in builtin-attrs.def that
   describes the attributes of this builtin function.

   IMPLICIT specifies condition when the builtin can be produced by
   compiler.  For instance C90 reserves floorf function, but does not
   define it's meaning.  When user uses floorf we may assume that the
   floorf has the meaning we expect, but we can't produce floorf by
   simplifying floor((double)float) since the runtime need not implement
   it.

   The builtins is registered only if COND is true.  */
