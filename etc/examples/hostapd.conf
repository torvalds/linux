# Macros
#

# Define macros for the interfaces to be used by hostapd. The "wlan"
# interface is optional.
wlan="ath0"
wired="sis0"

#
# Tables
#

# Define the MAC addresses (BSSIDs) for your accesspoints in a table.
table <myess> {
	00:90:4b:0d:fd:c8,
	00:02:6f:21:ea:8b

# Address masks are providing a simple way to match by MAC vendor ID.
#
# table <senao> { 00:02:6f:ff:ff:ff & ff:ff:ff:00:00:00 }

#
# Global options
#

# Comment this option to run hostapd in passive IAPP logging mode.
set hostap interface $wlan

# Use default radiotap mode.
set hostap mode radiotap

# Uncomment these options to jump to the next channel every 2 seconds.
#set hostap hopper interface $wlan
#set hostap hopper delay 2000

# Use multicast (according to the revised standard).
set iapp interface $wired
set iapp mode multicast

# The following mode is compatible to some pre-standard IAPP implementations
#set iapp mode broadcast port 2313

#
# Event rules
#

# Log probe requests.
hostap handle type management subtype probe request \
    with iapp type radiotap

# Log and annoy foreign accesspoints.
#
# This will be logged as well but the important thing is to
# annoy other accesspoints in your wireless territory.
hostap handle type data bssid !<myess> \
    with frame type management subtype deauth reason auth expire \
    from &bssid to ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff bssid &bssid

# The first de-auth example will not work with some newer stuff, like
# iwi(4)/ipw(4) "centrino", because they ignore management frames to
# the broadcast address as a countermeasure against the "void11"
# attack.

# hostap handle type data bssid !<myess> \
#    with frame type management subtype deauth reason auth expire \

# Detect flooding of management frames except beacons.
# This will detect some possible Denial of Service attacks
# against the IEEE 802.11 protocol (like "void11").
hostap handle skip type management subtype ! beacon \
    with log \
    rate 100 / 10 sec

# Finally log any rogue accesspoints limited to every second.
