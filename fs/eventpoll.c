/*
 * LOCKING:
 * There are three level of locking required by epoll :
 *
 * 1) epmutex (mutex)
 * 2) ep->mtx (mutex)
 * 3) ep->lock (spinlock)
 *
 * The acquire order is the one listed above, from 1 to 3.
 * We need a spinlock (ep->lock) because we manipulate objects
 * from inside the poll callback, that might be triggered from
 * a wake_up() that in turn might be called from IRQ context.
 * So we can't sleep inside the poll callback and hence we need
 * a spinlock. During the event transfer loop (from kernel to
 * user space) we could end up sleeping due a copy_to_user(), so
 * we need a lock that will allow us to sleep. This lock is a
 * mutex (ep->mtx). It is acquired during the event transfer loop,
 * during epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_DEL) and during eventpoll_release_file().
 * Then we also need a global mutex to serialize eventpoll_release_file()
 * and ep_free().
 * This mutex is acquired by ep_free() during the epoll file
 * cleanup path and it is also acquired by eventpoll_release_file()
 * if a file has been pushed inside an epoll set and it is then
 * close()d without a previous call to epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_DEL).
 * It is also acquired when inserting an epoll fd onto another epoll
 * fd. We do this so that we walk the epoll tree and ensure that this
 * insertion does not create a cycle of epoll file descriptors, which
 * could lead to deadlock. We need a global mutex to prevent two
 * simultaneous inserts (A into B and B into A) from racing and
 * constructing a cycle without either insert observing that it is
 * going to.
 * It is necessary to acquire multiple "ep->mtx"es at once in the
 * case when one epoll fd is added to another. In this case, we
 * always acquire the locks in the order of nesting (i.e. after
 * epoll_ctl(e1, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, e2), e1->mtx will always be acquired
 * before e2->mtx). Since we disallow cycles of epoll file
 * descriptors, this ensures that the mutexes are well-ordered. In
 * order to communicate this nesting to lockdep, when walking a tree
 * of epoll file descriptors, we use the current recursion depth as
 * the lockdep subkey.
 * It is possible to drop the "ep->mtx" and to use the global
 * mutex "epmutex" (together with "ep->lock") to have it working,
 * but having "ep->mtx" will make the interface more scalable.
 * Events that require holding "epmutex" are very rare, while for
 * normal operations the epoll private "ep->mtx" will guarantee
 * a better scalability.

 * As described in commit 0ccf831cb lockdep: annotate epoll
 * the use of wait queues used by epoll is done in a very controlled

 *
 *   dfd = socket(...);
 *   efd1 = epoll_create();
 *   efd2 = epoll_create();
 *   epoll_ctl(efd1, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, dfd, ...);
 *   epoll_ctl(efd2, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, efd1, ...);
 *
 * When a packet arrives to the device underneath "dfd", the net code will
 * issue a wake_up() on its poll wake list. Epoll (efd1) has installed a
 * callback wakeup entry on that queue, and the wake_up() performed by the
 * "dfd" net code will end up in ep_poll_callback(). At this point epoll
 * (efd1) notices that it may have some event ready, so it needs to wake up
 * the waiters on its poll wait list (efd2). So it calls ep_poll_safewake()
 * that ends up in another wake_up(), after having checked about the
 * recursion constraints. That are, no more than EP_MAX_POLLWAKE_NESTS, to
 * avoid stack blasting.
 *
 * When CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC is enabled, make sure lockdep can handle
