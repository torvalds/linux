	help
	  The automounter is a tool to automatically mount remote file systems
	  on demand. This implementation is partially kernel-based to reduce
	  overhead in the already-mounted case; this is unlike the BSD
	  automounter (amd), which is a pure user space daemon.

	  To use the automounter you need the user-space tools from
	  <https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/autofs/v4/>; you also
	  want to answer Y to "NFS file system support", below.

	  To compile this support as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called autofs4.  You will need to add "alias autofs autofs4" to your
	  modules configuration file.

	  If you are not a part of a fairly large, distributed network or
	  don't have a laptop which needs to dynamically reconfigure to the
	  local network, you probably do not need an automounter, and can say
	  N here.
