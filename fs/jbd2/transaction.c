 *
 * Any disk blocks which *are* part of the previous, committing
 * transaction (and which therefore cannot be discarded immediately) are
 * not going to be reused in the new running transaction
 *
 *  The bitmap committed_data images guarantee this: any block which is
 *  allocated in one transaction and removed in the next will be marked
 *  as in-use in the committed_data bitmap, so cannot be reused until
 *  the next transaction to delete the block commits.  This means that
 *  leaving committing buffers dirty is quite safe: the disk blocks
 *  cannot be reallocated to a different file and so buffer aliasing is
 *  not possible.
 *
 *
 * The above applies mainly to ordered data mode.  In writeback mode we
 * don't make guarantees about the order in which data hits disk --- in
 * particular we don't guarantee that new dirty data is flushed before
 * transaction commit --- so it is always safe just to discard data
