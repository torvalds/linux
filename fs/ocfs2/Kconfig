	  OCFS2 is a general purpose extent based shared disk cluster file
	  system with many similarities to ext3. It supports 64 bit inode
	  numbers, and has automatically extending metadata groups which may
	  also make it attractive for non-clustered use.

	  You'll want to install the ocfs2-tools package in order to at least
	  get "mount.ocfs2".

config OCFS2_FS_O2CB
	tristate "O2CB Kernelspace Clustering"
	depends on OCFS2_FS
	default y
	help
	  OCFS2 includes a simple kernelspace clustering package, the OCFS2
	  Cluster Base.  It only requires a very small userspace component
	  to configure it. This comes with the standard ocfs2-tools package.
	  O2CB is limited to maintaining a cluster for OCFS2 file systems.
	  It cannot manage any other cluster applications.

	  It is always safe to say Y here, as the clustering method is
	  run-time selectable.

config OCFS2_FS_USERSPACE_CLUSTER
	tristate "OCFS2 Userspace Clustering"
	depends on OCFS2_FS && DLM
	default y
	help
	  This option will allow OCFS2 to use userspace clustering services
	  in conjunction with the DLM in fs/dlm.  If you are using a
	  userspace cluster manager, say Y here.

	  It is safe to say Y, as the clustering method is run-time
	  selectable.

config OCFS2_FS_STATS
	bool "OCFS2 statistics"
	depends on OCFS2_FS && DEBUG_FS
	default y
	help
	  This option allows some fs statistics to be captured. Enabling
	  this option may increase the memory consumption.

config OCFS2_DEBUG_MASKLOG
	bool "OCFS2 logging support"
	depends on OCFS2_FS
	default y
	help
	  The ocfs2 filesystem has an extensive logging system.  The system
	  allows selection of events to log via files in /sys/o2cb/logmask/.
	  This option will enlarge your kernel, but it allows debugging of
	  ocfs2 filesystem issues.

config OCFS2_DEBUG_FS
	bool "OCFS2 expensive checks"
	depends on OCFS2_FS
	default n
	help
	  This option will enable expensive consistency checks. Enable
	  this option for debugging only as it is likely to decrease
	  performance of the filesystem.
