/* If invalidate_buffers() will trash dirty buffers, it means some kind
   of fs corruption is going on. Trashing dirty data always imply losing
   information that was supposed to be just stored on the physical layer
   by the user.

   Thus invalidate_buffers in general usage is not allwowed to trash
   dirty buffers. For example ioctl(FLSBLKBUF) expects dirty data to
   be preserved.  These buffers are simply skipped.
  
   We also skip buffers which are still in use.  For example this can
   happen if a userspace program is reading the block device.

   NOTE: In the case where the user removed a removable-media-disk even if
   there's still dirty data not synced on disk (due a bug in the device driver
   or due an error of the user), by not destroying the dirty buffers we could
   generate corruption also on the next media inserted, thus a parameter is
   necessary to handle this case in the most safe way possible (trying
   to not corrupt also the new disk inserted with the data belonging to
   the old now corrupted disk). Also for the ramdisk the natural thing
   to do in order to release the ramdisk memory is to destroy dirty buffers.

   These are two special cases. Normal usage imply the device driver
   to issue a sync on the device (without waiting I/O completion) and
   then an invalidate_buffers call that doesn't trash dirty buffers.

   For handling cache coherency with the blkdev pagecache the 'update' case
   is been introduced. It is needed to re-read from disk any pinned
   buffer. NOTE: re-reading from disk is destructive so we can do it only
   when we assume nobody is changing the buffercache under our I/O and when
   we think the disk contains more recent information than the buffercache.
   The update == 1 pass marks the buffers we need to update, the update == 2
   pass does the actual I/O. */

/*
 * fs/buffer.c contains helper functions for buffer-backed address space's

 * that certain data from the backing blockdev needs to be written out for
 * a successful fsync().  For example, ext2 indirect blocks need to be
 * written back and waited upon before fsync() returns.
 *
 * The functions mark_buffer_inode_dirty(), fsync_inode_buffers(),
 * inode_has_buffers() and invalidate_inode_buffers() are provided for the
 * management of a list of dependent buffers at ->i_mapping->private_list.
 *
 * Locking is a little subtle: try_to_free_buffers() will remove buffers
 * from their controlling inode's queue when they are being freed.  But
 * try_to_free_buffers() will be operating against the *blockdev* mapping
 * at the time, not against the S_ISREG file which depends on those buffers.
 * So the locking for private_list is via the private_lock in the address_space
 * which backs the buffers.  Which is different from the address_space 
 * against which the buffers are listed.  So for a particular address_space,
 * mapping->private_lock does *not* protect mapping->private_list!  In fact,
 * mapping->private_list will always be protected by the backing blockdev's
 * ->private_lock.
 *
 * Which introduces a requirement: all buffers on an address_space's
 * ->private_list must be from the same address_space: the blockdev's.
 *
 * address_spaces which do not place buffers at ->private_list via these
 * utility functions are free to use private_lock and private_list for
 * whatever they want.  The only requirement is that list_empty(private_list)
 * be true at clear_inode() time.
 *
 * FIXME: clear_inode should not call invalidate_inode_buffers().  The
 * filesystems should do that.  invalidate_inode_buffers() should just go
 * BUG_ON(!list_empty).
 *
 * FIXME: mark_buffer_dirty_inode() is a data-plane operation.  It should
 * take an address_space, not an inode.  And it should be called
 * mark_buffer_dirty_fsync() to clearly define why those buffers are being
 * queued up.
 *
 * FIXME: mark_buffer_dirty_inode() doesn't need to add the buffer to the
 * list if it is already on a list.  Because if the buffer is on a list,
 * it *must* already be on the right one.  If not, the filesystem is being
 * silly.  This will save a ton of locking.  But first we have to ensure
 * that buffers are taken *off* the old inode's list when they are freed
 * (presumably in truncate).  That requires careful auditing of all
 * filesystems (do it inside bforget()).  It could also be done by bringing
 * b_inode back.

 * Do this in two main stages: first we copy dirty buffers to a
 * temporary inode list, queueing the writes as we go.  Then we clean
 * up, waiting for those writes to complete.
 * 
 * During this second stage, any subsequent updates to the file may end
 * up refiling the buffer on the original inode's dirty list again, so
 * there is a chance we will end up with a buffer queued for write but
 * not yet completed on that list.  So, as a final cleanup we go through
 * the osync code to catch these locked, dirty buffers without requeuing
 * any newly dirty buffers for write.

 * filesystem data on the same device.
 *
 * The same applies to regular filesystem pages: if all the buffers are
 * clean then we set the page clean and proceed.  To do that, we require
 * total exclusion from __set_page_dirty_buffers().  That is obtained with
 * private_lock.
