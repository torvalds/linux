/*
 * I/O completion handler for multipage BIOs.
 *
 * The mpage code never puts partial pages into a BIO (except for end-of-file).
 * If a page does not map to a contiguous run of blocks then it simply falls
 * back to block_read_full_page().
 *
 * Why is this?  If a page's completion depends on a number of different BIOs
 * which can complete in any order (or at the same time) then determining the
 * status of that page is hard.  See end_buffer_async_read() for the details.
 * There is no point in duplicating all that complexity.

/**
 * mpage_readpages - populate an address space with some pages, and
 *                       start reads against them.
 *
 * @mapping: the address_space
 * @pages: The address of a list_head which contains the target pages.  These
 *   pages have their ->index populated and are otherwise uninitialised.
 *
 *   The page at @pages->prev has the lowest file offset, and reads should be
 *   issued in @pages->prev to @pages->next order.
 *
 * @nr_pages: The number of pages at *@pages
 * @get_block: The filesystem's block mapper function.
 *
 * This function walks the pages and the blocks within each page, building and
 * emitting large BIOs.
 *
 * If anything unusual happens, such as:
 *
 * - encountering a page which has buffers
 * - encountering a page which has a non-hole after a hole
 * - encountering a page with non-contiguous blocks
 *
 * then this code just gives up and calls the buffer_head-based read function.
 * It does handle a page which has holes at the end - that is a common case:
 * the end-of-file on blocksize < PAGE_CACHE_SIZE setups.
 *
 * BH_Boundary explanation:
 *
 * There is a problem.  The mpage read code assembles several pages, gets all
 * their disk mappings, and then submits them all.  That's fine, but obtaining
 * the disk mappings may require I/O.  Reads of indirect blocks, for example.
 *
 * So an mpage read of the first 16 blocks of an ext2 file will cause I/O to be
 * submitted in the following order:
 * 	12 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 13 14 15 16
 * because the indirect block has to be read to get the mappings of blocks
 * 13,14,15,16.  Obviously, this impacts performance.
 *
 * So what we do it to allow the filesystem's get_block() function to set
 * BH_Boundary when it maps block 11.  BH_Boundary says: mapping of the block
 * after this one will require I/O against a block which is probably close to
 * this one.  So you should push what I/O you have currently accumulated.
 *
 * This all causes the disk requests to be issued in the correct order.
