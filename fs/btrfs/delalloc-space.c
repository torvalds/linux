/*
 * HOW DOES THIS WORK
 *
 * There are two stages to data reservations, one for data and one for metadata
 * to handle the new extents and checksums generated by writing data.
 *
 *
 * DATA RESERVATION
 *   The general flow of the data reservation is as follows
 *
 *   -> Reserve
 *     We call into btrfs_reserve_data_bytes() for the user request bytes that
 *     they wish to write.  We make this reservation and add it to
 *     space_info->bytes_may_use.  We set EXTENT_DELALLOC on the inode io_tree
 *     for the range and carry on if this is buffered, or follow up trying to
 *     make a real allocation if we are pre-allocating or doing O_DIRECT.
 *
 *   -> Use
 *     At writepages()/prealloc/O_DIRECT time we will call into
 *     btrfs_reserve_extent() for some part or all of this range of bytes.  We
 *     will make the allocation and subtract space_info->bytes_may_use by the
 *     original requested length and increase the space_info->bytes_reserved by
 *     the allocated length.  This distinction is important because compression
 *     may allocate a smaller on disk extent than we previously reserved.
 *
 *   -> Allocation
 *     finish_ordered_io() will insert the new file extent item for this range,
 *     and then add a delayed ref update for the extent tree.  Once that delayed
 *     ref is written the extent size is subtracted from
 *     space_info->bytes_reserved and added to space_info->bytes_used.
 *
 *   Error handling
 *
 *   -> By the reservation maker
 *     This is the simplest case, we haven't completed our operation and we know
 *     how much we reserved, we can simply call
 *     btrfs_free_reserved_data_space*() and it will be removed from
 *     space_info->bytes_may_use.
 *
 *   -> After the reservation has been made, but before cow_file_range()
 *     This is specifically for the delalloc case.  You must clear
 *     EXTENT_DELALLOC with the EXTENT_CLEAR_DATA_RESV bit, and the range will
 *     be subtracted from space_info->bytes_may_use.
 *
 * METADATA RESERVATION
 *   The general metadata reservation lifetimes are discussed elsewhere, this
 *   will just focus on how it is used for delalloc space.
 *
 *   We keep track of two things on a per inode bases
 *
 *   ->outstanding_extents
 *     This is the number of file extent items we'll need to handle all of the
 *     outstanding DELALLOC space we have in this inode.  We limit the maximum
 *     size of an extent, so a large contiguous dirty area may require more than
 *     one outstanding_extent, which is why count_max_extents() is used to
 *     determine how many outstanding_extents get added.
 *
 *   ->csum_bytes
 *     This is essentially how many dirty bytes we have for this inode, so we
 *     can calculate the number of checksum items we would have to add in order
 *     to checksum our outstanding data.
 *
 *   We keep a per-inode block_rsv in order to make it easier to keep track of
 *   our reservation.  We use btrfs_calculate_inode_block_rsv_size() to
 *   calculate the current theoretical maximum reservation we would need for the
 *   metadata for this inode.  We call this and then adjust our reservation as
 *   necessary, either by attempting to reserve more space, or freeing up excess
 *   space.
 *
 * OUTSTANDING_EXTENTS HANDLING
 *
 *  ->outstanding_extents is used for keeping track of how many extents we will
 *  need to use for this inode, and it will fluctuate depending on where you are
 *  in the life cycle of the dirty data.  Consider the following normal case for
 *  a completely clean inode, with a num_bytes < our maximum allowed extent size
 *
 *  -> reserve
 *    ->outstanding_extents += 1 (current value is 1)
 *
 *  -> set_delalloc
 *    ->outstanding_extents += 1 (current value is 2)
 *
 *  -> btrfs_delalloc_release_extents()
 *    ->outstanding_extents -= 1 (current value is 1)
 *
 *    We must call this once we are done, as we hold our reservation for the
 *    duration of our operation, and then assume set_delalloc will update the
 *    counter appropriately.
 *
 *  -> add ordered extent
 *    ->outstanding_extents += 1 (current value is 2)
 *
 *  -> btrfs_clear_delalloc_extent
 *    ->outstanding_extents -= 1 (current value is 1)
 *
 *  -> finish_ordered_io/btrfs_remove_ordered_extent
 *    ->outstanding_extents -= 1 (current value is 0)
 *
 *  Each stage is responsible for their own accounting of the extent, thus
 *  making error handling and cleanup easier.
