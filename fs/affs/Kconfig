	  The Fast File System (FFS) is the common file system used on hard
	  disks by Amiga(tm) systems since AmigaOS Version 1.3 (34.20).  Say Y
	  if you want to be able to read and write files from and to an Amiga
	  FFS partition on your hard drive.  Amiga floppies however cannot be
	  read with this driver due to an incompatibility of the floppy
	  controller used in an Amiga and the standard floppy controller in
	  PCs and workstations. Read <file:Documentation/filesystems/affs.txt>
	  and <file:fs/affs/Changes>.

	  With this driver you can also mount disk files used by Bernd
	  Schmidt's Un*X Amiga Emulator
	  (<http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~uae/>).
	  If you want to do this, you will also need to say Y or M to "Loop
	  device support", above.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called affs.  If unsure, say N.
