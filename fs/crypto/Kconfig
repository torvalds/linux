	  Enable encryption of files and directories.  This
	  feature is similar to ecryptfs, but it is more memory
	  efficient since it avoids caching the encrypted and
	  decrypted pages in the page cache.  Currently Ext4,
	  F2FS, UBIFS, and CephFS make use of this feature.

# Filesystems supporting encryption must select this if FS_ENCRYPTION.  This
# allows the algorithms to be built as modules when all the filesystems are,
# whereas selecting them from FS_ENCRYPTION would force them to be built-in.
#
# Note: this option only pulls in the algorithms that filesystem encryption
# needs "by default".  If userspace will use "non-default" encryption modes such
# as Adiantum encryption, then those other modes need to be explicitly enabled
# in the crypto API; see Documentation/filesystems/fscrypt.rst for details.
#
# Also note that this option only pulls in the generic implementations of the
# algorithms, not any per-architecture optimized implementations.  It is
# strongly recommended to enable optimized implementations too.  It is safe to
# disable these generic implementations if corresponding optimized
# implementations will always be available too; for this reason, these are soft
# dependencies ('imply' rather than 'select').  Only disable these generic
# implementations if you're sure they will never be needed, though.
