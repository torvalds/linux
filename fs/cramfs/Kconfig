	  Saying Y here includes support for CramFs (Compressed ROM File
	  System).  CramFs is designed to be a simple, small, and compressed
	  file system for ROM based embedded systems.  CramFs is read-only,
	  limited to 256MB file systems (with 16MB files), and doesn't support
	  16/32 bits uid/gid, hard links and timestamps.

	  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/cramfs.txt> and
	  <file:fs/cramfs/README> for further information.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called
	  cramfs.  Note that the root file system (the one containing the
	  directory /) cannot be compiled as a module.

	  This filesystem is obsoleted by SquashFS, which is much better
	  in terms of performance and features.

	  If unsure, say N.
