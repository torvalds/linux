	  This file system is often called HFS+ and was introduced with
	  MacOS 8. It includes all Mac specific filesystem data such as
	  data forks and creator codes, but it also has several UNIX
	  style features such as file ownership and permissions.

	  This builds KUnit tests for the HFS+ filesystem.

	  KUnit tests run during boot and output the results to the debug
	  log in TAP format (https://testanything.org/). Only useful for
	  kernel devs running KUnit test harness and are not for inclusion
	  into a production build.

	  For more information on KUnit and unit tests in general please
	  refer to the KUnit documentation in Documentation/dev-tools/kunit/.
