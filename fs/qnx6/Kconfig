	  This is the file system used by the real-time operating systems
	  QNX 6 (also called QNX RTP).
	  Further information is available at <http://www.qnx.com/>.
	  Say Y if you intend to mount QNX hard disks or floppies formatted
          with a mkqnx6fs.
	  However, keep in mind that this currently is a readonly driver!

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called qnx6.

	  If you don't know whether you need it, then you don't need it:
	  answer N.

config QNX6FS_DEBUG
	bool "QNX6 debugging information"
	depends on QNX6FS_FS
	help
	  Turns on extended debugging output.

	  If you are not a developer working on the QNX6FS, you probably don't
	  want this:
	  answer N.
