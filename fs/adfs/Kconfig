	  The Acorn Disc Filing System is the standard file system of the
	  RiscOS operating system which runs on Acorn's ARM-based Risc PC
	  systems and the Acorn Archimedes range of machines. If you say Y
	  here, Linux will be able to read from ADFS partitions on hard drives
	  and from ADFS-formatted floppy discs. If you also want to be able to
	  write to those devices, say Y to "ADFS write support" below.

	  The ADFS partition should be the first partition (i.e.,
	  /dev/[hs]d?1) on each of your drives. Please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/adfs.rst> for further details.

	  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called adfs.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  If you say Y here, you will be able to write to ADFS partitions on
