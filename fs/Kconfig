config EXT3_FS

	help
	  This is the journalling version of the Second extended file system
	  (often called ext3), the de facto standard Linux file system
	  (method to organize files on a storage device) for hard disks.

	  The journalling code included in this driver means you do not have
	  to run e2fsck (file system checker) on your file systems after a
	  crash.  The journal keeps track of any changes that were being made
	  at the time the system crashed, and can ensure that your file system
	  is consistent without the need for a lengthy check.

	  Other than adding the journal to the file system, the on-disk format
	  of ext3 is identical to ext2.  It is possible to freely switch
	  between using the ext3 driver and the ext2 driver, as long as the
	  file system has been cleanly unmounted, or e2fsck is run on the file
	  system.

	  To add a journal on an existing ext2 file system or change the
	  behavior of ext3 file systems, you can use the tune2fs utility ("man
	  tune2fs").  To modify attributes of files and directories on ext3
	  file systems, use chattr ("man chattr").  You need to be using
	  e2fsprogs version 1.20 or later in order to create ext3 journals
	  (available at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/e2fsprogs/>).

	  extended fs ext4, based on ext3 filesystem code. It will be

	  Unlike the change from ext2 filesystem to ext3 filesystem,
	  the on-disk format of ext4dev is not the same as ext3 any more:
	  it is based on extent maps and it supports 48-bit physical block
	  numbers. These combined on-disk format changes will allow
	  ext4dev/ext4 to handle more than 16 TB filesystem volumes --
	  a hard limit that ext3 cannot overcome without changing the
	  on-disk format.

	  Other than extent maps and 48-bit block numbers, ext4dev also is

	  If you want to use one of the FAT-based file systems (the MS-DOS and

	  to include FAT support. You will then be able to mount partitions or
	  diskettes with FAT-based file systems and transparently access the
	  files on them, i.e. MSDOS files will look and behave just like all
	  other Unix files.

	  This FAT support is not a file system in itself, it only provides
	  the foundation for the other file systems. You will have to say Y or
	  M to at least one of "MSDOS fs support" or "VFAT fs support" in
	  order to make use of it.

	  Another way to read and write MSDOS floppies and hard drive
	  partitions from within Linux (but not transparently) is with the
	  mtools ("man mtools") program suite. You don't need to say Y here in
	  order to do that.

	  If you need to move large files on floppies between a DOS and a
	  Linux box, say Y here, mount the floppy under Linux with an MSDOS
	  file system and use GNU tar's M option. GNU tar is a program
	  available for Unix and DOS ("man tar" or "info tar").

	  The FAT support will enlarge your kernel by about 37 KB. If unsure,
	  say Y.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called

	  from the project web site.

	  For more information see <file:Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt>

	  disabled by default.  To enable them, supply the option debug_msgs=1
	  at the kernel command line when booting the kernel or as an option
	  to insmod when loading the ntfs module.  Once the driver is active,
	  you can enable debugging messages by doing (as root):
	  echo 1 > /proc/sys/fs/ntfs-debug
	  Replacing the "1" with "0" would disable debug messages.

	  If you leave debugging messages disabled, this results in little
	  overhead, but enabling debug messages results in very significant

	  When reporting bugs, please try to have available a full dump of
	  debugging messages while the misbehaviour was occurring.

config NTFS_RW
	bool "NTFS write support"
	depends on NTFS_FS
	help
	  This enables the partial, but safe, write support in the NTFS driver.

	  The only supported operation is overwriting existing files, without
	  changing the file length.  No file or directory creation, deletion or
	  renaming is possible.  Note only non-resident files can be written to
	  so you may find that some very small files (<500 bytes or so) cannot
	  be written to.

	  While we cannot guarantee that it will not damage any data, we have
	  so far not received a single report where the driver would have
	  damaged someones data so we assume it is perfectly safe to use.

	  Note:  While write support is safe in this version (a rewrite from
	  scratch of the NTFS support), it should be noted that the old NTFS
	  write support, included in Linux 2.5.10 and before (since 1997),
	  is not safe.

	  This is currently useful with TopologiLinux.  TopologiLinux is run
	  on top of any DOS/Microsoft Windows system without partitioning your

	  Unless your program is designed to use O_DIRECT properly, you are

	  For more details on NFS O_DIRECT, see fs/nfs/direct.c.

	    unsure, say N.

config NCP_FS
	tristate "NCP file system support (to mount NetWare volumes)"
	depends on IPX!=n || INET
	help
	  NCP (NetWare Core Protocol) is a protocol that runs over IPX and is
	  used by Novell NetWare clients to talk to file servers.  It is to
	  IPX what NFS is to TCP/IP, if that helps.  Saying Y here allows you
	  to mount NetWare file server volumes and to access them just like
	  any other Unix directory.  For details, please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/ncpfs.txt> in the kernel source and
	  the IPX-HOWTO from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  You do not have to say Y here if you want your Linux box to act as a
	  file *server* for Novell NetWare clients.

	  General information about how to connect Linux, Windows machines and
	  Macs is on the WWW at <http://www.eats.com/linux_mac_win.html>.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called
	  ncpfs.  Say N unless you are connected to a Novell network.

config CODA_FS
	tristate "Coda file system support (advanced network fs)"
	depends on INET
	help
	  Coda is an advanced network file system, similar to NFS in that it
	  enables you to mount file systems of a remote server and access them
	  with regular Unix commands as if they were sitting on your hard
	  disk.  Coda has several advantages over NFS: support for
	  disconnected operation (e.g. for laptops), read/write server
	  replication, security model for authentication and encryption,
	  persistent client caches and write back caching.

	  If you say Y here, your Linux box will be able to act as a Coda
	  *client*.  You will need user level code as well, both for the
	  client and server.  Servers are currently user level, i.e. they need
	  no kernel support.  Please read
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/coda.txt> and check out the Coda
	  home page <http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/>.

	  To compile the coda client support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called coda.

config CODA_FS_OLD_API
	bool "Use 96-bit Coda file identifiers"
	depends on CODA_FS
	help
	  A new kernel-userspace API had to be introduced for Coda v6.0
	  to support larger 128-bit file identifiers as needed by the
	  new realms implementation.

	  However this new API is not backward compatible with older
	  clients. If you really need to run the old Coda userspace
	  cache manager then say Y.
	  
	  For most cases you probably want to say N.

config AFS_FS
	tristate "Andrew File System support (AFS) (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on INET && EXPERIMENTAL
	select AF_RXRPC
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will get an experimental Andrew File System
	  driver. It currently only supports unsecured read-only AFS access.

	  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/afs.txt> for more information.

	  If unsure, say N.

config AFS_DEBUG
	bool "AFS dynamic debugging"
	depends on AFS_FS
	help
	  Say Y here to make runtime controllable debugging messages appear.

	  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/afs.txt> for more information.

	  If unsure, say N.

config 9P_FS
	tristate "Plan 9 Resource Sharing Support (9P2000) (Experimental)"
	depends on INET && NET_9P && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will get experimental support for
	  Plan 9 resource sharing via the 9P2000 protocol.

	  See <http://v9fs.sf.net> for more information.

	  If unsure, say N.
