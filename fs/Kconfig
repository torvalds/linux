config QUOTA
	bool "Quota support"
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will be able to set per user limits for disk
	  usage (also called disk quotas). Currently, it works for the
	  ext2, ext3, and reiserfs file system. ext3 also supports journalled
	  quotas for which you don't need to run quotacheck(8) after an unclean
	  shutdown.
	  For further details, read the Quota mini-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, or the documentation provided
	  with the quota tools. Probably the quota support is only useful for
	  multi user systems. If unsure, say N.

	  Tmpfs is a file system which keeps all files in virtual memory.

	  Everything in tmpfs is temporary in the sense that no files will be
	  created on your hard drive. The files live in memory and swap
	  space. If you unmount a tmpfs instance, everything stored therein is
	  lost.
