	A cluster filesystem.

	Allows a cluster of computers to simultaneously use a block device
	that is shared between them (with FC, iSCSI, NBD, etc...).  GFS reads
	and writes to the block device like a local filesystem, but also uses
	a lock module to allow the computers coordinate their I/O so
	filesystem consistency is maintained.  One of the nifty features of
	GFS is perfect consistency -- changes made to the filesystem on one
	machine show up immediately on all other machines in the cluster.

	To use the GFS2 filesystem, you will need to enable one or more of
	the below locking modules. Documentation and utilities for GFS2 can
	be found here: http://sources.redhat.com/cluster

config GFS2_FS_LOCKING_NOLOCK
	tristate "GFS2 \"nolock\" locking module"
	depends on GFS2_FS
	help
	Single node locking module for GFS2.

	Use this module if you want to use GFS2 on a single node without
	its clustering features. You can still take advantage of the
	large file support, and upgrade to running a full cluster later on
	if required.

	If you will only be using GFS2 in cluster mode, you do not need this
	module.

config GFS2_FS_LOCKING_DLM
	tristate "GFS2 DLM locking module"
	depends on GFS2_FS
	select DLM
	help
	Multiple node locking module for GFS2

	Most users of GFS2 will require this module. It provides the locking
	interface between GFS2 and the DLM, which is required to use GFS2
	in a cluster environment.
