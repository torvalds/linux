	  EFS is an older file system used for non-ISO9660 CD-ROMs and hard
	  disk partitions by SGI's IRIX operating system (IRIX 6.0 and newer
	  uses the XFS file system for hard disk partitions however).

	  This implementation only offers read-only access. If you don't know
	  what all this is about, it's safe to say N. For more information
	  about EFS see its home page at <http://aeschi.ch.eu.org/efs/>.

	  To compile the EFS file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called efs.
