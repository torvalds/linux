	  FreeVxFS is a file system driver that support the VERITAS VxFS(TM)
	  file system format.  VERITAS VxFS(TM) is the standard file system
	  of SCO UnixWare (and possibly others) and optionally available
	  for Sunsoft Solaris, HP-UX and many other operating systems. However
	  these particular OS implementations of vxfs may differ in on-disk
	  data endianess and/or superblock offset. The vxfs module has been
	  tested with SCO UnixWare and HP-UX B.10.20 (pa-risc 1.1 arch.)
	  Currently only readonly access is supported and VxFX versions
	  2, 3 and 4. Tests were performed with HP-UX VxFS version 3.

	  NOTE: the file system type as used by mount(1), mount(2) and
	  fstab(5) is 'vxfs' as it describes the file system format, not
	  the actual driver.

	  There is a userspace utility for HP-UX logical volumes which makes
	  creating HP-UX logical volumes easy from HP-UX disk block device file
	  or regular file with image of the disk. See:
	         https://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-vxfs/

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called freevxfs.  If unsure, say N.
