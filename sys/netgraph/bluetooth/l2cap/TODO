FIXME/TODO list

0) Ping itself. Should L2CAP layer loopback data?

1) Locking/SMP

	External code now uses ng_send_fn to inject data into Netgraph, so
	it should be fine as long as Netgraph is SMP safe. Just need to
	verify it.

2) Understand and implement L2CAP QoS

	Will fix later. I only have CSR based hardware and it does not
	support QoS.

3) Better functions to manage CIDs and command ident's.

	Resource manager is not good because it uses MTX_DEF mutexes,
	(i.e. could block/sleep)

4) Implement group channels (multicast)

	Will fix later

5) Add bytes/packets counters and commands to get/reset them

	Will fix later. What to count?

6) Better way to get information about channels

	L2CAP can support about 65000 channels. Need define some good way
	to get data from kernel to user space. For example if we need to pass
	1K of information for every channel, then worst case is that we need
	to pass 65Mbytes of data from kernel to user space. Not good.

7) Deal properly with "shutdown"s and hook "disconnect"s

	For now we destroy all channels when upstream hook is disconnected.
	Is there a better way to handle this?
