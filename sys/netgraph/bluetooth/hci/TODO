FIXME/TODO list

This is a list of open issues for HCI node

1) Locking/SMP

	External code now uses ng_send_fn to inject data into Netgraph, so
	it should be fine as long as Netgraph is SMP safe. Just need to 
	verify it.

2) HCI QoS handling

	Some code exists, but i have no idea how it should work. Will 
	understand and fix later. I only have CSR based hardware and
	it does not support QoS.

3) Add proper handling for some HCI commands

	HCI testing commands is one example. Also might implement Host to 
	Host Controller flow control (not sure if it is required).

4) Code cleanup

	Verify return codes from functions
	Remove some waringns/errors
