# NOTES -- Lines that can be cut/pasted into kernel and hints configs.
#
# Lines that begin with 'device', 'options', 'machine', 'ident', 'maxusers',
# 'makeoptions', 'hints', etc. go into the kernel configuration that you
# run config(8) with.
#
# Lines that begin with 'hint.' are NOT for config(8), they go into your
# hints file.  See /boot/device.hints and/or the 'hints' config(8) directive.
#
# Please use ``make LINT'' to create an old-style LINT file if you want to
# do kernel test-builds.
#
# This file contains machine independent kernel configuration notes.  For
# machine dependent notes, look in /sys/<arch>/conf/NOTES.
#

#
# NOTES conventions and style guide:
#
# Large block comments should begin and end with a line containing only a
# comment character.
#
# To describe a particular object, a block comment (if it exists) should
# come first.  Next should come device, options, and hints lines in that
# order.  All device and option lines must be described by a comment that
# doesn't just expand the device or option name.  Use only a concise
# comment on the same line if possible.  Very detailed descriptions of
# devices and subsystems belong in man pages.
#
# A space followed by a tab separates 'options' from an option name.  Two
# spaces followed by a tab separate 'device' from a device name.  Comments
# after an option or device should use one space after the comment character.
# To comment out a negative option that disables code and thus should not be
# enabled for LINT builds, precede 'options' with "#!".
#

#
# This is the ``identification'' of the kernel.  Usually this should
# be the same as the name of your kernel.
#
ident		LINT

#
# The `maxusers' parameter controls the static sizing of a number of
# internal system tables by a formula defined in subr_param.c.
# Omitting this parameter or setting it to 0 will cause the system to
# auto-size based on physical memory.
#
maxusers	10

# To statically compile in device wiring instead of /boot/device.hints
#hints		"LINT.hints"		# Default places to look for devices.

# Use the following to compile in values accessible to the kernel
# through getenv() (or kenv(1) in userland). The format of the file
# is 'variable=value', see kenv(1)
#
#env		"LINT.env"

#
# The `makeoptions' parameter allows variables to be passed to the
# generated Makefile in the build area.
#
# CONF_CFLAGS gives some extra compiler flags that are added to ${CFLAGS}
# after most other flags.  Here we use it to inhibit use of non-optimal
# gcc built-in functions (e.g., memcmp).
#
# DEBUG happens to be magic.
# The following is equivalent to 'config -g KERNELNAME' and creates
# 'kernel.debug' compiled with -g debugging as well as a normal
# 'kernel'.  Use 'make install.debug' to install the debug kernel
# but that isn't normally necessary as the debug symbols are not loaded
# by the kernel and are not useful there anyway.
#
# KERNEL can be overridden so that you can change the default name of your
# kernel.
#
# MODULES_OVERRIDE can be used to limit modules built to a specific list.

# FreeBSD processes are subject to certain limits to their consumption
# of system resources.  See getrlimit(2) for more details.  Each
# resource limit has two values, a "soft" limit and a "hard" limit.
# The soft limits can be modified during normal system operation, but
# the hard limits are set at boot time.  Their default values are
# in sys/<arch>/include/vmparam.h.  There are two ways to change them:
# 
# 1.  Set the values at kernel build time.  The options below are one
#     way to allow that limit to grow to 1GB.  They can be increased

# Scheduler options:
#
# Specifying one of SCHED_4BSD or SCHED_ULE is mandatory.  These options
# select which scheduler is compiled in.
#
# SCHED_4BSD is the historical, proven, BSD scheduler.  It has a global run
# queue and no CPU affinity which makes it suboptimal for SMP.  It has very
# good interactivity and priority selection.
#
# SCHED_ULE provides significant performance advantages over 4BSD on many
# workloads on SMP machines.  It supports cpu-affinity, per-cpu runqueues
# and scheduler locks.  It also has a stronger notion of interactivity 
# which leads to better responsiveness even on uniprocessor machines.  This
# is the default scheduler.
#
# SCHED_STATS is a debugging option which keeps some stats in the sysctl
# tree at 'kern.sched.stats' and is useful for debugging scheduling decisions.

#
# MALLOC_DEBUG_MAXZONES enables multiple uma zones for malloc(9)
# allocations that are smaller than a page.  The purpose is to isolate
# different malloc types into hash classes, so that any buffer
# overruns or use-after-free will usually only affect memory from
# malloc types in that hash class.  This is purely a debugging tool;
# by varying the hash function and tracking which hash class was

# will point to a single malloc type that is being misused.  At this
# point inspection or memguard(9) can be used to catch the offending
# code.
#
options 	MALLOC_DEBUG_MAXZONES=8

# isn't generally available. And the required eputc() isn't defined.
#
#options	EARLY_PRINTF

#
# KTRACE enables the system-call tracing facility ktrace(2).  To be more
# SMP-friendly, KTRACE uses a worker thread to process most trace events
# asynchronously to the thread generating the event.  This requires a
# pre-allocated store of objects representing trace events.  The
# KTRACE_REQUEST_POOL option specifies the initial size of this store.

# before malloc(9) is functional.
# KTR_COMPILE defines the mask of events to compile into the kernel as
# defined by the KTR_* constants in <sys/ktr.h>.  KTR_MASK defines the
# initial value of the ktr_mask variable which determines at runtime
# what events to trace.  KTR_CPUMASK determines which CPU's log
# events, with bit X corresponding to CPU X.  The layout of the string
# passed as KTR_CPUMASK must match a series of bitmasks each of them
# separated by the "," character (ie:
# KTR_CPUMASK=0xAF,0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF).  KTR_VERBOSE enables
# dumping of KTR events to the console by default.  This functionality
# can be toggled via the debug.ktr_verbose sysctl and defaults to off
# if KTR_VERBOSE is not defined.  See ktr(4) and ktrdump(8) for details.

#
# The INVARIANT_SUPPORT option makes us compile in support for
# verifying some of the internal structures.  It is a prerequisite for

# called.  The intent is that you can set 'INVARIANTS' for single
# source files (by changing the source file or specifying it on the
# command line) if you have 'INVARIANT_SUPPORT' enabled.  Also, if you
# wish to build a kernel module with 'INVARIANTS', then adding
# 'INVARIANT_SUPPORT' to your kernel will provide all the necessary
# infrastructure without the added overhead.
#
options 	INVARIANT_SUPPORT

# The KASSERT_PANIC_OPTIONAL option allows kasserts to fire without
# necessarily inducing a panic.  Panic is the default behavior, but
# runtime options can configure it either entirely off, or off with a
# limit.

# The DIAGNOSTIC option is used to enable extra debugging information
# from some parts of the kernel.  As this makes everything more noisy,
# it is disabled by default.
#
options 	DIAGNOSTIC

#
# REGRESSION causes optional kernel interfaces necessary only for regression
# testing to be enabled.  These interfaces may constitute security risks
# when enabled, as they permit processes to easily modify aspects of the
# run-time environment to reproduce unlikely or unusual (possibly normally
# impossible) scenarios.
#
options 	REGRESSION

#
# This option lets some drivers co-exist that can't co-exist in a running

# STACK enables the stack(9) facility, allowing the capture of kernel stack
# for the purpose of procinfo(1), etc.  stack(9) will also be compiled in
# automatically if DDB(4) is compiled into the kernel.
#
options 	STACK

#
# The NUM_CORE_FILES option specifies the limit for the number of core
# files generated by a particular process, when the core file format
# specifier includes the %I pattern. Since we only have 1 character for
# the core count in the format string, meaning the range will be 0-9, the

# This core file limit can be adjusted at runtime via the debug.ncores
# sysctl.
#
options 	NUM_CORE_FILES=5

#
# The TSLOG option enables timestamped logging of events, especially
# function entries/exits, in order to track the time spent by the kernel.
# In particular, this is useful when investigating the early boot process,
# before it is possible to use more sophisticated tools like DTrace.
# The TSLOGSIZE option controls the size of the (preallocated, fixed

# SCSI DEVICES

# SCSI DEVICE CONFIGURATION

# The SCSI subsystem consists of the `base' SCSI code, a number of
# high-level SCSI device `type' drivers, and the low-level host-adapter
# device drivers.  The host adapters are listed in the ISA and PCI
# device configuration sections below.
#
# It is possible to wire down your SCSI devices so that a given bus,
# target, and LUN always come on line as the same device unit.  In
# earlier versions the unit numbers were assigned in the order that
# the devices were probed on the SCSI bus.  This means that if you
# removed a disk drive, you may have had to rewrite your /etc/fstab
# file, and also that you had to be careful when adding a new disk
# as it may have been probed earlier and moved your device configuration
# around.  (See also option GEOM_VOL for a different solution to this
# problem.)

# This old behavior is maintained as the default behavior.  The unit
# assignment begins with the first non-wired down unit for a device
# type.  For example, if you wire a disk as "da3" then the first
# non-wired disk will be assigned da4.

# The syntax for wiring down devices is:

hint.scbus.0.at="ahc0"
hint.scbus.1.at="ahc1"
hint.scbus.1.bus="0"
hint.scbus.3.at="ahc2"
hint.scbus.3.bus="0"
hint.scbus.2.at="ahc2"
hint.scbus.2.bus="1"
hint.da.0.at="scbus0"
hint.da.0.target="0"
hint.da.0.unit="0"
hint.da.1.at="scbus3"
hint.da.1.target="1"
hint.da.2.at="scbus2"
hint.da.2.target="3"
hint.sa.1.at="scbus1"
hint.sa.1.target="6"

# "units" (SCSI logical unit number) that are not specified are
# treated as if specified as LUN 0.

# All SCSI devices allocate as many units as are required.

# The ch driver drives SCSI Media Changer ("jukebox") devices.
#
# The da driver drives SCSI Direct Access ("disk") and Optical Media
# ("WORM") devices.
#
# The sa driver drives SCSI Sequential Access ("tape") devices.
#
# The cd driver drives SCSI Read Only Direct Access ("cd") devices.
#
# The ses driver drives SCSI Environment Services ("ses") and
# SAF-TE ("SCSI Accessible Fault-Tolerant Enclosure") devices.
#
# The pt driver drives SCSI Processor devices.
#
# The sg driver provides a passthrough API that is compatible with the
# Linux SG driver.  It will work in conjunction with the COMPAT_LINUX
# option to run linux SG apps.  It can also stand on its own and provide
# source level API compatibility for porting apps to FreeBSD.
#
# Target Mode support is provided here but also requires that a SIM
# (SCSI Host Adapter Driver) provide support as well.
#
# The targ driver provides target mode support as a Processor type device.
# It exists to give the minimal context necessary to respond to Inquiry
# commands. There is a sample user application that shows how the rest
# of the command support might be done in /usr/share/examples/scsi_target.
#
# The targbh driver provides target mode support and exists to respond
# to incoming commands that do not otherwise have a logical unit assigned
# to them.
#
# The pass driver provides a passthrough API to access the CAM subsystem.

# Using sysctl(8) run-time overrides on a per-card basis can be made
#
# options 	BROOKTREE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT=BROOKTREE_PAL
# or
# options 	BROOKTREE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT=BROOKTREE_NTSC
# Specifies the default video capture mode.
# This is required for Dual Crystal (28&35MHz) boards where PAL is used
# to prevent hangs during initialization, e.g. VideoLogic Captivator PCI.
#
# options 	BKTR_USE_PLL
# This is required for PAL or SECAM boards with a 28MHz crystal and no 35MHz
# crystal, e.g. some new Bt878 cards.
#
# options 	BKTR_GPIO_ACCESS
# This enables IOCTLs which give user level access to the GPIO port.
#
# options 	BKTR_NO_MSP_RESET
# Prevents the MSP34xx reset. Good if you initialize the MSP in another OS first
#
# options 	BKTR_430_FX_MODE
# Switch Bt878/879 cards into Intel 430FX chipset compatibility mode.
#
# options 	BKTR_SIS_VIA_MODE
# Switch Bt878/879 cards into SIS/VIA chipset compatibility mode which is
# needed for some old SiS and VIA chipset motherboards.
# This also allows Bt878/879 chips to work on old OPTi (<1997) chipset

# As a rough guess, old = before 1998
#
# options 	BKTR_NEW_MSP34XX_DRIVER
# Use new, more complete initialization scheme for the msp34* soundchip.
