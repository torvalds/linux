$FreeBSD$

This directory contains various files derived from CDDL sources that
are used by the ZFS bootstrap:

    fletcher.c			checksum support
    sha256.c			checksum support
    lz4.c			compression support
    lzjb.c			compression support
    blkptr.c			ZFS embedded-data block pointers support
    zfssubr.c			checksum, compression and raidz support
    zfsimpl.h			mostly describing the physical layout

The files fletcher.c, lzjb.c, lz4.c, sha256.c and blkptr.c are largely identical
to the ZFS base code (with write support removed) and could be shared but that
might complicate future imports from Illumos.
