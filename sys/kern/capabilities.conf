## List of system calls enabled in capability mode, one name per line.

## Notes:
## - sys_exit(2), abort2(2) and close(2) are very important.
## - Sorted alphabetically, please keep it that way.

##
## Allow ACL and MAC label operations by file descriptor, subject to
## capability rights.  Allow MAC label operations on the current process but
## we will need to scope __mac_get_pid(2).

##
## Allow sysctl(2) as we scope internal to the call; this is a global
## namespace, but there are several critical sysctls required for almost
## anything to run, such as hw.pagesize.  For now that policy lives in the
## kernel for performance and simplicity, but perhaps it could move to a
## proxying daemon in userspace.
##

## Allow umtx operations as these are scoped by address space.
##
## XXRW: Need to check this very carefully.

## audit(2) is a global operation, submitting to the global trail, but it is
## controlled by privilege, and it might be useful to be able to submit
## records from sandboxes.  For now, disallow, but we may want to think about
## providing some sort of proxy service for this.
