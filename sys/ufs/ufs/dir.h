 * Theoretically, directories can be more than 2Gb in length, however, in

/*
 * A directory consists of some number of blocks of DIRBLKSIZ
 * bytes, where DIRBLKSIZ is chosen such that it can be transferred
 * to disk in a single atomic operation (e.g. 512 bytes on most machines).
 *
 * Each DIRBLKSIZ byte block contains some number of directory entry
 * structures, which are of variable length.  Each directory entry has
 * a struct direct at the front of it, containing its inode number,
 * the length of the entry, and the length of the name contained in
 * the entry.  These are followed by the name padded to a 4 byte boundary
 * with null bytes.  All names are guaranteed null terminated.
 * The maximum length of a name in a directory is MAXNAMLEN.
 *
 * The macro DIRSIZ(dp) gives the amount of space required to represent
 * a directory entry.  Free space in a directory is represented by
 * entries which have dp->d_reclen > DIRSIZ(dp).  All DIRBLKSIZ bytes
 * in a directory block are claimed by the directory entries.  This
 * usually results in the last entry in a directory having a large
 * dp->d_reclen.  When entries are deleted from a directory, the
 * space is returned to the previous entry in the same directory
 * block by increasing its dp->d_reclen.  If the first entry of
 * a directory block is free, then its dp->d_ino is set to 0.
 * Entries other than the first in a directory do not normally have
 * dp->d_ino set to 0.
