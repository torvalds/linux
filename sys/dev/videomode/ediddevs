/*
 * List of known products, grouped and sorted by vendor.

 * EDID version 1.3 requires that monitors expose the monitor name with
 * the ASCII descriptor type 0xFC, so for monitors using that block, this
 * information is redundant, and there is not point in listing them here,
 * unless it is desired to have a symbolic macro to detect the monitor in
 * special handling code or somesuch.
