IEEE 1394 support for FreeBSD-5.X and 4.X.

1. Introduction

	  This tarball contains IEEE1394(FireWire) driver which is first
	written by Katsushi Kobayashi[1] <ikob@koganei.wide.ad.jp> and
	modified by Hidetoshi Shimokawa <simokawa@freebsd.org>.
	Please note this driver is still under development.
	You can find latest snapshots under:
		https://people.freebsd.org/~simokawa/
	named firewire-2002XXXX.tar.gz

	The driver consists of 6 parts:

	- fwohci.c/fwohci_pci.c
		OHCI[2] driver
			- IEEE1394 link/phy chip control
	- firewire.c
		Chip independent driver 
			- CSR
			- Transaction
			- Character devices for userland
	- fwmem.c
		/dev/fwmem0: physical memory of a remote node.
	- sbp.c
		SBP-II[3] (a.k.a. SCSI over FireWire) driver

	- if_fwe.c
		NON-Standard implementation of Ethernet over FireWire.

	- bus_mgm.c (userland)
		Bus management function for user. 
		show topology map, change gap count, bus reset, etc.

2. Installation

	Suppose you have kernel source at /sys.

	- Extract tarball at root directory.
	- cd /sys/dev/firewire
	- make 
	- make install
	- make load

3. SBP-II support (sbp)

	- You need CAM(SCSI) support in your kernel.
	  If you are using FreeBSD-5 before 2002/03/23 or FreeBSD-4 before
	  2002/4/8, you need to apply CAM-patch in this archive
	  to handle HDD's(T_RBC or T_DIRECT which doesn't support READ_6).

	- If you connect a few firewire devices only, try the following to
	  reduce gap overhead.

		- ./bus_mgm -g 8

4. Ethernet over FireWire (if_fwe)

	  This is a sample driver for ethernet emulation. Please note this
	does NOT conform to any standards like IP over FireWire(RFC2734[4]).
	It just sends ethernet frames encapsulated in asynchronous stream
	packets. It doesn't scale because it does something like unicast over		multicast, but it's easy to be implemented and you can use any
	facilities what ethernet can do. (ipv6, bridging, vlan etc.)

	  It also has DEVICE_POLLING[5] support. To enable it, edit your
	kernel config file and Makefile.fwe then rebuild kernel and if_fwe.ko.

5. FireWire for Kernel Hackers

          As you know, IEEE1394 is a bus and OHCI supports physical access
	to the host memory. This means that you can access the remote
	host over firewire without software support at the remote host.
	In other words, you can investigate remote host's physical memory
	whether its OS is alive or crashed or hangs up.

	  You need to apply KVMLIB-patch and rebuild libkvm then rebuild ps,
	dmesg and gdb those are statically linked.
	You may want to apply GDB-patch in this archive to get same behavior
	as gdb with /dev/mem or want to insert savectx(&dumppcb) into panic(),
	breakpoint() and so on to emulation crash dump.

	  You have to determine target node_id manually at this point.
	(guess using bus_mgm -t or dmesg)
	(Targets should be specified by EUI64 in the future)

	# sysctl kern.firewire.fwmem_node=[node_id]

	# ps -agx -M /dev/fwmem0 -N /sys/i386/compile/GENERIC/kernel
	# dmesg -M /dev/fwmem0 -N /sys/i386/compile/GENERIC/kernel
	# gdb -k -c /dev/fwmem0 /sys/i386/compile/GENERIC/kernel.debug
	# dd if=/dev/fwmem0 of=vmcore bs=1m count=[phys. memory in MB]

	remote gdb at 400,000,000 bps :-)

	
6. DV
	I have not tested yet.

7. Tested HW

	OS
	- FreeBSD-4/i386
	- FreeBSD-4/alpha
	- FreeBSD-5/i386

	* Not tested on SMP.
	* Not tested on big-endian machine...

	OHCI
	- Texas Instruments TSB12LV26 (PCI)
	- Texas Instruments TSB43AA22 (PCI/Cardbus)

	* There might be phy probing problem but most of the OHCI
	  chips should work.
	* Tested with multiple firewire buses.

	SBP-II
	- HDD: Logitec USB/FireWire LHD-P30FU
	- HDD: Yano A-dish 120GB
	- HDD: Yano B-Max 320GB
		The repository of cvsup2.jp.freebsd.org is on this device.
	- HDD: Personal Storage 3000XT 160GB
		The last sector of this drive cannot be accessed..
	- DVD-RAM: Panasonic LF-D340JD 
	- SCSI-FireWire converter: Yano FWSCSI-01
		We can recognize only 1 device/lun at this point
	- HDD: iPod, PowerBook G4 (target mode)
		Reported by ikob
	- Scanner: Epson GT-9700F
		Now works!!
		Sane-backend needs a patch(SANE-patch in this archive).

	if_fwe
	- IPv4, IPv6, bridging, vlan.
	- You need at least two FreeBSD machines with this driver to use.
