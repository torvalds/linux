/**
 * DOC: overview
 *
 * This helper library provides implementations of check and commit functions on
 * top of the CRTC modeset helper callbacks and the plane helper callbacks. It
 * also provides convenience implementations for the atomic state handling
 * callbacks for drivers which don't need to subclass the drm core structures to
 * add their own additional internal state.
 *
 * This library also provides default implementations for the check callback in
 * drm_atomic_helper_check() and for the commit callback with
 * drm_atomic_helper_commit(). But the individual stages and callbacks are
 * exposed to allow drivers to mix and match and e.g. use the plane helpers only
 * together with a driver private modeset implementation.
 *
 * This library also provides implementations for all the legacy driver
 * interfaces on top of the atomic interface. See drm_atomic_helper_set_config(),
 * drm_atomic_helper_disable_plane(), and the various functions to implement
 * set_property callbacks. New drivers must not implement these functions
 * themselves but must use the provided helpers.
 *
 * The atomic helper uses the same function table structures as all other
 * modesetting helpers. See the documentation for &struct drm_crtc_helper_funcs,
 * struct &drm_encoder_helper_funcs and &struct drm_connector_helper_funcs. It
 * also shares the &struct drm_plane_helper_funcs function table with the plane
 * helpers.

 * drm_atomic_helper_check_modeset - validate state object for modeset changes
 * @dev: DRM device
 * @state: the driver state object
 *
 * Check the state object to see if the requested state is physically possible.
 * This does all the CRTC and connector related computations for an atomic
 * update and adds any additional connectors needed for full modesets. It calls
 * the various per-object callbacks in the follow order:
 *
 * 1. &drm_connector_helper_funcs.atomic_best_encoder for determining the new encoder.
 * 2. &drm_connector_helper_funcs.atomic_check to validate the connector state.
 * 3. If it's determined a modeset is needed then all connectors on the affected
 *    CRTC are added and &drm_connector_helper_funcs.atomic_check is run on them.
 * 4. &drm_encoder_helper_funcs.mode_valid, &drm_bridge_funcs.mode_valid and
 *    &drm_crtc_helper_funcs.mode_valid are called on the affected components.
 * 5. &drm_bridge_funcs.mode_fixup is called on all encoder bridges.
 * 6. &drm_encoder_helper_funcs.atomic_check is called to validate any encoder state.
 *    This function is only called when the encoder will be part of a configured CRTC,
 *    it must not be used for implementing connector property validation.
 *    If this function is NULL, &drm_atomic_encoder_helper_funcs.mode_fixup is called
 *    instead.
 * 7. &drm_crtc_helper_funcs.mode_fixup is called last, to fix up the mode with CRTC constraints.
 *
 * &drm_crtc_state.mode_changed is set when the input mode is changed.
 * &drm_crtc_state.connectors_changed is set when a connector is added or
 * removed from the CRTC.  &drm_crtc_state.active_changed is set when
 * &drm_crtc_state.active changes, which is used for DPMS.
 * &drm_crtc_state.no_vblank is set from the result of drm_dev_has_vblank().
 * See also: drm_atomic_crtc_needs_modeset()
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 *
 * Drivers which set &drm_crtc_state.mode_changed (e.g. in their
 * &drm_plane_helper_funcs.atomic_check hooks if a plane update can't be done
 * without a full modeset) _must_ call this function after that change. It is
 * permitted to call this function multiple times for the same update, e.g.
 * when the &drm_crtc_helper_funcs.atomic_check functions depend upon the
 * adjusted dotclock for fifo space allocation and watermark computation.
 *
 * RETURNS:
 * Zero for success or -errno

 * 1. Run drm_atomic_helper_prepare_planes(). Since this can fail and we
 * need to propagate out of memory/VRAM errors to userspace, it must be called
 * synchronously.
 *
 * 2. Synchronize with any outstanding nonblocking commit worker threads which
 * might be affected by the new state update. This is handled by
 * drm_atomic_helper_setup_commit().
 *
 * Asynchronous workers need to have sufficient parallelism to be able to run
 * different atomic commits on different CRTCs in parallel. The simplest way to
 * achieve this is by running them on the &system_unbound_wq work queue. Note
 * that drivers are not required to split up atomic commits and run an
 * individual commit in parallel - userspace is supposed to do that if it cares.
 * But it might be beneficial to do that for modesets, since those necessarily
 * must be done as one global operation, and enabling or disabling a CRTC can
 * take a long time. But even that is not required.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: A &drm_atomic_state update for multiple CRTCs is sequenced
 * against all CRTCs therein. Therefore for atomic state updates which only flip
 * planes the driver must not get the struct &drm_crtc_state of unrelated CRTCs
 * in its atomic check code: This would prevent committing of atomic updates to
 * multiple CRTCs in parallel. In general, adding additional state structures
 * should be avoided as much as possible, because this reduces parallelism in
 * (nonblocking) commits, both due to locking and due to commit sequencing
 * requirements.
 *
 * 3. The software state is updated synchronously with
 * drm_atomic_helper_swap_state(). Doing this under the protection of all modeset
 * locks means concurrent callers never see inconsistent state. Note that commit
 * workers do not hold any locks; their access is only coordinated through
 * ordering. If workers would access state only through the pointers in the
 * free-standing state objects (currently not the case for any driver) then even
 * multiple pending commits could be in-flight at the same time.
 *
 * 4. Schedule a work item to do all subsequent steps, using the split-out
 * commit helpers: a) pre-plane commit b) plane commit c) post-plane commit and
 * then cleaning up the framebuffers after the old framebuffer is no longer
 * being displayed. The scheduled work should synchronize against other workers
 * using the &drm_crtc_commit infrastructure as needed. See
 * drm_atomic_helper_setup_commit() for more details.

/**
 * drm_atomic_helper_setup_commit - setup possibly nonblocking commit
 * @state: new modeset state to be committed
 * @nonblock: whether nonblocking behavior is requested.
 *
 * This function prepares @state to be used by the atomic helper's support for
 * nonblocking commits. Drivers using the nonblocking commit infrastructure
 * should always call this function from their
 * &drm_mode_config_funcs.atomic_commit hook.
 *
 * Drivers that need to extend the commit setup to private objects can use the
 * &drm_mode_config_helper_funcs.atomic_commit_setup hook.
 *
 * To be able to use this support drivers need to use a few more helper
 * functions. drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_dependencies() must be called before
 * actually committing the hardware state, and for nonblocking commits this call
 * must be placed in the async worker. See also drm_atomic_helper_swap_state()
 * and its stall parameter, for when a driver's commit hooks look at the
 * &drm_crtc.state, &drm_plane.state or &drm_connector.state pointer directly.
 *
 * Completion of the hardware commit step must be signalled using
 * drm_atomic_helper_commit_hw_done(). After this step the driver is not allowed
 * to read or change any permanent software or hardware modeset state. The only
 * exception is state protected by other means than &drm_modeset_lock locks.
 * Only the free standing @state with pointers to the old state structures can
 * be inspected, e.g. to clean up old buffers using
 * drm_atomic_helper_cleanup_planes().
 *
 * At the very end, before cleaning up @state drivers must call
 * drm_atomic_helper_commit_cleanup_done().
 *
 * This is all implemented by in drm_atomic_helper_commit(), giving drivers a
 * complete and easy-to-use default implementation of the atomic_commit() hook.
 *
 * The tracking of asynchronously executed and still pending commits is done
 * using the core structure &drm_crtc_commit.
 *
 * By default there's no need to clean up resources allocated by this function
 * explicitly: drm_atomic_state_default_clear() will take care of that
 * automatically.
 *
 * Returns:
 * 0 on success. -EBUSY when userspace schedules nonblocking commits too fast,
 * -ENOMEM on allocation failures and -EINTR when a signal is pending.

 * functions for planes and CRTCs. It assumes that the atomic state has already

 * If the hardware can't support this approach look at
 * drm_atomic_helper_commit_planes_on_crtc() instead.
 *
 * Plane parameters can be updated by applications while the associated CRTC is
 * disabled. The DRM/KMS core will store the parameters in the plane state,
 * which will be available to the driver when the CRTC is turned on. As a result
 * most drivers don't need to be immediately notified of plane updates for a
 * disabled CRTC.
 *
 * Unless otherwise needed, drivers are advised to set the ACTIVE_ONLY flag in
 * @flags in order not to receive plane update notifications related to a
 * disabled CRTC. This avoids the need to manually ignore plane updates in
 * driver code when the driver and/or hardware can't or just don't need to deal
 * with updates on disabled CRTCs, for example when supporting runtime PM.
 *
 * Drivers may set the NO_DISABLE_AFTER_MODESET flag in @flags if the relevant
 * display controllers require to disable a CRTC's planes when the CRTC is
 * disabled. This function would skip the &drm_plane_helper_funcs.atomic_disable
 * call for a plane if the CRTC of the old plane state needs a modesetting
 * operation. Of course, the drivers need to disable the planes in their CRTC
 * disable callbacks since no one else would do that.
 *

 * ACTIVE_ONLY flag to most closely match the behaviour of the legacy helpers.
