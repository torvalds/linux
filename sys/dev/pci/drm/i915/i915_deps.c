/**
 * DOC: Set of utilities to dynamically collect dependencies into a
 * structure which is fed into the GT migration code.
 *
 * Once we can do async unbinding, this is also needed to coalesce
 * the migration fence with the unbind fences if these are coalesced
 * post-migration.
 *
 * While collecting the individual dependencies, we store the refcounted
 * struct dma_fence pointers in a realloc-managed pointer array, since
 * that can be easily fed into a dma_fence_array. Other options are
 * available, like for example an xarray for similarity with drm/sched.
 * Can be changed easily if needed.
 *
 * A struct i915_deps need to be initialized using i915_deps_init().
 * If i915_deps_add_dependency() or i915_deps_add_resv() return an
 * error code they will internally call i915_deps_fini(), which frees
 * all internal references and allocations.
