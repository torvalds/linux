/**
 * DOC: Global GTT views
 *
 * Background and previous state
 *
 * Historically objects could exists (be bound) in global GTT space only as
 * singular instances with a view representing all of the object's backing pages
 * in a linear fashion. This view will be called a normal view.
 *
 * To support multiple views of the same object, where the number of mapped
 * pages is not equal to the backing store, or where the layout of the pages
 * is not linear, concept of a GGTT view was added.
 *
 * One example of an alternative view is a stereo display driven by a single
 * image. In this case we would have a framebuffer looking like this
 * (2x2 pages):
 *
 *    12
 *    34
 *
 * Above would represent a normal GGTT view as normally mapped for GPU or CPU
 * rendering. In contrast, fed to the display engine would be an alternative
 * view which could look something like this:
 *
 *   1212
 *   3434
 *
 * In this example both the size and layout of pages in the alternative view is
 * different from the normal view.
 *
 * Implementation and usage
 *
 * GGTT views are implemented using VMAs and are distinguished via enum
 * i915_gtt_view_type and struct i915_gtt_view.
 *
 * A new flavour of core GEM functions which work with GGTT bound objects were
 * added with the _ggtt_ infix, and sometimes with _view postfix to avoid
 * renaming  in large amounts of code. They take the struct i915_gtt_view
 * parameter encapsulating all metadata required to implement a view.
 *
 * As a helper for callers which are only interested in the normal view,
 * globally const i915_gtt_view_normal singleton instance exists. All old core
 * GEM API functions, the ones not taking the view parameter, are operating on,
 * or with the normal GGTT view.
 *
 * Code wanting to add or use a new GGTT view needs to:
 *
 * 1. Add a new enum with a suitable name.
 * 2. Extend the metadata in the i915_gtt_view structure if required.
 * 3. Add support to i915_get_vma_pages().
 *
 * New views are required to build a scatter-gather table from within the
 * i915_get_vma_pages function. This table is stored in the vma.gtt_view and
 * exists for the lifetime of an VMA.
 *
 * Core API is designed to have copy semantics which means that passed in
 * struct i915_gtt_view does not need to be persistent (left around after
 * calling the core API functions).
 *
