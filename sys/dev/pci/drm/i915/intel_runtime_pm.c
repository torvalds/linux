/**
 * DOC: runtime pm
 *
 * The i915 driver supports dynamic enabling and disabling of entire hardware
 * blocks at runtime. This is especially important on the display side where
 * software is supposed to control many power gates manually on recent hardware,
 * since on the GT side a lot of the power management is done by the hardware.
 * But even there some manual control at the device level is required.
 *
 * Since i915 supports a diverse set of platforms with a unified codebase and
 * hardware engineers just love to shuffle functionality around between power
 * domains there's a sizeable amount of indirection required. This file provides
 * generic functions to the driver for grabbing and releasing references for
 * abstract power domains. It then maps those to the actual power wells
 * present for a given platform.
