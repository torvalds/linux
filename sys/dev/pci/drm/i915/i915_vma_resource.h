 * struct i915_vma_resource - Snapshotted unbind information.
 * @unbind_fence: Fence to mark unbinding complete. Note that this fence
 * is not considered published until unbind is scheduled, and as such it
 * is illegal to access this fence before scheduled unbind other than
 * for refcounting.
 * @lock: The @unbind_fence lock.
 * @hold_count: Number of holders blocking the fence from finishing.
 * The vma itself is keeping a hold, which is released when unbind
 * is scheduled.
 * @work: Work struct for deferred unbind work.
 * @chain: Pointer to struct i915_sw_fence used to await dependencies.
 * @rb: Rb node for the vm's pending unbind interval tree.
 * @__subtree_last: Interval tree private member.
 * @wakeref: wakeref.
 * @vm: non-refcounted pointer to the vm. This is for internal use only and
 * this member is cleared after vm_resource unbind.
 * @mr: The memory region of the object pointed to by the vma.
 * @ops: Pointer to the backend i915_vma_ops.
 * @private: Bind backend private info.
 * @start: Offset into the address space of bind range start. Note that
 * this is after any padding that might have been allocated.
 * @node_size: Size of the allocated range manager node with padding
 * subtracted.
 * @vma_size: Bind size.
 * @guard: The size of guard area preceding and trailing the bind.
 * @page_sizes_gtt: Resulting page sizes from the bind operation.
 * @bound_flags: Flags indicating binding status.
 * @allocated: Backend private data. TODO: Should move into @private.
 * @immediate_unbind: Unbind can be done immediately and doesn't need to be
 * deferred to a work item awaiting unsignaled fences. This is a hack.
 * (dma_fence_work uses a fence flag for this, but this seems slightly
 * cleaner).
 * @needs_wakeref: Whether a wakeref is needed during unbind. Since we can't
 * take a wakeref in the dma-fence signalling critical path, it needs to be
 * taken when the unbind is scheduled.
 * @skip_pte_rewrite: During ggtt suspend and vm takedown pte rewriting
 * needs to be skipped for unbind.
 * @tlb: pointer for obj->mm.tlb, if async unbind. Otherwise, NULL
 *
 * The lifetime of a struct i915_vma_resource is from a binding request to
 * the actual possible asynchronous unbind has completed.
