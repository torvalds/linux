/*
 * Rather than have every client wait upon all user interrupts,
 * with the herd waking after every interrupt and each doing the
 * heavyweight seqno dance, we delegate the task (of being the
 * bottom-half of the user interrupt) to the first client. After
 * every interrupt, we wake up one client, who does the heavyweight
 * coherent seqno read and either goes back to sleep (if incomplete),
 * or wakes up all the completed clients in parallel, before then
 * transferring the bottom-half status to the next client in the queue.
 *
 * Compared to walking the entire list of waiters in a single dedicated
 * bottom-half, we reduce the latency of the first waiter by avoiding
 * a context switch, but incur additional coherent seqno reads when
 * following the chain of request breadcrumbs. Since it is most likely
 * that we have a single client waiting on each seqno, then reducing
 * the overhead of waking that client is much preferred.
