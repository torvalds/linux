	 * flags: Control various stages of the GPU reset
	 *
	 * #I915_RESET_BACKOFF - When we start a global reset, we need to
	 * serialise with any other users attempting to do the same, and
	 * any global resources that may be clobber by the reset (such as
	 * FENCE registers).
	 *
	 * #I915_RESET_ENGINE[num_engines] - Since the driver doesn't need to
	 * acquire the struct_mutex to reset an engine, we need an explicit
	 * flag to prevent two concurrent reset attempts in the same engine.
	 * As the number of engines continues to grow, allocate the flags from
	 * the most significant bits.
	 *
	 * #I915_WEDGED - If reset fails and we can no longer use the GPU,
	 * we set the #I915_WEDGED bit. Prior to command submission, e.g.
	 * i915_request_alloc(), this bit is checked and the sequence
	 * aborted (with -EIO reported to userspace) if set.
	 *
	 * #I915_WEDGED_ON_INIT - If we fail to initialize the GPU we can no
	 * longer use the GPU - similar to #I915_WEDGED bit. The difference in
	 * the way we're handling "forced" unwedged (e.g. through debugfs),
	 * which is not allowed in case we failed to initialize.
	 *
	 * #I915_WEDGED_ON_FINI - Similar to #I915_WEDGED_ON_INIT, except we
	 * use it to mark that the GPU is no longer available (and prevent
	 * users from using it).
