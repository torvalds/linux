/*
 * We treat requests as fences. This is not be to confused with our
 * "fence registers" but pipeline synchronisation objects ala GL_ARB_sync.
 * We use the fences to synchronize access from the CPU with activity on the
 * GPU, for example, we should not rewrite an object's PTE whilst the GPU
 * is reading them. We also track fences at a higher level to provide
 * implicit synchronisation around GEM objects, e.g. set-domain will wait
 * for outstanding GPU rendering before marking the object ready for CPU
 * access, or a pageflip will wait until the GPU is complete before showing
 * the frame on the scanout.
 *
 * In order to use a fence, the object must track the fence it needs to
 * serialise with. For example, GEM objects want to track both read and
 * write access so that we can perform concurrent read operations between
 * the CPU and GPU engines, as well as waiting for all rendering to
 * complete, or waiting for the last GPU user of a "fence register". The
 * object then embeds a #i915_active_fence to track the most recent (in
 * retirement order) request relevant for the desired mode of access.
 * The #i915_active_fence is updated with i915_active_fence_set() to
 * track the most recent fence request, typically this is done as part of
 * i915_vma_move_to_active().
 *
 * When the #i915_active_fence completes (is retired), it will
 * signal its completion to the owner through a callback as well as mark
 * itself as idle (i915_active_fence.request == NULL). The owner
 * can then perform any action, such as delayed freeing of an active
 * resource including itself.

/*
 * GPU activity tracking
 *
 * Each set of commands submitted to the GPU compromises a single request that
 * signals a fence upon completion. struct i915_request combines the
 * command submission, scheduling and fence signaling roles. If we want to see
 * if a particular task is complete, we need to grab the fence (struct
 * i915_request) for that task and check or wait for it to be signaled. More
 * often though we want to track the status of a bunch of tasks, for example
 * to wait for the GPU to finish accessing some memory across a variety of
 * different command pipelines from different clients. We could choose to
 * track every single request associated with the task, but knowing that
 * each request belongs to an ordered timeline (later requests within a
 * timeline must wait for earlier requests), we need only track the
 * latest request in each timeline to determine the overall status of the
 * task.
 *
 * struct i915_active provides this tracking across timelines. It builds a
 * composite shared-fence, and is updated as new work is submitted to the task,
 * forming a snapshot of the current status. It should be embedded into the
 * different resources that need to track their associated GPU activity to
 * provide a callback when that GPU activity has ceased, or otherwise to
 * provide a serialisation point either for request submission or for CPU
 * synchronisation.
