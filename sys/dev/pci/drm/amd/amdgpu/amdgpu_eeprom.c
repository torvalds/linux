/* EEPROM memory addresses are 19-bits long, which can
 * be partitioned into 3, 8, 8 bits, for a total of 19.
 * The upper 3 bits are sent as part of the 7-bit
 * "Device Type Identifier"--an I2C concept, which for EEPROM devices
 * is hard-coded as 1010b, indicating that it is an EEPROM
 * device--this is the wire format, followed by the upper
 * 3 bits of the 19-bit address, followed by the direction,
 * followed by two bytes holding the rest of the 16-bits of
 * the EEPROM memory address. The format on the wire for EEPROM
 * devices is: 1010XYZD, A15:A8, A7:A0,
 * Where D is the direction and sequenced out by the hardware.
 * Bits XYZ are memory address bits 18, 17 and 16.
 * These bits are compared to how pins 1-3 of the part are connected,
 * depending on the size of the part, more on that later.
 *
 * Note that of this wire format, a client is in control
 * of, and needs to specify only XYZ, A15:A8, A7:0, bits,
 * which is exactly the EEPROM memory address, or offset,
 * in order to address up to 8 EEPROM devices on the I2C bus.
 *
 * For instance, a 2-Mbit I2C EEPROM part, addresses all its bytes,
 * using an 18-bit address, bit 17 to 0 and thus would use all but one bit of
 * the 19 bits previously mentioned. The designer would then not connect
 * pins 1 and 2, and pin 3 usually named "A_2" or "E2", would be connected to
 * either Vcc or GND. This would allow for up to two 2-Mbit parts on
 * the same bus, where one would be addressable with bit 18 as 1, and
 * the other with bit 18 of the address as 0.
 *
 * For a 2-Mbit part, bit 18 is usually known as the "Chip Enable" or
 * "Hardware Address Bit". This bit is compared to the load on pin 3
 * of the device, described above, and if there is a match, then this
 * device responds to the command. This way, you can connect two
 * 2-Mbit EEPROM devices on the same bus, but see one contiguous
 * memory from 0 to 7FFFFh, where address 0 to 3FFFF is in the device
 * whose pin 3 is connected to GND, and address 40000 to 7FFFFh is in
 * the 2nd device, whose pin 3 is connected to Vcc.
 *
 * This addressing you encode in the 32-bit "eeprom_addr" below,
 * namely the 19-bits "XYZ,A15:A0", as a single 19-bit address. For
 * instance, eeprom_addr = 0x6DA01, is 110_1101_1010_0000_0001, where
 * XYZ=110b, and A15:A0=DA01h. The XYZ bits become part of the device
 * address, and the rest of the address bits are sent as the memory
 * address bytes.
 *
 * That is, for an I2C EEPROM driver everything is controlled by
 * the "eeprom_addr".
 *
 * See also top of amdgpu_ras_eeprom.c.
 *
 * P.S. If you need to write, lock and read the Identification Page,
 * (M24M02-DR device only, which we do not use), change the "7" to
 * "0xF" in the macro below, and let the client set bit 20 to 1 in
 * "eeprom_addr", and set A10 to 0 to write into it, and A10 and A1 to
 * 1 to lock it permanently.
