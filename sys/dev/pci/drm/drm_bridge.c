/**
 * DOC: overview
 *
 * &struct drm_bridge represents a device that hangs on to an encoder. These are
 * handy when a regular &drm_encoder entity isn't enough to represent the entire
 * encoder chain.
 *
 * A bridge is always attached to a single &drm_encoder at a time, but can be
 * either connected to it directly, or through a chain of bridges::
 *
 *     [ CRTC ---> ] Encoder ---> Bridge A ---> Bridge B
 *
 * Here, the output of the encoder feeds to bridge A, and that furthers feeds to
 * bridge B. Bridge chains can be arbitrarily long, and shall be fully linear:
 * Chaining multiple bridges to the output of a bridge, or the same bridge to
 * the output of different bridges, is not supported.
 *
 * &drm_bridge, like &drm_panel, aren't &drm_mode_object entities like planes,
 * CRTCs, encoders or connectors and hence are not visible to userspace. They
 * just provide additional hooks to get the desired output at the end of the
 * encoder chain.
 */

/**
 * DOC:	display driver integration
 *
 * Display drivers are responsible for linking encoders with the first bridge
 * in the chains. This is done by acquiring the appropriate bridge with
 * devm_drm_of_get_bridge(). Once acquired, the bridge shall be attached to the
 * encoder with a call to drm_bridge_attach().
 *
 * Bridges are responsible for linking themselves with the next bridge in the
 * chain, if any. This is done the same way as for encoders, with the call to
 * drm_bridge_attach() occurring in the &drm_bridge_funcs.attach operation.
 *
 * Once these links are created, the bridges can participate along with encoder
 * functions to perform mode validation and fixup (through
 * drm_bridge_chain_mode_valid() and drm_atomic_bridge_chain_check()), mode
 * setting (through drm_bridge_chain_mode_set()), enable (through
 * drm_atomic_bridge_chain_pre_enable() and drm_atomic_bridge_chain_enable())
 * and disable (through drm_atomic_bridge_chain_disable() and
 * drm_atomic_bridge_chain_post_disable()). Those functions call the
 * corresponding operations provided in &drm_bridge_funcs in sequence for all
 * bridges in the chain.
 *
 * For display drivers that use the atomic helpers
 * drm_atomic_helper_check_modeset(),
 * drm_atomic_helper_commit_modeset_enables() and
 * drm_atomic_helper_commit_modeset_disables() (either directly in hand-rolled
 * commit check and commit tail handlers, or through the higher-level
 * drm_atomic_helper_check() and drm_atomic_helper_commit_tail() or
 * drm_atomic_helper_commit_tail_rpm() helpers), this is done transparently and
 * requires no intervention from the driver. For other drivers, the relevant
 * DRM bridge chain functions shall be called manually.
 *
 * Bridges also participate in implementing the &drm_connector at the end of
 * the bridge chain. Display drivers may use the drm_bridge_connector_init()
 * helper to create the &drm_connector, or implement it manually on top of the
 * connector-related operations exposed by the bridge (see the overview
 * documentation of bridge operations for more details).
 */

/**
 * DOC: special care dsi
 *
 * The interaction between the bridges and other frameworks involved in
 * the probing of the upstream driver and the bridge driver can be
 * challenging. Indeed, there's multiple cases that needs to be
 * considered:
 *
 * - The upstream driver doesn't use the component framework and isn't a
 *   MIPI-DSI host. In this case, the bridge driver will probe at some
 *   point and the upstream driver should try to probe again by returning
 *   EPROBE_DEFER as long as the bridge driver hasn't probed.
 *
 * - The upstream driver doesn't use the component framework, but is a
 *   MIPI-DSI host. The bridge device uses the MIPI-DCS commands to be
 *   controlled. In this case, the bridge device is a child of the
 *   display device and when it will probe it's assured that the display
 *   device (and MIPI-DSI host) is present. The upstream driver will be
 *   assured that the bridge driver is connected between the
 *   &mipi_dsi_host_ops.attach and &mipi_dsi_host_ops.detach operations.
 *   Therefore, it must run mipi_dsi_host_register() in its probe
 *   function, and then run drm_bridge_attach() in its
 *   &mipi_dsi_host_ops.attach hook.
 *
 * - The upstream driver uses the component framework and is a MIPI-DSI
 *   host. The bridge device uses the MIPI-DCS commands to be
 *   controlled. This is the same situation than above, and can run
 *   mipi_dsi_host_register() in either its probe or bind hooks.
 *
 * - The upstream driver uses the component framework and is a MIPI-DSI
 *   host. The bridge device uses a separate bus (such as I2C) to be
 *   controlled. In this case, there's no correlation between the probe
 *   of the bridge and upstream drivers, so care must be taken to avoid
 *   an endless EPROBE_DEFER loop, with each driver waiting for the
 *   other to probe.
 *
 * The ideal pattern to cover the last item (and all the others in the
 * MIPI-DSI host driver case) is to split the operations like this:
 *
 * - The MIPI-DSI host driver must run mipi_dsi_host_register() in its
 *   probe hook. It will make sure that the MIPI-DSI host sticks around,
 *   and that the driver's bind can be called.
 *
 * - In its probe hook, the bridge driver must try to find its MIPI-DSI
 *   host, register as a MIPI-DSI device and attach the MIPI-DSI device
 *   to its host. The bridge driver is now functional.
 *
 * - In its &struct mipi_dsi_host_ops.attach hook, the MIPI-DSI host can
 *   now add its component. Its bind hook will now be called and since
 *   the bridge driver is attached and registered, we can now look for
 *   and attach it.
 *
 * At this point, we're now certain that both the upstream driver and
 * the bridge driver are functional and we can't have a deadlock-like
 * situation when probing.
 */

/**
 * DOC: dsi bridge operations
 *
 * DSI host interfaces are expected to be implemented as bridges rather than
 * encoders, however there are a few aspects of their operation that need to
 * be defined in order to provide a consistent interface.
 *
 * A DSI host should keep the PHY powered down until the pre_enable operation is
 * called. All lanes are in an undefined idle state up to this point, and it
 * must not be assumed that it is LP-11.
 * pre_enable should initialise the PHY, set the data lanes to LP-11, and the
 * clock lane to either LP-11 or HS depending on the mode_flag
 * %MIPI_DSI_CLOCK_NON_CONTINUOUS.
 *
 * Ordinarily the downstream bridge DSI peripheral pre_enable will have been
 * called before the DSI host. If the DSI peripheral requires LP-11 and/or
 * the clock lane to be in HS mode prior to pre_enable, then it can set the
 * &pre_enable_prev_first flag to request the pre_enable (and
 * post_disable) order to be altered to enable the DSI host first.
 *
 * Either the CRTC being enabled, or the DSI host enable operation should switch
 * the host to actively transmitting video on the data lanes.
 *
 * The reverse also applies. The DSI host disable operation or stopping the CRTC
 * should stop transmitting video, and the data lanes should return to the LP-11
 * state. The DSI host &post_disable operation should disable the PHY.
 * If the &pre_enable_prev_first flag is set, then the DSI peripheral's
 * bridge &post_disable will be called before the DSI host's post_disable.
 *
 * Whilst it is valid to call &host_transfer prior to pre_enable or after
 * post_disable, the exact state of the lanes is undefined at this point. The
 * DSI host should initialise the interface, transmit the data, and then disable
 * the interface again.
 *
 * Ultra Low Power State (ULPS) is not explicitly supported by DRM. If
 * implemented, it therefore needs to be handled entirely within the DSI Host
 * driver.

/**
 * DOC: bridge operations
 *
 * Bridge drivers expose operations through the &drm_bridge_funcs structure.
 * The DRM internals (atomic and CRTC helpers) use the helpers defined in
 * drm_bridge.c to call bridge operations. Those operations are divided in
 * three big categories to support different parts of the bridge usage.
 *
 * - The encoder-related operations support control of the bridges in the
 *   chain, and are roughly counterparts to the &drm_encoder_helper_funcs
 *   operations. They are used by the legacy CRTC and the atomic modeset
 *   helpers to perform mode validation, fixup and setting, and enable and
 *   disable the bridge automatically.
 *
 *   The enable and disable operations are split in
 *   &drm_bridge_funcs.pre_enable, &drm_bridge_funcs.enable,
 *   &drm_bridge_funcs.disable and &drm_bridge_funcs.post_disable to provide
 *   finer-grained control.
 *
 *   Bridge drivers may implement the legacy version of those operations, or
 *   the atomic version (prefixed with atomic\_), in which case they shall also
 *   implement the atomic state bookkeeping operations
 *   (&drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_duplicate_state,
 *   &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_destroy_state and &drm_bridge_funcs.reset).
 *   Mixing atomic and non-atomic versions of the operations is not supported.
 *
 * - The bus format negotiation operations
 *   &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_output_bus_fmts and
 *   &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_input_bus_fmts allow bridge drivers to
 *   negotiate the formats transmitted between bridges in the chain when
 *   multiple formats are supported. Negotiation for formats is performed
 *   transparently for display drivers by the atomic modeset helpers. Only
 *   atomic versions of those operations exist, bridge drivers that need to
 *   implement them shall thus also implement the atomic version of the
 *   encoder-related operations. This feature is not supported by the legacy
 *   CRTC helpers.
 *
 * - The connector-related operations support implementing a &drm_connector
 *   based on a chain of bridges. DRM bridges traditionally create a
 *   &drm_connector for bridges meant to be used at the end of the chain. This
 *   puts additional burden on bridge drivers, especially for bridges that may
 *   be used in the middle of a chain or at the end of it. Furthermore, it
 *   requires all operations of the &drm_connector to be handled by a single
 *   bridge, which doesn't always match the hardware architecture.
 *
 *   To simplify bridge drivers and make the connector implementation more
 *   flexible, a new model allows bridges to unconditionally skip creation of
 *   &drm_connector and instead expose &drm_bridge_funcs operations to support
 *   an externally-implemented &drm_connector. Those operations are
 *   &drm_bridge_funcs.detect, &drm_bridge_funcs.get_modes,
 *   &drm_bridge_funcs.get_edid, &drm_bridge_funcs.hpd_notify,
 *   &drm_bridge_funcs.hpd_enable and &drm_bridge_funcs.hpd_disable. When
 *   implemented, display drivers shall create a &drm_connector instance for
 *   each chain of bridges, and implement those connector instances based on
 *   the bridge connector operations.
 *
 *   Bridge drivers shall implement the connector-related operations for all
 *   the features that the bridge hardware support. For instance, if a bridge
 *   supports reading EDID, the &drm_bridge_funcs.get_edid shall be
 *   implemented. This however doesn't mean that the DDC lines are wired to the
 *   bridge on a particular platform, as they could also be connected to an I2C
 *   controller of the SoC. Support for the connector-related operations on the
 *   running platform is reported through the &drm_bridge.ops flags. Bridge
 *   drivers shall detect which operations they can support on the platform
 *   (usually this information is provided by ACPI or DT), and set the
 *   &drm_bridge.ops flags for all supported operations. A flag shall only be
 *   set if the corresponding &drm_bridge_funcs operation is implemented, but
 *   an implemented operation doesn't necessarily imply that the corresponding
 *   flag will be set. Display drivers shall use the &drm_bridge.ops flags to
 *   decide which bridge to delegate a connector operation to. This mechanism
 *   allows providing a single static const &drm_bridge_funcs instance in
 *   bridge drivers, improving security by storing function pointers in
 *   read-only memory.
 *
 *   In order to ease transition, bridge drivers may support both the old and
 *   new models by making connector creation optional and implementing the
 *   connected-related bridge operations. Connector creation is then controlled
 *   by the flags argument to the drm_bridge_attach() function. Display drivers
 *   that support the new model and create connectors themselves shall set the
 *   %DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR flag, and bridge drivers shall then skip
 *   connector creation. For intermediate bridges in the chain, the flag shall
 *   be passed to the drm_bridge_attach() call for the downstream bridge.
 *   Bridge drivers that implement the new model only shall return an error
 *   from their &drm_bridge_funcs.attach handler when the
 *   %DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR flag is not set. New display drivers
 *   should use the new model, and convert the bridge drivers they use if
 *   needed, in order to gradually transition to the new model.

/*
 * This function is called by &drm_atomic_bridge_chain_check() just before
 * calling &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_check() on all elements of the chain.
 * It performs bus format negotiation between bridge elements. The negotiation
 * happens in reverse order, starting from the last element in the chain up to
 * @bridge.
 *
 * Negotiation starts by retrieving supported output bus formats on the last
 * bridge element and testing them one by one. The test is recursive, meaning
 * that for each tested output format, the whole chain will be walked backward,
 * and each element will have to choose an input bus format that can be
 * transcoded to the requested output format. When a bridge element does not
 * support transcoding into a specific output format -ENOTSUPP is returned and
 * the next bridge element will have to try a different format. If none of the
 * combinations worked, -ENOTSUPP is returned and the atomic modeset will fail.
 *
 * This implementation is relying on
 * &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_output_bus_fmts() and
 * &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_input_bus_fmts() to gather supported
 * input/output formats.
 *
 * When &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_output_bus_fmts() is not implemented by
 * the last element of the chain, &drm_atomic_bridge_chain_select_bus_fmts()
 * tries a single format: &drm_connector.display_info.bus_formats[0] if
 * available, MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED otherwise.
 *
 * When &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_input_bus_fmts() is not implemented,
 * &drm_atomic_bridge_chain_select_bus_fmts() skips the negotiation on the
 * bridge element that lacks this hook and asks the previous element in the
 * chain to try MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED. It's up to bridge drivers to decide what
 * to do in that case (fail if they want to enforce bus format negotiation, or
 * provide a reasonable default if they need to support pipelines where not
 * all elements support bus format negotiation).
