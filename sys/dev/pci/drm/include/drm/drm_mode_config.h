	 * @fb_create:
	 *
	 * Create a new framebuffer object. The core does basic checks on the
	 * requested metadata, but most of that is left to the driver. See
	 * &struct drm_mode_fb_cmd2 for details.
	 *
	 * To validate the pixel format and modifier drivers can use
	 * drm_any_plane_has_format() to make sure at least one plane supports
	 * the requested values. Note that the driver must first determine the
	 * actual modifier used if the request doesn't have it specified,
	 * ie. when (@mode_cmd->flags & DRM_MODE_FB_MODIFIERS) == 0.
	 *
	 * IMPORTANT: These implied modifiers for legacy userspace must be
	 * stored in struct &drm_framebuffer, including all relevant metadata
	 * like &drm_framebuffer.pitches and &drm_framebuffer.offsets if the
	 * modifier enables additional planes beyond the fourcc pixel format
	 * code. This is required by the GETFB2 ioctl.
	 *
	 * If the parameters are deemed valid and the backing storage objects in
	 * the underlying memory manager all exist, then the driver allocates
	 * a new &drm_framebuffer structure, subclassed to contain
	 * driver-specific information (like the internal native buffer object
	 * references). It also needs to fill out all relevant metadata, which
	 * should be done by calling drm_helper_mode_fill_fb_struct().
	 *
	 * The initialization is finalized by calling drm_framebuffer_init(),
	 * which registers the framebuffer and makes it accessible to other
	 * threads.

	 *
	 * A new framebuffer with an initial reference count of 1 or a negative

	 * This is the only hook to validate an atomic modeset update. This
	 * function must reject any modeset and state changes which the hardware
	 * or driver doesn't support. This includes but is of course not limited
	 * to:
	 *
	 *  - Checking that the modes, framebuffers, scaling and placement
	 *    requirements and so on are within the limits of the hardware.
	 *
	 *  - Checking that any hidden shared resources are not oversubscribed.
	 *    This can be shared PLLs, shared lanes, overall memory bandwidth,
	 *    display fifo space (where shared between planes or maybe even
	 *    CRTCs).
	 *
	 *  - Checking that virtualized resources exported to userspace are not
	 *    oversubscribed. For various reasons it can make sense to expose
	 *    more planes, crtcs or encoders than which are physically there. One
	 *    example is dual-pipe operations (which generally should be hidden
	 *    from userspace if when lockstepped in hardware, exposed otherwise),
	 *    where a plane might need 1 hardware plane (if it's just on one
	 *    pipe), 2 hardware planes (when it spans both pipes) or maybe even
	 *    shared a hardware plane with a 2nd plane (if there's a compatible
	 *    plane requested on the area handled by the other pipe).
	 *
	 *  - Check that any transitional state is possible and that if
	 *    requested, the update can indeed be done in the vblank period
	 *    without temporarily disabling some functions.
	 *
	 *  - Check any other constraints the driver or hardware might have.
	 *
	 *  - This callback also needs to correctly fill out the &drm_crtc_state
	 *    in this update to make sure that drm_atomic_crtc_needs_modeset()
	 *    reflects the nature of the possible update and returns true if and
	 *    only if the update cannot be applied without tearing within one
	 *    vblank on that CRTC. The core uses that information to reject
	 *    updates which require a full modeset (i.e. blanking the screen, or
	 *    at least pausing updates for a substantial amount of time) if
	 *    userspace has disallowed that in its request.
	 *
	 *  - The driver also does not need to repeat basic input validation
	 *    like done for the corresponding legacy entry points. The core does
	 *    that before calling this hook.
	 *
	 * See the documentation of @atomic_commit for an exhaustive list of
	 * error conditions which don't have to be checked at the in this
	 * callback.
	 *
	 * See the documentation for &struct drm_atomic_state for how exactly
	 * an atomic modeset update is described.
	 *
	 * Drivers using the atomic helpers can implement this hook using
	 * drm_atomic_helper_check(), or one of the exported sub-functions of
	 * it.
	 *
	 * RETURNS:
	 *
	 * 0 on success or one of the below negative error codes:
	 *
	 *  - -EINVAL, if any of the above constraints are violated.
	 *
	 *  - -EDEADLK, when returned from an attempt to acquire an additional
	 *    &drm_modeset_lock through drm_modeset_lock().
	 *
	 *  - -ENOMEM, if allocating additional state sub-structures failed due
	 *    to lack of memory.
	 *
	 *  - -EINTR, -EAGAIN or -ERESTARTSYS, if the IOCTL should be restarted.
	 *    This can either be due to a pending signal, or because the driver
	 *    needs to completely bail out to recover from an exceptional
	 *    situation like a GPU hang. From a userspace point all errors are
	 *    treated equally.

	 *
	 * This is the only hook to commit an atomic modeset update. The core
	 * guarantees that @atomic_check has been called successfully before
	 * calling this function, and that nothing has been changed in the
	 * interim.
	 *
	 * See the documentation for &struct drm_atomic_state for how exactly
	 * an atomic modeset update is described.
	 *
	 * Drivers using the atomic helpers can implement this hook using
	 * drm_atomic_helper_commit(), or one of the exported sub-functions of
	 * it.
	 *
	 * Nonblocking commits (as indicated with the nonblock parameter) must
	 * do any preparatory work which might result in an unsuccessful commit
	 * in the context of this callback. The only exceptions are hardware
	 * errors resulting in -EIO. But even in that case the driver must
	 * ensure that the display pipe is at least running, to avoid
	 * compositors crashing when pageflips don't work. Anything else,
	 * specifically committing the update to the hardware, should be done
	 * without blocking the caller. For updates which do not require a
	 * modeset this must be guaranteed.
	 *
	 * The driver must wait for any pending rendering to the new
	 * framebuffers to complete before executing the flip. It should also
	 * wait for any pending rendering from other drivers if the underlying
	 * buffer is a shared dma-buf. Nonblocking commits must not wait for
	 * rendering in the context of this callback.
	 *
	 * An application can request to be notified when the atomic commit has
	 * completed. These events are per-CRTC and can be distinguished by the
	 * CRTC index supplied in &drm_event to userspace.
	 *
	 * The drm core will supply a &struct drm_event in each CRTC's
	 * &drm_crtc_state.event. See the documentation for
	 * &drm_crtc_state.event for more details about the precise semantics of
	 * this event.
	 *
	 * NOTE:
	 *
	 * Drivers are not allowed to shut down any display pipe successfully
	 * enabled through an atomic commit on their own. Doing so can result in
	 * compositors crashing if a page flip is suddenly rejected because the
	 * pipe is off.
	 *
	 * RETURNS:
	 *
	 * 0 on success or one of the below negative error codes:
	 *
	 *  - -EBUSY, if a nonblocking updated is requested and there is
	 *    an earlier updated pending. Drivers are allowed to support a queue
	 *    of outstanding updates, but currently no driver supports that.
	 *    Note that drivers must wait for preceding updates to complete if a
	 *    synchronous update is requested, they are not allowed to fail the
	 *    commit in that case.
	 *
	 *  - -ENOMEM, if the driver failed to allocate memory. Specifically
	 *    this can happen when trying to pin framebuffers, which must only
	 *    be done when committing the state.
	 *
	 *  - -ENOSPC, as a refinement of the more generic -ENOMEM to indicate
	 *    that the driver has run out of vram, iommu space or similar GPU
	 *    address space needed for framebuffer.
	 *
	 *  - -EIO, if the hardware completely died.
	 *
	 *  - -EINTR, -EAGAIN or -ERESTARTSYS, if the IOCTL should be restarted.
	 *    This can either be due to a pending signal, or because the driver
	 *    needs to completely bail out to recover from an exceptional
	 *    situation like a GPU hang. From a userspace point of view all errors are
	 *    treated equally.
	 *
	 * This list is exhaustive. Specifically this hook is not allowed to
	 * return -EINVAL (any invalid requests should be caught in
	 * @atomic_check) or -EDEADLK (this function must not acquire
	 * additional modeset locks).
