	 *
	 * Supported values:
	 *
	 * TTM_TT_FLAG_SWAPPED: Set by TTM when the pages have been unpopulated
	 * and swapped out by TTM.  Calling ttm_tt_populate() will then swap the
	 * pages back in, and unset the flag. Drivers should in general never
	 * need to touch this.
	 *
	 * TTM_TT_FLAG_ZERO_ALLOC: Set if the pages will be zeroed on
	 * allocation.
	 *
	 * TTM_TT_FLAG_EXTERNAL: Set if the underlying pages were allocated
	 * externally, like with dma-buf or userptr. This effectively disables
	 * TTM swapping out such pages.  Also important is to prevent TTM from
	 * ever directly mapping these pages.
	 *
	 * Note that enum ttm_bo_type.ttm_bo_type_sg objects will always enable
	 * this flag.
	 *
	 * TTM_TT_FLAG_EXTERNAL_MAPPABLE: Same behaviour as
	 * TTM_TT_FLAG_EXTERNAL, but with the reduced restriction that it is
	 * still valid to use TTM to map the pages directly. This is useful when
	 * implementing a ttm_tt backend which still allocates driver owned
	 * pages underneath(say with shmem).
	 *
	 * Note that since this also implies TTM_TT_FLAG_EXTERNAL, the usage
	 * here should always be:
	 *
	 *   page_flags = TTM_TT_FLAG_EXTERNAL |
	 *		  TTM_TT_FLAG_EXTERNAL_MAPPABLE;
	 *
	 * TTM_TT_FLAG_DECRYPTED: The mapped ttm pages should be marked as
	 * not encrypted. The framework will try to match what the dma layer
	 * is doing, but note that it is a little fragile because ttm page
	 * fault handling abuses the DMA api a bit and dma_map_attrs can't be
	 * used to assure pgprot always matches.
	 *
	 * TTM_TT_FLAG_PRIV_POPULATED: TTM internal only. DO NOT USE. This is
	 * set by TTM after ttm_tt_populate() has successfully returned, and is
	 * then unset when TTM calls ttm_tt_unpopulate().
