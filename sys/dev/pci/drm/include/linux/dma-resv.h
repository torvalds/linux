 * enum dma_resv_usage - how the fences from a dma_resv obj are used
 *
 * This enum describes the different use cases for a dma_resv object and
 * controls which fences are returned when queried.
 *
 * An important fact is that there is the order KERNEL<WRITE<READ<BOOKKEEP and
 * when the dma_resv object is asked for fences for one use case the fences
 * for the lower use case are returned as well.
 *
 * For example when asking for WRITE fences then the KERNEL fences are returned
 * as well. Similar when asked for READ fences then both WRITE and KERNEL
 * fences are returned as well.
 *
 * Already used fences can be promoted in the sense that a fence with
 * DMA_RESV_USAGE_BOOKKEEP could become DMA_RESV_USAGE_READ by adding it again
 * with this usage. But fences can never be degraded in the sense that a fence
 * with DMA_RESV_USAGE_WRITE could become DMA_RESV_USAGE_READ.
