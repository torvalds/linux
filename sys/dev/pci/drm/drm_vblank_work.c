/**
 * DOC: vblank works
 *
 * Many DRM drivers need to program hardware in a time-sensitive manner, many
 * times with a deadline of starting and finishing within a certain region of
 * the scanout. Most of the time the safest way to accomplish this is to
 * simply do said time-sensitive programming in the driver's IRQ handler,
 * which allows drivers to avoid being preempted during these critical
 * regions. Or even better, the hardware may even handle applying such
 * time-critical programming independently of the CPU.
 *
 * While there's a decent amount of hardware that's designed so that the CPU
 * doesn't need to be concerned with extremely time-sensitive programming,
 * there's a few situations where it can't be helped. Some unforgiving
 * hardware may require that certain time-sensitive programming be handled
 * completely by the CPU, and said programming may even take too long to
 * handle in an IRQ handler. Another such situation would be where the driver
 * needs to perform a task that needs to complete within a specific scanout
 * period, but might possibly block and thus cannot be handled in an IRQ
 * context. Both of these situations can't be solved perfectly in Linux since
 * we're not a realtime kernel, and thus the scheduler may cause us to miss
 * our deadline if it decides to preempt us. But for some drivers, it's good
 * enough if we can lower our chance of being preempted to an absolute
 * minimum.
 *
 * This is where &drm_vblank_work comes in. &drm_vblank_work provides a simple
 * generic delayed work implementation which delays work execution until a
 * particular vblank has passed, and then executes the work at realtime
 * priority. This provides the best possible chance at performing
 * time-sensitive hardware programming on time, even when the system is under
 * heavy load. &drm_vblank_work also supports rescheduling, so that self
 * re-arming work items can be easily implemented.
