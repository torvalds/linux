/**
 * DOC: overview
 *
 * The KMS API doesn't standardize backing storage object creation and leaves it
 * to driver-specific ioctls. Furthermore actually creating a buffer object even
 * for GEM-based drivers is done through a driver-specific ioctl - GEM only has
 * a common userspace interface for sharing and destroying objects. While not an
 * issue for full-fledged graphics stacks that include device-specific userspace
 * components (in libdrm for instance), this limit makes DRM-based early boot
 * graphics unnecessarily complex.
 *
 * Dumb objects partly alleviate the problem by providing a standard API to
 * create dumb buffers suitable for scanout, which can then be used to create
 * KMS frame buffers.
 *
 * To support dumb objects drivers must implement the &drm_driver.dumb_create
 * and &drm_driver.dumb_map_offset operations (the latter defaults to
 * drm_gem_dumb_map_offset() if not set). Drivers that don't use GEM handles
 * additionally need to implement the &drm_driver.dumb_destroy operation. See
 * the callbacks for further details.
 *
 * Note that dumb objects may not be used for gpu acceleration, as has been
 * attempted on some ARM embedded platforms. Such drivers really must have
 * a hardware-specific ioctl to allocate suitable buffer objects.
