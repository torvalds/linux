/**
 * DOC: vma offset manager
 *
 * The vma-manager is responsible to map arbitrary driver-dependent memory
 * regions into the linear user address-space. It provides offsets to the
 * caller which can then be used on the address_space of the drm-device. It
 * takes care to not overlap regions, size them appropriately and to not
 * confuse mm-core by inconsistent fake vm_pgoff fields.
 * Drivers shouldn't use this for object placement in VMEM. This manager should
 * only be used to manage mappings into linear user-space VMs.
 *
 * We use drm_mm as backend to manage object allocations. But it is highly
 * optimized for alloc/free calls, not lookups. Hence, we use an rb-tree to
 * speed up offset lookups.
 *
 * You must not use multiple offset managers on a single address_space.
 * Otherwise, mm-core will be unable to tear down memory mappings as the VM will
 * no longer be linear.
 *
 * This offset manager works on page-based addresses. That is, every argument
 * and return code (with the exception of drm_vma_node_offset_addr()) is given
 * in number of pages, not number of bytes. That means, object sizes and offsets
 * must always be page-aligned (as usual).
 * If you want to get a valid byte-based user-space address for a given offset,
 * please see drm_vma_node_offset_addr().
 *
 * Additionally to offset management, the vma offset manager also handles access
 * management. For every open-file context that is allowed to access a given
 * node, you must call drm_vma_node_allow(). Otherwise, an mmap() call on this
 * open-file with the offset of the node will fail with -EACCES. To revoke
 * access again, use drm_vma_node_revoke(). However, the caller is responsible
 * for destroying already existing mappings, if required.
 */

 * drm_vma_offset_manager_init - Initialize new offset-manager

 *
 * Initialize a new offset-manager. The offset and area size available for the
 * manager are given as @page_offset and @size. Both are interpreted as
 * page-numbers, not bytes.
 *
 * Adding/removing nodes from the manager is locked internally and protected

 * for the caller. While calling into the vma-manager, a given node must

 * Returns NULL if no suitable node can be found. Otherwise, the best match
 * is returned. It's the caller's responsibility to make sure the node doesn't
 * get destroyed before the caller can access it.
