/**
 * DOC: Reservation Object Overview
 *
 * The reservation object provides a mechanism to manage a container of
 * dma_fence object associated with a resource. A reservation object
 * can have any number of fences attaches to it. Each fence carries an usage
 * parameter determining how the operation represented by the fence is using the
 * resource. The RCU mechanism is used to protect read access to fences from
 * locked write-side updates.
 *
 * See struct dma_resv for more details.
