/**
 * pmap_schedule() - Schedule time in a periodic bitmap (pmap).
 *
 * @map:             The bitmap representing the schedule; will be updated
 *                   upon success.
 * @bits_per_period: The schedule represents several periods.  This is how many
 *                   bits are in each period.  It's assumed that the beginning
 *                   of the schedule will repeat after its end.
 * @periods_in_map:  The number of periods in the schedule.
 * @num_bits:        The number of bits we need per period we want to reserve
 *                   in this function call.
 * @interval:        How often we need to be scheduled for the reservation this
 *                   time.  1 means every period.  2 means every other period.
 *                   ...you get the picture?
 * @start:           The bit number to start at.  Normally 0.  Must be within
 *                   the interval or we return failure right away.
 * @only_one_period: Normally we'll allow picking a start anywhere within the
 *                   first interval, since we can still make all repetition
 *                   requirements by doing that.  However, if you pass true
 *                   here then we'll return failure if we can't fit within
 *                   the period that "start" is in.
 *
 * The idea here is that we want to schedule time for repeating events that all
 * want the same resource.  The resource is divided into fixed-sized periods
 * and the events want to repeat every "interval" periods.  The schedule
 * granularity is one bit.
 *
 * To keep things "simple", we'll represent our schedule with a bitmap that
 * contains a fixed number of periods.  This gets rid of a lot of complexity
 * but does mean that we need to handle things specially (and non-ideally) if
 * the number of the periods in the schedule doesn't match well with the
 * intervals that we're trying to schedule.
 *
 * Here's an explanation of the scheme we'll implement, assuming 8 periods.
 * - If interval is 1, we need to take up space in each of the 8
 *   periods we're scheduling.  Easy.
 * - If interval is 2, we need to take up space in half of the
 *   periods.  Again, easy.
 * - If interval is 3, we actually need to fall back to interval 1.
 *   Why?  Because we might need time in any period.  AKA for the
 *   first 8 periods, we'll be in slot 0, 3, 6.  Then we'll be
 *   in slot 1, 4, 7.  Then we'll be in 2, 5.  Then we'll be back to
 *   0, 3, and 6.  Since we could be in any frame we need to reserve
 *   for all of them.  Sucks, but that's what you gotta do.  Note that
 *   if we were instead scheduling 8 * 3 = 24 we'd do much better, but
 *   then we need more memory and time to do scheduling.
 * - If interval is 4, easy.
 * - If interval is 5, we again need interval 1.  The schedule will be
 *   0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, 0
 * - If interval is 6, we need interval 2.  0, 6, 4, 2.
 * - If interval is 7, we need interval 1.
 * - If interval is 8, we need interval 8.
 *
 * If you do the math, you'll see that we need to pretend that interval is
 * equal to the greatest_common_divisor(interval, periods_in_map).
 *
 * Note that at the moment this function tends to front-pack the schedule.
 * In some cases that's really non-ideal (it's hard to schedule things that
 * need to repeat every period).  In other cases it's perfect (you can easily
 * schedule bigger, less often repeating things).
 *
 * Here's the algorithm in action (8 periods, 5 bits per period):

	 * A few things to note:
	 * - We compare against prev_frame_number since start_active_frame
	 *   and next_active_frame are always 1 frame before we want things
	 *   to be active and we assume we can still get scheduled in the
	 *   current frame number.
	 * - It's possible for start_active_frame (now incremented) to be
	 *   next_active_frame if we got an EO MISS (even_odd miss) which
	 *   basically means that we detected there wasn't enough time for
	 *   the last packet and dwc2_hc_set_even_odd_frame() rescheduled us
	 *   at the last second.  We want to make sure we don't schedule
	 *   another transfer for the same frame.  My test webcam doesn't seem
	 *   terribly upset by missing a transfer but really doesn't like when
	 *   we do two transfers in the same frame.
	 * - Some misses are expected.  Specifically, in order to work
	 *   perfectly dwc2 really needs quite spectacular interrupt latency
	 *   requirements.  It needs to be able to handle its interrupts
	 *   completely within 125 us of them being asserted. That not only
	 *   means that the dwc2 interrupt handler needs to be fast but it
	 *   means that nothing else in the system has to block dwc2 for a long
	 *   time.  We can help with the dwc2 parts of this, but it's hard to
	 *   guarantee that a system will have interrupt latency < 125 us, so
	 *   we have to be robust to some misses.
