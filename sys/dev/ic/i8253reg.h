 * Register definitions for the Intel 8253 Programmable Interval Timer.
 *
 * This chip has three independent 16-bit down counters that can be
 * read on the fly.  There are three mode registers and three countdown
 * registers.  The countdown registers are addressed directly, via the
 * first three I/O ports.  The three mode registers are accessed via
 * the fourth I/O port, with two bits in the mode byte indicating the
 * register.  (Why are hardware interfaces always so braindead?).
 *
 * To write a value into the countdown register, the mode register
 * is first programmed with a command indicating which byte of
 * the two byte register is to be modified.  The three possibilities
 * are load msb (TMR_MR_MSB), load lsb (TMR_MR_LSB), or load lsb then
 * msb (TMR_MR_BOTH).
 *
 * To read the current value ("on the fly") from the countdown register,
 * you write a "latch" command into the mode register, then read the stable
 * value from the corresponding I/O port.  For example, you write
 * TMR_MR_LATCH into the corresponding mode register.  Presumably,
 * after doing this, a write operation to the I/O port would result
 * in undefined behavior (but hopefully not fry the chip).
 * Reading in this manner has no side effects.
 *
 * The outputs of the three timers are connected as follows:
 *
 *	 timer 0 -> irq 0
 *	 timer 1 -> dma chan 0 (for dram refresh)
 * 	 timer 2 -> speaker (via keyboard controller)
 *
 * Timer 0 is used to call hardclock.
 * Timer 2 is used to generate console beeps.
