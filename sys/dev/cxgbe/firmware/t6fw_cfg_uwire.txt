# This file provides the default, power-on configuration for 2-port T6-based
# adapters shipped from the factory.  These defaults are designed to address
# the needs of the vast majority of Terminator customers.  The basic idea is to
# have a default configuration which allows a customer to plug a Terminator
# adapter in and have it work regardless of OS, driver or application except in
# the most unusual and/or demanding customer applications.
#
# Many of the Terminator resources which are described by this configuration
# are finite.  This requires balancing the configuration/operation needs of
# device drivers across OSes and a large number of customer application.
#
# Some of the more important resources to allocate and their constaints are:
#  1. Virtual Interfaces: 256.
#  2. Ingress Queues with Free Lists: 1024.
#  3. Egress Queues: 128K.
#  4. MSI-X Vectors: 1088.
#  5. Multi-Port Support (MPS) TCAM: 336 entries to support MAC destination
#     address matching on Ingress Packets.
#
# Some of the important OS/Driver resource needs are:
#  6. Some OS Drivers will manage all resources through a single Physical
#     Function (currently PF4 but it could be any Physical Function).
#  7. Some OS Drivers will manage different ports and functions (NIC,
#     storage, etc.) on different Physical Functions.  For example, NIC
#     functions for ports 0-1 on PF0-1, FCoE on PF4, iSCSI on PF5, etc.
#
# Some of the customer application needs which need to be accommodated:
#  8. Some customers will want to support large CPU count systems with
#     good scaling.  Thus, we'll need to accommodate a number of
#     Ingress Queues and MSI-X Vectors to allow up to some number of CPUs
#     to be involved per port and per application function.  For example,
#     in the case where all ports and application functions will be
#     managed via a single Unified PF and we want to accommodate scaling up
#     to 8 CPUs, we would want:
#
#         2 ports *
#         3 application functions (NIC, FCoE, iSCSI) per port *
#         16 Ingress Queue/MSI-X Vectors per application function
#
#     for a total of 96 Ingress Queues and MSI-X Vectors on the Unified PF.
#     (Plus a few for Firmware Event Queues, etc.)
#
#  9. Some customers will want to use PCI-E SR-IOV Capability to allow Virtual
#     Machines to directly access T6 functionality via SR-IOV Virtual Functions
#     and "PCI Device Passthrough" -- this is especially true for the NIC
#     application functionality.

# MPS features a 196608 bytes ingress buffer that is used for ingress buffering
# for packets from the wire as well as the loopback path of the L2 switch. The
# folling params control how the buffer memory is distributed and the L2 flow
# control settings:
#
# bg_mem:	%-age of mem to use for port/buffer group
# lpbk_mem:	%-age of port/bg mem to use for loopback
# hwm:		high watermark; bytes available when starting to send pause
#		frames (in units of 0.1 MTU)
# lwm:		low watermark; bytes remaining when sending 'unpause' frame
#		(in inuits of 0.1 MTU)
# dwm:		minimum delta between high and low watermark (in units of 100
#		Bytes)
