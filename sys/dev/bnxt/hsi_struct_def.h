/*
 * Description: This command allows configuration of a PF by the corresponding
 * PF driver. This command also allows configuration of a child VF by its parent
 * PF driver. The input FID value is used to indicate what function is being
 * configured. This allows a PF driver to configure the PF owned by itself or a
 * virtual function that is a child of the PF. This command allows to reserve
 * resources for a VF by its parent PF. To reverse the process, the command
 * should be called with all enables flags cleared for resources. This will free
 * allocated resources for the VF and return them to the resource pool. If this
 * command is requested by a VF driver to configure or reserve resources, then
 * the HWRM shall fail this command. If default MAC address and/or VLAN are
 * provided in this command, then the HWRM shall set up appropriate MAC/VLAN
 * filters for the function that is being configured. If source properties
 * checks are enabled and default MAC address and/or IP address are provided in
 * this command, then the HWRM shall set appropriate source property checks
 * based on provided MAC and/or IP addresses. The parent PF driver should not
 * set MTU/MRU for a VF using this command. This is to allow MTU/MRU setting by
 * the VF driver. If the MTU or MRU for a VF is set by the PF driver, then the
 * HWRM should ignore it. A function's MTU/MRU should be set prior to allocating
 * RX VNICs or TX rings. A PF driver calls hwrm_func_cfg to allocate resources
 * for itself or its children VFs. All function drivers shall call hwrm_func_cfg
 * to reserve resources. A request to hwrm_func_cfg may not be fully granted;
 * that is, a request for resources may be larger than what can be supported by
 * the device and the HWRM will allocate the best set of resources available,
 * but that may be less than requested. If all the amounts requested could not
 * be fulfilled, the HWRM shall allocate what it could and return a status code
 * of success. A function driver should call hwrm_func_qcfg immediately after
 * hwrm_func_cfg to determine what resources were assigned to the configured
 * function. A call by a PF driver to hwrm_func_cfg to allocate resources for
 * itself shall only allocate resources for the PF driver to use, not for its
 * children VFs. Likewise, a call to hwrm_func_qcfg shall return the resources
 * available for the PF driver to use, not what is available to its children
 * VFs.

/*
 * Description: This function is called by a driver to query the BW to CoS queue
 * mapping on the transmit side of a specific port. This mapping can be
 * different on different ports. Each CoS queue represents a Traffic Class (TC)
 * on that port. Each traffic class can be assigned a valid combination of the
 * following: - Minimum bandwidth - Maximum bandwidth - Transmission selection
 * algorithm (TSA) - Priority Level (only applies to strict priority COS) -
 * Bandwidth weight # A CoS can be SP or non-SP: A SP CoS always gets the strict
 * priority. Is an COS min BW is set to 0x0 then it is considered to be non-SP;
 * this is a valid configuration. Note: SP provides lower latency in addition to
 * reserved bandwidth # For both SP CoS and non-SP CoS, min BW can be specified
 * to reserve specific amount of the port BW. # The min BW specified for a CoS
 * shall not exceed max port bandwidth. # The total of min BWs specified for all
 * CoS shall not exceed max port bandwidth. # For any non-SP CoS, the minimum
 * bandwidth guarantees are subject to round-robin scheduling. This allows BW
 * reservation with anti-starvation; one CoS will not block another CoS using
 * RR. Note: The bandwidth guarantees for any non-SP CoS are met after servicing
 * all SP CoS. # An SP CoS can potentially starve other lower priority SP CoS
 * and non-SP CoS queues. This can occur to the extent the SP min exceeds the
 * available port BW. # For any CoS, max BW can be specified to limit the BW
 * consumed by the CoS. # The max BW specified for a CoS shall not exceed the
 * max port bandwidth. # The WFQ provides a mechanism for sharing available
 * bandwidth beyond the reserved minimums configured for each CoS. The WFQ
 * scheduler is used to provide the percentages of remaining bandwidth after: *
 * first servicing the reserved bandwidth for all SP CoS, * followed by the
 * reserved bandwidth for all non-SP CoS * All CoS may participate in the WFQ #
 * If a CoS does not have a configured max BW it may use all available bandwidth
 * up to the max port bandwidth Minimum Bandwidth (min BW): # This is the
 * guaranteed bandwidth for the COS. # A value of 0x0 is valid and it means that
 * this COS is not guaranteed any bandwidth. A value of 0xFF.. (all Fs) means
 * min BW is not specified. When the min BW is not specified, the HWRM can set
 * it to any value it considers appropriate. Note: For a non-SP COS, the HWRM
 * should set min BW to 0 when the min BW is not specified. For an SP COS, the
 * HWRM should set min BW to some small value when the min BW is not specified.
 * Maximum Bandwidth: # This is the bandwidth limit of the COS. # Values 0x0 and
 * 0xFF.. (all Fs) are considered unspecified and the HWRM will set the maximum
 * bandwidth to maximum port bandwidth. Priority Level: # It applies only to SP.
 * # This parameter is ignored for non-SP. # 0-7 are valid values (higher value
 * means higher priority) # A priority level can be assigned to at most one SP.
 * # Invalid priority levels assignment for SPs shall result in failure.
 * Additional notes: # The HWRM may have to use min and (max - min) to set
 * appropriate counters of hardware rate limiters. # The bandwidth percentage as
 * specified in the DCB TC BW assignment should be used by the driver to specify
 * maximum bandwidth and bandwidth weight for a COS. For example, the driver
 * should set max BW to 20 Gbps and weight to 50 for two COSs when these two
 * COSs are assigned 50% share of 40 Gbps max port bandwidth.

/*
 * Description: This function is called by a driver to configure the BW to CoS
 * queue mapping on the transmit side of a specific port. This mapping can be
 * different on different ports. Each CoS queue represents a Traffic Class (TC)
 * on that port. Each traffic class can be assigned a valid combination of the
 * following: - Minimum bandwidth - Maximum bandwidth - Transmission selection
 * algorithm (TSA) - Priority Level (only applies to strict priority COS) -
 * Bandwidth weight # A CoS can be SP or non-SP: A SP CoS always gets the strict
 * priority. Note: SP provides lower latency in addition to reserved bandwidth #
 * For non-SP CoS, min BW can be specified to reserve specific amount of the
 * port BW. # The min BW specified for a CoS shall not exceed max port
 * bandwidth. # The total of min BWs specified for all CoS shall not exceed max
 * port bandwidth. # For any non-SP CoS, the minimum bandwidth guarantees are
 * subject to round-robin scheduling. This allows BW reservation with anti-
 * starvation; one CoS will not block another CoS using RR. Note: The bandwidth
 * guarantees for any non-SP CoS are met after servicing all SP CoS. # An SP CoS
 * can potentially starve other lower priority SP CoS and non-SP CoS queues.
 * This can occur to the extent the SP min exceeds the available port BW. # For
 * any CoS, max BW can be specified to limit the BW consumed by the CoS. # A max
 * BW can be used for a SP CoS to limit the starvation of other CoS, but using
 * this will cause some characteristics of any ETS CoS to be violated. # The max
 * BW specified for a CoS shall not exceed the max port bandwidth. # For SP CoS,
 * it is recommended to set min and max BW to 0. This instructs the adapter to
 * use default values. # The WFQ provides a mechanism for sharing available
 * bandwidth beyond the reserved minimums configured for each CoS. The WFQ
 * scheduler is used to provide the percentages of remaining bandwidth after: -
 * first servicing the reserved bandwidth for all SP CoS, - followed by the
 * reserved bandwidth for all non-SP CoS - All CoS may participate in the WFQ #
 * If a CoS does not have a configured max BW it may use all available bandwidth
 * up to the max port bandwidth Minimum Bandwidth (min BW): # This is the
 * guaranteed bandwidth for the COS. # A value of 0x0 is valid and it means that
 * this COS is not guaranteed any bandwidth. A value of 0xFF.. (all Fs) means
 * min BW is not specified. When the min BW is not specified, the HWRM can set
 * it to any value it considers appropriate. Note: For a non-SP COS, the HWRM
 * should set min BW to 0 when the min BW is not specified. For an SP COS, min
 * BW value is ignored. Maximum Bandwidth: # This is the bandwidth limit of the
 * COS. # Values 0x0 and 0xFF.. (all Fs) are considered unspecified and the HWRM
 * will set the maximum bandwidth to maximum port bandwidth. Priority Level: #
 * It applies only to SP. # This parameter is ignored for non-SP. # 0-7 are
 * valid values (higher value means higher priority) # A priority level can be
 * assigned to at most one SP. # Invalid priority levels assignment for SPs
 * shall result in failure. Additional notes: # The HWRM may have to use min and
 * (max - min) to set appropriate counters of hardware rate limiters. # The

/* hwrm_cfa_l2_filter_alloc */

 * Description: An L2 filter is a filter resource that is used to identify a
 * vnic or ring for a packet based on layer 2 fields. Layer 2 fields for
 * encapsulated packets include both outer L2 header and/or inner l2 header of
 * encapsulated packet. The L2 filter resource covers the following OS specific
 * L2 filters. Linux/FreeBSD (per function): # Broadcast enable/disable # List
 * of individual multicast filters # All multicast enable/disable filter #
 * Unicast filters # Promiscuous mode VMware: # Broadcast enable/disable (per
 * physical function) # All multicast enable/disable (per function) # Unicast
 * filters per ring or vnic # Promiscuous mode per PF Windows: # Broadcast
 * enable/disable (per physical function) # List of individual multicast filters
 * (Driver needs to advertise the maximum number of filters supported) # All
 * multicast enable/disable per physical function # Unicast filters per vnic #
 * Promiscuous mode per PF Implementation notes on the use of VNIC in this
 * command: # By default, these filters belong to default vnic for the function.
 * # Once these filters are set up, only destination VNIC can be modified. # If
 * the destination VNIC is not specified in this command, then the HWRM shall
 * only create an l2 context id. HWRM Implementation notes for multicast
 * filters: # The hwrm_filter_alloc command can be used to set up multicast
 * filters (perfect match or partial match). Each individual function driver can
 * set up multicast filters independently. # The HWRM needs to keep track of
 * multicast filters set up by function drivers and maintain multicast group
 * replication records to enable a subset of functions to receive traffic for a
 * specific multicast address. # When a specific multicast filter cannot be set,
 * the HWRM shall return an error. In this error case, the driver should fall
 * back to using one general filter (rather than specific) for all multicast
 * traffic. # When the SR-IOV is enabled, the HWRM needs to additionally track
 * source knockout per multicast group record. Examples of setting unicast
 * filters: For a unicast MAC based filter, one can use a combination of the
 * fields and masks provided in this command to set up the filter. Below are
 * some examples: # MAC + no VLAN filter: This filter is used to identify
 * traffic that does not contain any VLAN tags and matches destination (or
 * source) MAC address. This filter can be set up by setting only l2_addr field
 * to be a valid field. All other fields are not valid. The following value is
 * set for l2_addr. l2_addr = MAC # MAC + Any VLAN filter: This filter is used
 * to identify traffic that carries single VLAN tag and matches (destination or
 * source) MAC address. This filter can be set up by setting only l2_addr and
 * l2_ovlan_mask fields to be valid fields. All other fields are not valid. The
 * following values are set for those two valid fields. l2_addr = MAC,
