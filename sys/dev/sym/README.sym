 *  Device driver optimized for the Symbios/LSI 53C896/53C895A/53C1010 
 *  PCI-SCSI controllers.
 *
 *  Copyright (C) 1999-2001  Gerard Roudier <groudier@free.fr>
 *
 *  This driver also supports the following Symbios/LSI PCI-SCSI chips:
 *	53C810A, 53C825A, 53C860, 53C875, 53C876, 53C885, 53C895,
 *	53C810,  53C815,  53C825 and the 53C1510D is 53C8XX mode.
 *
 *  
 *  This driver for FreeBSD-CAM is derived from the Linux sym53c8xx driver.
 *  Copyright (C) 1998-1999  Gerard Roudier
 *
 *  The sym53c8xx driver is derived from the ncr53c8xx driver that had been 
 *  a port of the FreeBSD ncr driver to Linux-1.2.13.
 *
 *  The original ncr driver has been written for 386bsd and FreeBSD by
 *          Wolfgang Stanglmeier        <wolf@cologne.de>
 *          Stefan Esser                <se@mi.Uni-Koeln.de>
 *  Copyright (C) 1994  Wolfgang Stanglmeier
 *
 *  The initialisation code, and part of the code that addresses 
 *  FreeBSD-CAM services is based on the aic7xxx driver for FreeBSD-CAM 
 *  written by Justin T. Gibbs.

README.sym
----------
This file was bundled with the `sym' driver source files, when 
the driver was in development stage and not included yet into 
the FreeBSD repository. It described how to install the driver, 
gave informations on driver features and summerized important 
changes between versions. These informations are now available 
using `man sym' for driver usage and features description, and 
`cvs log' for driver changes.

I haven't removed this README file from the repository since 
I may have to provide additional documentation to people 
interested in understanding the driver sources and/or in helping 
driver development and maintenance.

As a result, this file is now under reconstruction. :-)
