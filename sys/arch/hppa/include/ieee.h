 * Note that  1.0 x 2  == 0.1 x 2      and that denorms are represented
 *
 *					  (-exp_bias+1)
 * as fractions that look like 0.fffff x 2             .  This means that
 *
 *			 -126
 * the number 0.10000 x 2    , for instance, is the same as the normalized
 *
 *		-127			   -128
 * float 1.0 x 2    .  Thus, to represent 2    , we need one leading zero
 *
 *				  -129
 * in the fraction; to represent 2    , we need two, and so on.  This
 *
 *						     (-exp_bias-fracbits+1)
 * implies that the smallest denormalized number is 2
 *
 * for whichever format we are talking about: for single precision, for
 *
 *						-126		-149
 * instance, we get .00000000000000000000001 x 2    , or 1.0 x 2    , and

 * -149 == -127 - 23 + 1.
