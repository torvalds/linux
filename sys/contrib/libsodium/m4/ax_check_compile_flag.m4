# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG(FLAG, [ACTION-SUCCESS], [ACTION-FAILURE], [EXTRA-FLAGS])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Check whether the given FLAG works with the current language's compiler
#   or gives an error.  (Warnings, however, are ignored)
#
#   ACTION-SUCCESS/ACTION-FAILURE are shell commands to execute on
#   success/failure.
#
#   If EXTRA-FLAGS is defined, it is added to the current language's default
#   flags (e.g. CFLAGS) when the check is done.  The check is thus made with
#   the flags: "CFLAGS EXTRA-FLAGS FLAG".  This can for example be used to
#   force the compiler to issue an error when a bad flag is given.
#
#   INPUT gives an alternative input source to AC_COMPILE_IFELSE.
#
#   NOTE: Implementation based on AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION. Please keep this
#   macro in sync with AX_CHECK_{PREPROC,LINK}_FLAG.
