/*
 * Structure that must be initialized for a diskless nfs client.
 * This structure is used by nfs_mountroot() to set up the root vnode,
 * and to do a partial ifconfig(8) and route(8) so that the critical net
 * interface can communicate with the server.
 * The primary bootstrap is expected to fill in the appropriate fields before
 * starting the kernel.
 * Currently only works for AF_INET protocols.
 * NB: All fields are stored in net byte order to avoid hassles with
 * client/server byte ordering differences.

/*
 * I have defined a new structure that can handle an NFS Version 3 file handle
 * but the kernel still expects the old Version 2 one to be provided. The
 * changes required in nfs_vfsops.c for using the new are documented there in
 * comments. (I felt that breaking network booting code by changing this
 * structure would not be prudent at this time, since almost all servers are
 * still Version 2 anyhow.)
