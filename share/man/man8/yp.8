.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm YP
subsystem allows network management of passwd, group, and
hosts file entries through the functions
.Xr getpwent 3 ,
.Xr getgrent 3
and
.Xr gethostbyname 3 .
A number of other databases can be network-managed as well,
and have their respective functions.
.Nm YP
also provides hooks for numerous other client programs
such as
.Xr amd 8
and
.Xr rpc.bootparamd 8
to access distributed and shareable versions
of their maps through
.Nm YP .
The YP subsystem requires that
.Xr portmap 8
be running, since the entire subsystem uses the RPC subsystem.
.Pp
.Nm ypinit
is used to initialize
.Nm YP
as a master or a slave.
This creates various files in
.Pa /var/yp .
After running
.Nm ypinit Fl m ,
optionally edit
.Pa /var/yp/DOMAINNAME/Makefile
to change settings, for example to switch from the default
backwards compatible mode to secure mode.
Finally, always run
.Xr make 1
in
.Pa /var/yp .
See
.Xr Makefile.yp 8
for details.
.Pp
If set up as a slave, the required databases are automatically copied
from the specified server.
.Pp
The
.Nm YP
client subsystem is started automatically in
.Pa /etc/rc
if the directory
.Pa /var/yp/binding
exists.
The client subsystem can be turned on and off by creating or
deleting that directory.
.Xr ypbind 8
will create that directory if run by hand.
.Pp
The
.Nm YP
server subsystem is started automatically in
.Pa /etc/rc
if the directory
.Pa /var/yp/DOMAINNAME
exists.
This directory is automatically created by
.Xr ypinit 8
(which initializes the machine as a
.Nm YP
server).
.Pp
If
.Nm ypbind
cannot find a server, the system behaves the same way as Sun's code
does: it hangs.

.Sh HISTORY
This free
.Nm YP
subsystem is thought to be compatible with Sun's implementation.
It is, of course, not compatible with
.Nm NIS+
or any other
.Dq secure
.Nm YP
subsystem other than the native one.
.Pp
The name
.Nm YP
stands for Yellow Pee.
.Pp
The ypbind, most library components, and userland programs were implemented
by
.An Theo de Raadt Aq Mt deraadt@theos.com .
The current
.Xr getpwent 3
implementation was done by
.An Jason Downs Aq Mt downsj@downsj.com .
The server component was implemented by
.An Mats O Jansson Aq Mt moj@stacken.kth.se .
