.Sh NAME
.Nm intro
.Nd "introduction to system maintenance procedures and commands"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This section contains information related to system operation
and maintenance.
.Pp
It describes commands used to create new file systems
.Pq Xr newfs 8 ,
verify the integrity of the file systems
.Pq Xr fsck 8 ,
control disk usage
.Pq Xr edquota 8 ,
maintain system backups
.Pq Xr dump 8 ,
and recover files when disks die an untimely death
.Pq Xr restore 8 .
.\" The
.\" .Xr format 8
.\" manual
.\" for the specific architecture the system is running on should be
.\" consulted when formatting disks and tapes.
Network related services like
.Xr inetd 8
and
.Xr ftpd 8
are also described.
.Pp
All commands set an exit status.
Its value may be tested
to see if the command completed normally.
Unless otherwise noted (rare), the value 0 signifies successful
completion of the command, while a value >0 indicates an error.
Some commands attempt to describe the nature of the failure by using
error codes defined in
.Xr sysexits 3 ,
or set the status to arbitrary values >0 (typically 1), but many
such values are not described in the manual.
.Pp
A number of pages in this section describe general system
management topics.
.Pp
For example, the
.Xr boot 8
manual page describes the system bootstrapping procedures,
and the
.Xr diskless 8
manual page describes how to boot a system over a network.
The
.Xr crash 8
manual page
should be consulted to understand how to interpret system
crash dumps.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
section manual page appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
