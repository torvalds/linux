.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
keyboard driver provides support for basic keyboard multiplexing.
It is built around the idea of a
.Dq "super keyboard" .
The
.Nm
driver
acts as a master keyboard consuming input from all slave keyboards attached to
it.
.Pp
Slave keyboards can be attached to or detached from the
.Nm
keyboard driver with the
.Xr kbdcontrol 1
utility.

.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
keyboard driver switches all slave keyboards into
.Dv K_RAW
mode.
Thus all slave keyboards attached to the
.Nm
keyboard share the same state.
The
.Nm
keyboard is logically equivalent to one keyboard with lots of duplicated keys.
