.Sh NAME
.Nm ccr
.Nd "Chelsio T6 crypto accelerator driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indeunt
.Cd "device ccr"
.Ed
.Pp
To load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ccr_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the crypto accelerator engine included on
PCI Express Ethernet adapters based on the Chelsio Terminator 6 ASIC (T6).
The driver accelerates AES-CBC, AES-CTR, AES-GCM, AES-XTS, SHA1, SHA2-224,
SHA2-256, SHA2-384, SHA2-512, SHA1-HMAC, SHA2-224-HMAC,
SHA2-256-HMAC, SHA2-384-HMAC, and SHA2-512-HMAC operations for
.Xr crypto 4
and
.Xr ipsec 4 .
The driver also supports chaining one of AES-CBC, AES-CTR, or AES-XTS with
SHA1-HMAC, SHA2-224-HMAC, SHA2-256-HMAC, SHA2-384-HMAC, or SHA2-512-HMAC for
encrypt-then-authenticate operations.
For further hardware information and questions related to hardware
requirements, see
.Pa http://www.chelsio.com/ .
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver attaches as a child of an existing Chelsio NIC device and thus
requires that the
.Xr cxgbe 4
driver be active.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the crypto accelerator engine included on adapters
based on the T6 ASIC:
