.Sh NAME
.Nm vmx
.Nd VMware VMXNET3 Virtual Interface Controller device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd vmx* at pci?
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the VMXNET3 virtual NIC available in virtual
machines by VMware.
It appears as a simple Ethernet device but is actually a virtual network
interface to the underlying host operating system.
.Pp
This driver supports the
.Ic VMXNET3
driver protocol, as an alternative to the emulated
.Xr pcn 4 ,
.Xr em 4
and the earlier VMXNET
.Xr vic 4
interfaces also available in the VMware environment.
The
.Nm vmx
driver is optimized for the virtual machine, it can provide advanced
capabilities depending on the underlying host operating system and
the physical network interface controller of the host.
In comparison to the earlier VMXNET versions,
as supported by the
.Xr vic 4
driver,
VMXNET3 supports additional features like multiqueue support, IPv6
checksum offloading, MSI/MSI-X support and hardware VLAN tagging in
VMware's VLAN Guest Tagging (VGT) mode.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports VMXNET3 VMware virtual NICs provided by the virtual
machine hardware version 7 or newer, as provided by the following
products:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
VMware ESX/ESXi 4.0 and newer
.It
VMware Server 2.0 and newer
.It
VMware Workstation 6.5 and newer
.It
VMware Fusion 2.0 and newer
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width autoselect
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The driver always uses the fastest available speed and the media
options provided by the underlying host of the virtual machine.
.It 10GbaseT mediaopt full-duplex
Set 10Gbps operation.
.It 1000baseT mediaopt full-duplex
Set 1000Mbps operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following entry must be added to the VMware configuration file
to provide the
.Nm
device:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet3"
