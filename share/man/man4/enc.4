.Dt ENC 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm enc
.Nd Encapsulating Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device enc"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_enc_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface is a software loopback mechanism that allows hosts or
firewalls to filter
.Xr ipsec 4
traffic using any firewall package that hooks in via the
.Xr pfil 9
framework.
.Pp
The
.Nm
interface allows an administrator to see incoming and outgoing packets
before and after they will be or have been processed by
.Xr ipsec 4
via
.Xr tcpdump 1 .
.Pp
The
.Dq Li enc0
interface inherits all IPsec traffic.
Thus all IPsec traffic can be filtered based on
.Dq Li enc0 ,
and all IPsec traffic could be seen by invoking
.Xr tcpdump 1
on the
.Dq Li enc0
interface.
.Pp
What can be seen with
.Xr tcpdump 1
and what will be passed on to the firewalls via the
.Xr pfil 9
framework can be independently controlled using the following
.Xr sysctl 8
variables:
.Bl -column net.enc.out.ipsec_filter_mask 0x00000000 0x00000000
.It Sy "Name	Defaults	Suggested"
.It "net.enc.out.ipsec_bpf_mask	0x00000003	0x00000001"
.It "net.enc.out.ipsec_filter_mask	0x00000001	0x00000001"
.It "net.enc.in.ipsec_bpf_mask	0x00000001	0x00000002"
.It "net.enc.in.ipsec_filter_mask	0x00000001	0x00000002"
.El
.Pp
For the incoming path a value of
.Li 0x1
means
.Dq Li before stripping off the outer header
and
.Li 0x2
means
.Dq Li after stripping off the outer header .
For the outgoing path
.Li 0x1
means
.Dq Li with only the inner header
and
.Li 0x2
means
.Dq Li with outer and inner headers .
.Bd -literal
incoming path                                          |------|
---- IPsec processing ---- (before) ---- (after) ----> |      |
                                                       | Host |
<--- IPsec processing ---- (after) ----- (before) ---- |      |
outgoing path                                          |------|
.Ed
.Pp
Most people will want to run with the suggested defaults for
.Cm ipsec_filter_mask
and rely on the security policy database for the outer headers.
.Pp
Note that packets are captured by BPF before firewall processing.
The special value 0x4 can be configured in the
.Ar ipsec_bpf_mask
and packets will be also captured after firewall processing.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To see the packets the processed via
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
adjust the
.Xr sysctl 8
variables according to your need and run:
.Pp
.Dl "tcpdump -i enc0"
