.Sh NAME
.Nm nsclpcsio
.Nd National Semiconductor PC87366 LPC Super I/O with GPIO
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "nsclpcsio* at isa?"
.Cd "gpio* at nsclpcsio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the National Semiconductor PC87366 LPC Super I/O.
The Super I/O module incorporates several logical devices, the following
ones are supported: GPIO, VLM and TMS.
.Pp
The GPIO logical device provides 29 I/O pins which can be accessed
through the
.Xr gpio 4
framework.
The
.Xr gpioctl 8
program allows easy manipulation of the pins from userland.
.Pp
VLM and TMS logical devices provides hardware monitoring capabilities
to be used with the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.
The following 17 monitoring sensors are available:
