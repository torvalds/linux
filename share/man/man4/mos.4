.Sh NAME
.Nm mos
.Nd Moschip MCS7730/MCS7830/MCS7832 USB Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device ehci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device miibus"
.Cd "device uether"
.Cd "device mos"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_mos_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the
Moschip MCS7730/MCS7830/MCS7832 chipset.
.Pp
The adapters that contain the Moschip MCS7730/MCS7830/MCS7832 chipset
will operate at 100Base-TX and full-duplex.
.Pp
The Moschip contains a 10/100
Ethernet MAC with MII interface and is designed to work with both
Ethernet and HomePNA transceivers.
Although designed to interface with
100Mbps peripherals, this only works with USB 2.0. The existing USB 1.0
standard specifies a maximum transfer speed of 12Mbps.
USB 1.0 Users should therefore not expect to actually achieve 100Mbps speeds
with these devices.
.Pp
The Moschip supports a 64-bit multicast hash table, single perfect
filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
