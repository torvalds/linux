.Pp
Driver features include support for twin and wide buses,
fast, ultra, ultra2 and ultra160 synchronous transfers depending on
controller type, tagged queuing, and SCB paging, and target mode.
.Pp
Memory mapped I/O can be enabled for PCI devices with the
.Dq Dv AHC_ALLOW_MEMIO
configuration option.
Memory mapped I/O is more efficient than the alternative, programmed I/O.
Most PCI BIOSes will map devices so that either technique for communicating
with the card is available.
In some cases,
usually when the PCI device is sitting behind a PCI->PCI bridge,
the BIOS may fail to properly initialize the chip for memory mapped I/O.
The typical symptom of this problem is a system hang if memory mapped I/O
is attempted.
Most modern motherboards perform the initialization correctly and work fine
with this option enabled.
This is the default mode of operation on every architecture except i386.
.Pp
Individual controllers may be configured to operate in the target role through
the
.Dq Dv AHC_TMODE_ENABLE
configuration option.
The value assigned to this option should be a bitmap of all units where target
mode is desired.
For example, a value of 0x25, would enable target mode on units 0, 2, and 5.
A value of 0x8a enables it for units 1, 3, and 7.
.Pp
Per target configuration performed in the
.Tn SCSI-Select
menu, accessible at boot
in
.No non- Ns Tn EISA
models,
or through an
.Tn EISA
configuration utility for
.Tn EISA
models,
is honored by this driver.
This includes synchronous/asynchronous transfers,
maximum synchronous negotiation rate,
wide transfers,
disconnection,
the host adapter's SCSI ID,
and,
in the case of
.Tn EISA
Twin Channel controllers,
the primary channel selection.
For systems that store non-volatile settings in a system specific manner
rather than a serial eeprom directly connected to the aic7xxx controller,
the
.Tn BIOS
must be enabled for the driver to access this information.
This restriction applies to all
.Tn EISA
and many motherboard configurations.
.Pp
Note that I/O addresses are determined automatically by the probe routines,
but care should be taken when using a 284x
.Pq Tn VESA No local bus controller
in an
.Tn EISA
system.
The jumpers setting the I/O area for the 284x should match the
.Tn EISA
slot into which the card is inserted to prevent conflicts with other
.Tn EISA
cards.
.Pp
Performance and feature sets vary throughout the aic7xxx product line.
The following table provides a comparison of the different chips supported by
the
.Nm
driver.
Note that wide and twin channel features, although always supported by a
particular chip, may be disabled in a particular motherboard or card design.

.Sh SCSI CONTROL BLOCKS (SCBs)
Every transaction sent to a device on the SCSI bus is assigned a
.Sq SCSI Control Block
(SCB).
The SCB contains all of the information required by the controller to process a
transaction.
The chip feature table lists the number of SCBs that can be stored in on-chip
memory.
All chips with model numbers greater than or equal to 7870 allow for the
on-chip SCB space to be augmented with external SRAM up to a maximum of 255
SCBs.
Very few Adaptec controller configurations have external SRAM.
.Pp
If external SRAM is not available,
SCBs are a limited resource.
Using the SCBs in a straight forward manner would only allow the driver to
handle as many concurrent transactions as there are physical SCBs.
To fully utilize the SCSI bus and the devices on it,
requires much more concurrency.
The solution to this problem is
.Em SCB Paging ,
a concept similar to memory paging.
SCB paging takes advantage of the fact that devices usually disconnect from the
SCSI bus for long periods of time without talking to the controller.
The SCBs for disconnected transactions are only of use to the controller when
the transfer is resumed.
When the host queues another transaction for the controller to execute,
the controller firmware will use a free SCB if one is available.
Otherwise, the state of the most recently disconnected (and therefore most
likely to stay disconnected) SCB is saved, via DMA, to host memory,
and the local SCB reused to start the new transaction.
This allows the controller to queue up to 255 transactions regardless of the
amount of SCB space.
Since the local SCB space serves as a cache for disconnected transactions,
the more SCB space available, the less host bus traffic consumed saving and
restoring SCB data.

.Sh AUTHORS
The core
.Nm
driver, the
.Tn AIC7xxx
sequencer-code assembler, and the firmware running on the aic7xxx chips
were written by
.An Justin T. Gibbs .
.Pp
The
.Ox
platform dependent code was written by Steve P. Murphree, Jr and Kenneth
R. Westerback.
.Sh BUGS
Some Quantum drives (at least the Empire 2100 and 1080s) will not run on an
.Tn AIC7870
Rev B in synchronous mode at 10MHz.
Controllers with this problem have a 42 MHz clock crystal on them and run
slightly above 10MHz.
This confuses the drive and hangs the bus.
Setting a maximum synchronous negotiation rate of 8MHz in the
.Tn SCSI-Select
utility will allow normal operation.
.Pp
Although the Ultra2 and Ultra160 products have sufficient instruction RAM space
to support both the initiator and target roles concurrently,
this configuration is disabled in favor of allowing the target role to respond
on multiple target ids.
A method for configuring dual role mode should be provided.
.Pp
Tagged Queuing is not supported in target mode.
.Pp
Reselection in target mode fails to function correctly on all high voltage
differential boards as shipped by Adaptec.
Information on how to modify HVD board to work correctly in target mode is
available from Adaptec.
