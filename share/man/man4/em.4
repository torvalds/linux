The
.Nm
driver supports IPv4 receive IP/TCP/UDP checksum offload and transmit TCP/UDP
checksum offload on all but 82542-based adapters, VLAN tag insertion and
stripping, and jumbo frames on all but 82562V, 82566DC/82566DM and
82573E/82573L/82573V-based adapters.
The 82562V Ethernet controller chip only supports 10/100 media types.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width autoselect -offset indent
.It autoselect
Enables auto-negotiation for speed and duplex.
.It 10baseT Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Sets 10Mbps operation.
.It 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Sets 100Mbps operation.
.It 1000baseLX
Sets 1000Mbps operation.
Only full-duplex mode is supported at this speed.
.It 1000baseSX
Sets 1000Mbps operation.
Only full-duplex mode is supported at this speed.
.It 1000baseT
Sets 1000Mbps operation.
Only full-duplex mode is supported at this speed.

driver was written by
.An Intel Corporation .
.Sh BUGS
There are known performance issues with this driver when running UDP traffic
with jumbo frames.
.Pp
There is a known compatibility issue where time to link is slow or link is not
established between 82541/82547 controllers and some switches.
Known switches include:
