.Sh NAME
.Nm ahd
.Nd Adaptec PCI/PCI-X AIC79xx-based Ultra320 SCSI interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ahd* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides access to the
.Tn SCSI
bus(es) connected to Adaptec
.Tn AIC79xx
host adapter chips.
.Pp
.Nm
supports narrow and wide buses; synchronous and
asynchronous operation; fast, ultra, ultra2, ultra160, and ultra320
(packetized) transfers; tagged queuing and 512 SCBs.
.Pp
.Nm
does not support target mode operation.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
Adaptec
.Tn AIC7901
host adapter chip
.It
Adaptec
.Tn AIC7901A
host adapter chip
.It
Adaptec
.Tn AIC7902
host adapter chip
.It
Adaptec
.Tn 29320
host adapter
.It
Adaptec
.Tn 39320
host adapter
.It
Many motherboards with on-board
.Tn SCSI
support
.El
.Pp
To compile in debugging code:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd option AHD_DEBUG
.Cd option AHD_DEBUG_OPTS=<bitmask of options>
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Dv AHD_DEBUG_OPTS
option is used to control which diagnostic messages are printed to the
console when
.Dv AHD_DEBUG
is enabled.
Logically OR the following bits together:
.Bl -column "0x0001" "Function" -offset indent
.It Em Value Ta Em Function
.It 0x0001 Ta "Show miscellaneous information"
.It 0x0002 Ta "Show sense data"
.It 0x0004 Ta "Show Serial EEPROM contents"
.It 0x0008 Ta "Show bus termination settings"
.It 0x0010 Ta "Show host memory usage"
.It 0x0020 Ta "Show SCSI protocol messages"
.It 0x0040 Ta "Show mode pointer of the chip register window"
.It 0x0080 Ta "Show selection timeouts"
.It 0x0100 Ta "Show FIFO usage messages"
.It 0x0200 Ta "Show Queue Full status"
.It 0x0400 Ta "Show SCB queue status"
.It 0x0800 Ta "Show inbound packet information"
.It 0x1000 Ta "Show S/G list information"
.It 0x2000 Ta "Enable extra diagnostic code in the firmware"
.El
.Pp
Per target configuration performed in the
.Tn SCSI-Select
menu, accessible at boot,
is honored by this driver.
This includes synchronous/asynchronous transfers,
maximum synchronous negotiation rate,
wide transfers,
disconnection,
and the host adapters
.Tn SCSI
ID.

The
.Nm
driver, the
.Tn AIC7xxx
sequencer-code assembler,
and the firmware running on the aic79xx chips was written by
.An Justin T. Gibbs .
