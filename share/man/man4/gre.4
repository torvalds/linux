.Dt GRE 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm gre
.Nd encapsulating network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile the
driver into the kernel, place the following line in the kernel
configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device gre"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the
driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_gre_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
network interface pseudo device encapsulates datagrams
into IP.
These encapsulated datagrams are routed to a destination host,
where they are decapsulated and further routed to their final destination.
The
.Dq tunnel
appears to the inner datagrams as one hop.
.Pp
.Nm
interfaces are dynamically created and destroyed with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm create
and
.Cm destroy
subcommands.
.Pp
This driver corresponds to RFC 2784.
Encapsulated datagrams are prepended an outer datagram and a GRE header.
The GRE header specifies
the type of the encapsulated datagram and thus allows for tunneling other
protocols than IP.
GRE mode is also the default tunnel mode on Cisco routers.
.Nm
also supports Cisco WCCP protocol, both version 1 and version 2.
.Pp
The
.Nm
interfaces support a number of additional parameters to the
.Xr ifconfig 8 :
.Bl -tag -width "enable_csum"
.It Ar grekey
Set the GRE key used for outgoing packets.
A value of 0 disables the key option.
.It Ar enable_csum
Enables checksum calculation for outgoing packets.
.It Ar enable_seq
Enables use of sequence number field in the GRE header for outgoing packets.

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal
192.168.1.* --- Router A  -------tunnel-------- Router B --- 192.168.2.*
                   \\                              /
                    \\                            /
                     +------ the Internet ------+
.Ed
.Pp
Assuming router A has the (external) IP address A and the internal address
192.168.1.1, while router B has external address B and internal address
192.168.2.1, the following commands will configure the tunnel:
.Pp
On router A:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig greN create
ifconfig greN inet 192.168.1.1 192.168.2.1
ifconfig greN inet tunnel A B
route add -net 192.168.2 -netmask 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1
.Ed
.Pp
On router B:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig greN create
ifconfig greN inet 192.168.2.1 192.168.1.1
ifconfig greN inet tunnel B A
route add -net 192.168.1 -netmask 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1
.Ed
.Pp
In case when internal and external IP addresses are the same,
different routing tables (FIB) should be used.
The default FIB will be applied to IP packets before GRE encapsulation.
After encapsulation GRE interface should set different FIB number to
outgoing packet.
Then different FIB will be applied to such encapsulated packets.
According to this FIB packet should be routed to tunnel endpoint.
.Bd -literal
Host X -- Host A (198.51.100.1) ---tunnel--- Cisco D (203.0.113.1) -- Host E
                   \\                                   /
                    \\                                 /
	             +----- Host B ----- Host C -----+
                       (198.51.100.254)
.Ed
.Pp
On Host A (FreeBSD):
.Pp
First of multiple FIBs should be configured via loader.conf:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
net.fibs=2
net.add_addr_allfibs=0
.Ed
.Pp
Then routes to the gateway and remote tunnel endpoint via this gateway
should be added to the second FIB:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
route add -net 198.51.100.0 -netmask 255.255.255.0 -fib 1 -iface em0
route add -host 203.0.113.1 -fib 1 198.51.100.254
.Ed
.Pp
And GRE tunnel should be configured to change FIB for encapsulated packets:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig greN create
ifconfig greN inet 198.51.100.1 203.0.113.1
ifconfig greN inet tunnel 198.51.100.1 203.0.113.1 tunnelfib 1
.Ed
.Sh NOTES
The MTU of
.Nm
interfaces is set to 1476 by default, to match the value used by Cisco routers.
This may not be an optimal value, depending on the link between the two tunnel
endpoints.
It can be adjusted via
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
For correct operation, the
.Nm
device needs a route to the decapsulating host that does not run over the tunnel,
as this would be a loop.
.Pp
The kernel must be set to forward datagrams by setting the
.Va net.inet.ip.forwarding
.Xr sysctl 8
variable to non-zero.

.Sh BUGS
The current implementation uses the key only for outgoing packets.
Incoming packets with a different key or without a key will be treated as if they
would belong to this interface.
.Pp
The sequence number field also used only for outgoing packets.
