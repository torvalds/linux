.Sh NAME
.Nm iwi
.Nd "Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG/2225BG/2915ABG IEEE 802.11 driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
include the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iwi"
.Cd "device iwifw"
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Cd "device firmware"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_iwi_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
In both cases, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5
to acknowledge the firmware license (see below):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
legal.intel_iwi.license_ack=1
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for
.Tn Intel
PRO/Wireless 2200BG/2915ABG MiniPCI and 2225BG PCI network adapters.
.Nm
supports
.Cm station ,
.Cm adhoc ,
and
.Cm monitor
mode operation.
Only one virtual interface may be configured at any time.
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
This driver requires the firmware built with the
.Nm iwifw
module to work.
For the loaded firmware to be enabled for use the license at
.Pa /usr/share/doc/legal/intel_iwi.LICENSE
must be agreed by adding the following line to
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Pp
.Dl "legal.intel_iwi.license_ack=1"
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /usr/share/doc/legal/intel_iwi.LICENSE" -compact

.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwi0 inet 192.168.0.20 \e
    netmask 0xffffff00
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwi0 ssid my_net up"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwi0 ssid my_net \e
	wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev iwi0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \e
    wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey 1
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "iwi%d: device timeout"
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
.It "iwi%d: firmware error"
The onboard microcontroller crashed for some reason.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
.It "iwi%d: timeout waiting for firmware initialization to complete"
The onboard microcontroller failed to initialize in time.
This should not happen.
.It "iwi%d: could not load firmware image '%s'"
The driver failed to load the firmware image using the
.Xr firmware 9
subsystem.
Verify the
.Xr iwifw 4
firmware module is installed and the license agreement
.Xr loader 8
tunable has been set.
.It "iwi%d: could not load boot firmware"
An attempt to upload the boot firmware image to the onboard microcontroller
failed.
This should not happen.
.It "iwi%d: could not load microcode"
An attempt to upload the microcode image to the onboard microcontroller failed.
This should not happen.
.It "iwi%d: could not load main firmware"
An attempt to upload the main firmware image to the onboard microcontroller
failed.
This should not happen.
