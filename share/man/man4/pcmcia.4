.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
subsystem provides machine-independent bus support and
drivers for PCMCIA (PC Card)
devices.
.Pp
.Ox
provides support for the following devices.
Note that not all architectures support all devices.
.Ss Serial interfaces and modems
.Bl -tag -width 12n -offset ind -compact
.It Xr com 4
serial communications interface
.El
.Ss Wired network interfaces
.Bl -tag -width 12n -offset ind -compact
.It Xr ep 4
3Com EtherLink III and Fast EtherLink III 10/100 Ethernet device
.It Xr ne 4
NE2000 and compatible 10/100 Ethernet device
.It Xr sm 4
SMC91C9x and SMC91C1xx-based 10/100 Ethernet device
.It Xr xe 4
Xircom-based 16-bit PCMCIA 10/100 Ethernet device
.El
.Ss Wireless network interfaces
.Bl -tag -width 12n -offset ind -compact
.It Xr an 4
Aironet Communications 4500/4800 IEEE 802.11FH/b wireless network device
.It Xr malo 4
Marvell Libertas IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network device
.It Xr wi 4
WaveLAN/IEEE, PRISM 2-3, and Spectrum24 IEEE 802.11b wireless network device
.El
.Ss SCSI controllers
.Bl -tag -width 12n -offset ind -compact
.It Xr aic 4
Adaptec AIC-6260 and AIC-6360 SCSI interface
.El
.Ss IDE controllers
.Bl -tag -width 12n -offset ind -compact
.It Xr wdc 4
WD100x compatible hard disk controller driver
.El
.Pp
The supported PCMCIA controllers are those that are i82365 compatible.
.Sh NOTES
On some
.Nm
adapters, for instance the
.Xr sbus 4 Ns -based
.Xr stp 4 ,
the
.Nm
bus will be mapped in big-endian format instead of the natural (and
preferred) little endian format.
Unfortunately such controllers lack the hardware facility to swap bytes,
and it is not efficient to convert all drivers to always know about this.
While 8 bit drivers can invisibly work on such a bus, 16 bit
drivers will need modification to handle this.
So far,
.Xr wi 4
is the only driver to require these modifications.
.Pp
If the
.Nm
adapter is not detected, or if
.Nm
events (such as card insertion) do not occur, there may be a
.Tn PCI
card BIOS mapped in the same memory space the
.Nm
driver is configured to use (this is often the case with Ethernet
card boot ROMs).
The output from
.Xr dmesg 8
should contain a line beginning with
.Dq bios0
that lists the memory address and size of mapped regions.
If there is a conflict, you can use
.Xr boot_config 8
to change the iomem parameter of the
.Em pcic
device to a non-overlapping address, such as 0xd8000 for
.Em pcic0 .
Some experimentation may be required to find a working value; in some
cases the size parameter of the
.Em pcic
device may need to be decreased to avoid a conflict.
