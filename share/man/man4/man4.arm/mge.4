.Sh NAME
.Nm mge
.Nd "Marvell Gigabit Ethernet device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device mge"
.Cd "device miibus"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for gigabit Ethernet controller integrated in Marvell
system-on-chip devices.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps operation
.It 1000baseT
Set 1000baseT operation
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Set full duplex operation
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports polled operation when the system is configured with
DEVICE_POLLING kernel option, see
.Xr polling 4
for more details.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports reception and transmission of extended frames
for
.Xr vlan 4 .
This capability of
.Nm
can be controlled by means of the
.Cm vlanmtu
parameter
to
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports interrupts coalescing (IC) so that raising a transmit/receive
frame interrupt is delayed, if possible, until a threshold-defined period of
time has elapsed.
The following sysctls regulate this behaviour (separately for each path):
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va dev.mge.X.int_coal.rx_time
.It Va dev.mge.X.int_coal.tx_time
.Pp
Value of 0 disables IC on the given path, value greater than zero corresponds
to a real time period and is expressed in units equivalent to 64 ticks of the
MGE clock.
Maximum allowed value depends on MGE hardware revision.
User provided values larger than supported will be trimmed to the maximum
supported.
More details are available in the reference manual of the device.
.El
.Sh HARDWARE
Gigabit Ethernet controllers built into the following Marvell systems-on-chip
are known to work with the
.Nm
driver:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Orion 88F5182
.It
Orion 88F5281
.It
Kirkwood 88F6281 (MGE V2)
.It
Discovery MV78100 (MGE V2)
.El
.Pp
There are also Marvell system controllers for PowerPC processors, which
include a variation of this gigabit Ethernet module integrated on chip, and
they should also work with the
.Nm
driver, but this wasn't tested:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
MV64430
.It
MV64460, MV64461, MV64462
.El

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 8.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The base version of
.Nm
device driver was written by
.An Grzegorz Bernacki.
It has been extended with advanced features (polling, interrupt coalescing,
multicast, h/w checksum calculation etc.) by
.An Piotr Ziecik .
