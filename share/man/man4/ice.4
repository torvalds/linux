.Nd Intel Ethernet 800 series PCI Express 1Gb/10Gb/25Gb/50Gb/100Gb Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ice* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports Intel 800 series controllers based on the
Intel E810 and E823 Ethernet chipsets, including the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
Intel E810-C SFP/QSFP

.Sh FILES
Intel 800 series controllers contain basic firmware which allows the
device to be used with single Tx/Rx queues and without any hardware
offloading features enabled.
For full functionality, the device needs the following firmware file,
which is loaded by the driver when the system boots:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/ice-ddp
.El
.Pp
This firmware file is not free because Intel refuses to grant
distribution rights without contractual obligations.
As a result, even though
.Ox
includes the driver, the firmware file cannot be included and
users have to download the file on their own.
.Pp
A prepackaged version of the firmware can be installed using
.Xr fw_update 8 .
