.Sh NAME
.Nm vnd
.Nd vnode disk driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device vnd" Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides a disk-like interface to a file.
This is useful for a variety of applications, such as building miniroot or
floppy disk images.
.Pp
This document assumes familiarity with how to generate kernels and
how to properly configure disks and pseudo-devices in a kernel
configuration file.
.Pp
In order to compile in support for
.Nm vnd
devices, a line similar to the following must be present in the kernel
configuration file:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
pseudo-device	vnd	4	# vnode disk driver
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ar count
argument is how many
.Nm vnds
memory is allocated for at boot time.
In this example, no more than 4
.Nm vnds
may be configured.
.Pp
There is a run-time utility that is used for configuring
.Nm vnds .
See
.Xr vnconfig 8
for more information.
.Sh IOCTL INTERFACE
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls are defined in
.In dev/vndioctl.h :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dv VNDIOCSET Fa "struct vnd_ioctl *"
Associate the file
.Va vnd_file
with a
.Nm
pseudo device, optionally encrypted using the Blowfish cipher and the key
specified in
.Va vnd_key
of length
.Va vnd_keylen .
The size of the configured device is returned in
.Va vnd_size .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct vnd_ioctl {
	char	*vnd_file;
	off_t	vnd_size;
	u_char	*vnd_key;
	int	vnd_keylen;
};
.Ed
.It Dv VNDIOCCLR Fa "struct vnd_ioctl *"
Disassociate a
.Nm
device.
.It Dv VNDIOCGET Fa "struct vnd_user *"
Get the associated file name, device, inode number, and unit number of a
.Nm
device.
If
.Va vnu_unit
is \-1, information on the
.Nm
device corresponding to the file descriptor passed to
.Xr ioctl 2
will be returned.
Otherwise,
.Va vnu_unit
may contain the unit number of another
.Nm
device.
This allows for opening just
.Li vnd0
and querying all available devices.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct vnd_user {
	char	vnufile[VNDNLEN];
	int	vnu_unit;
	dev_t	vnu_dev;
	ino_t	vnu_ino;
};
.Ed
.El
.Pp
Additionally, some
.Xr disklabel 8
related
.Xr ioctl 2
calls defined in
.In sys/dkio.h
are available:
.Dv DIOCGDINFO ,
.Dv DIOCSDINFO ,
and
.Dv DIOCWDINFO .
They are documented in
.Xr sd 4 .
