.Cd "myx* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the Myricom Myri-10G PCI Express 10Gb Ethernet
adapters based on the Myricom Lanai-Z8E and Lanai-Z8ES chipsets,
including the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
Myricom 10G-PCIE-8A-C Adapter (10GbaseCX4)
.It
Myricom 10G-PCIE-8A-R Adapter (10GbaseSR/LR)
.It
Myricom 10G-PCIE-8A-Q Adapter (10G XAUI)
.It

.El
.Pp
Low profile versions are supported as well.
.Sh FILES
The adapter needs a firmware file, which is selected and loaded on
demand by the driver when the device is attached:

driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Reyk Floeter Aq Mt reyk@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
While the firmware supports reading module information for
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Cm transceiver
to use, it does not support writing to the module.
This prevents configuration of the module, which may prevent
.Xr ifconfig 8
from reading the right data from the module where other network
cards succeed.
