.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 7.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
Intel Corporation and ported to
.Ox
by
.An NAITO Yuichiro .
.Sh BUGS
The VF relies on
.Dq vlan-filter
to receive VLAN-tagged packets.
Because the current driver doesn't have a way to configure it,
any VLAN-tagged packets will not be passed.
Alternatively,
on the host running the primary function,
there might be a way to configure a VLAN ID.
