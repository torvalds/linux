.Sh NAME
.Nm spif
.Nd SBus (spiffy) Serial/Parallel Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "spif* at sbus?"
.Cd "stty* at spif?"
.Cd "sbpp* at spif?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Sun Serial/Parallel Interface card
(Sun part number 501-1931)
based around the
Cirrus Logic CD180 octal serial controller
and the
Cirrus Logic PPC2 parallel port controller.
.Pp
The device minor numbers for this driver are encoded as follows:
.Bd -literal

      |   |   |   |   |   +---+---+---> port number
      |   |   |   |   |
      |   |   |   |   +---------------> unused

      +---+---------------------------> card number
.Ed
.Pp
Up to four cards are supported in the system.
.Pp
Each of the serial ports has an 8 byte FIFO for receive and transmit as
well as automatic hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "spif0: ccr timeout"
A timeout occurred while writing to one of the CD180 registers.
.It "stty0-N: ring overflow"
Incoming characters were discarded because the application
in control of the device did not read the input fast enough.
