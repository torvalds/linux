.Sh NAME
.Nm ebus
.Nd introduction to SPARC EBus bus support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ebus* at pci?"
.Cd "ebus* at mainbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
bus is designed to provide the ability to put ISA and traditional
Intel-style peripherals in a SPARC based system with a minimal amount
of glue logic.
Typically, it is implemented in the PCIO IC from SME, which also
implements an
.Xr hme 4
compatible PCI network device
.Pf ( Ql network ) .
The
.Nm
has four DMA channels, similar to the DMA seen in the
.Xr esp 4
SCSI DMA.
