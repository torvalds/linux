.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pflog
.Nd packet filter logging interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device pflog"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm pflog
interface is a pseudo-device which makes visible all packets logged by
the packet filter,
.Xr pf 4 .
Logged packets can easily be monitored in real
time by invoking
.Xr tcpdump 8
on the
.Nm
interface, or stored to disk using
.Xr pflogd 8 .
.Pp
The pflog0 interface is created automatically at boot if both
.Xr pf 4
and
.Xr pflogd 8
are enabled;
further instances can be created using
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
Each packet retrieved on this interface has a header associated
with it of length
.Dv PFLOG_HDRLEN .
This header documents the address family, interface name, rule
number, reason, action, and direction of the packet that was logged.
This structure, defined in
.In net/if_pflog.h
looks like
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct pfloghdr {
	u_int8_t	length;
	sa_family_t	af;
	u_int8_t	action;
	u_int8_t	reason;
	char		ifname[IFNAMSIZ];
	char		ruleset[PFLOG_RULESET_NAME_SIZE];
	u_int32_t	rulenr;
	u_int32_t	subrulenr;
	uid_t		uid;
	pid_t		pid;
	uid_t		rule_uid;
	pid_t		rule_pid;
	u_int8_t	dir;
	u_int8_t	rewritten;
	sa_family_t	naf;
	u_int8_t	pad[1];
	struct pf_addr	saddr;
	struct pf_addr	daddr;
	u_int16_t	sport;
	u_int16_t	dport;
};
.Ed
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a
.Nm
interface
and monitor all packets logged on it:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig pflog1 up
# tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog1

device first appeared in
