.Sh NAME
.Nm malo
.Nd "Marvell Libertas IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device malo"
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Cd "device firmware"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_malo_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Marvell Libertas 88W8335 based PCI
and Cardbus network adapters.
.Nm
supports
.Cm station
and
.Cm monitor
mode operation.
Only one virtual interface may be configured at any time.
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
This driver requires firmware to be loaded before it will work.
The
.Pa ports/net/malo-firmware-kmod
port needs to be installed before
.Xr ifconfig 8
will work.
.Sh HARDWARE
The following cards are among those supported by the
.Nm
driver:
.Bl -column "Netgear WG311v3" "88W8335" "PCI" "b/g"
.Em "Card" Ta Em "Chip" Ta Em "Bus" Ta Em "Standard"
.It "Netgear WG311v3" Ta "88W8335" Ta "PCI" Ta "b/g"
.It "Tenda TWL542P" Ta "88W8335" Ta "PCI" Ta "b/g"
.It "U-Khan UW-2054i" Ta "88W8335" Ta "PCI" Ta "b/g"
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev malo0 inet 192.168.0.20 \e
    netmask 0xffffff00
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig wlan create wlandev malo0 ssid my_net up"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev malo0 ssid my_net \e
	wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up
