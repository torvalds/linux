.Sh DESCRIPTION
The hal provides hardware support for wireless network adapters based on
the Atheros AR5210, AR5211, AR5212, AR5213, AR2413, AR2417, AR2425,
AR5413, AR5416, AR5418, AR5424, AR9130, AR9160, AR9220, AR9280, AR9285,
AR9287, AR9380, AR9390, AR9580, AR9590, AR9562 and QCA9565
chips (and companion RF/baseband parts).
This code is part of the
.Xr ath 4
driver but configured separately to allow fine-grained control
over the set of chips supported.
Selecting
.Nm
enables support for all PCI and Cardbus devices.
.Pp
Some devices come in Cardbus/MiniPCI/PCI format.
Others (for example AR2413, AR2427, AR5418, AR9280, AR9285, AR9287) come in
PCIe, Mini-PCIe or ExpressCard format.
.Pp
Historically this code has been released in a binary-only form
and packaged as a separate module.
With the release of source code for the hal this is no longer true
and the code is tightly integrated with the driver.
.Sh HARDWARE
The following cards are among those supported by the
.Nm
module:
