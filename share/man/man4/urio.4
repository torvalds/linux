.Sh NAME
.Nm urio
.Nd "USB driver for the Rio MP3 players"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device urio"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
urio_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Rio MP3 players from Diamond MultiMedia
which attaches to the USB port.
The
.Nm
device must be configured in the kernel, along with
.Em usb
and one of the
.Em uhci
or
.Em ohci
controllers.
.Pp
Subsequently, the
.Pa /dev/urio0
device can be used by the Rio userland applications.
.Sh HARDWARE
The following devices are supported by the
.Nm
driver:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Diamond MultiMedia Rio 500
.It
Diamond MultiMedia Rio 600
.It
Diamond MultiMedia Rio 800
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/ums0 -compact
.It Pa /dev/urio0
blocking device node
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following line in the kernel configuration file adds the
.Nm
driver to the kernel:
.Dl device urio
.Pp
To download a song over the
.Tn USB
connection into the Rio using the
.Xr rio_add_song 1
utility (see the
.Sx SEE ALSO
section):
.Dl rio_add_song /usr/local/MP3/TracyChapman/02-Fast-Car.mp3

.Pp
The Rio500 tools from SourceForge
are the actual userland tools used to download,
format or rename songs on players.
When compiling these tools,
the following pre-build configuration command will ensure that
.Pa rio_usb.h
is available in the include path
and that the device used is
.Pa /dev/urio0 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/dev/usb" ./configure \\
    --with-devicepath='/dev' --with-deviceentry='urio0'
