.Sh NAME
.Nm run
.Nd Ralink Technology/MediaTek USB IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "run* at uhub? port ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports USB 2.0 wireless adapters based on the Ralink RT2700U,
RT2800U, RT3000U and RT3900E chipsets.
.Pp
The RT2700U chipset consists of two integrated chips, an RT2770 MAC/BBP and
an RT2720 (1T2R) or RT2750 (dual-band 1T2R) radio transceiver.
.Pp
The RT2800U chipset consists of two integrated chips, an RT2870 MAC/BBP and
an RT2820 (2T3R) or RT2850 (dual-band 2T3R) radio transceiver.
.Pp
The RT3000U is a single-chip solution based on an RT3070 MAC/BBP and
an RT3020 (1T1R), RT3021 (1T2R), RT3022 (2T2R) or RT3052 (dual-band 2T2R)
radio transceiver.
.Pp
The RT3900E is a single-chip solution based on an RT3593, RT5390,
RT5392 or an RT5592 MAC/BBP and an RT3053 (dual-band 3T3R),
RT5370 (1T1R), RT5372 (2T2R), or RT5572 (dual-band 2T2R)
radio transceiver.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA1 and WPA2).
WPA2 is currently the most secure encryption standard for wireless networks
supported by
.Ox .
It is strongly recommended that neither WEP nor WPA1
are used as the sole mechanism to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses.
WPA1 is disabled by default and may be enabled using the option
.Qq Cm wpaprotos Ar wpa1,wpa2 .
For standard WPA networks which use pre-shared keys (PSK),
keys are configured using the
.Qq Cm wpakey
option.
WPA-Enterprise networks require use of the wpa_supplicant package.
The
.Nm
driver offloads both encryption and decryption of data frames to the
hardware for the WEP40, WEP104, TKIP(+MIC) and CCMP ciphers.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The driver needs the following firmware files,
which are loaded when an interface is brought up:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It /etc/firmware/run-rt2870
.It /etc/firmware/run-rt3071

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "run0: error N, could not read firmware ..."
For some reason, the driver was unable to read the microcode file from the
filesystem.
The file might be missing or corrupted.
.It "run0: could not load 8051 microcode"
An error occurred while attempting to upload the microcode to the onboard 8051
microcontroller unit.
.It "run0: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
