.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports IPv4 receive IP/TCP/UDP checksum offload and transmit IP/TCP
checksum offload, VLAN tag insertion and stripping,
as well as a 256-bit multicast hash filter.
The BCM5717, BCM5718, BCM5723, BCM5754, BCM5755, BCM5761, BCM5764, BCM5784,
BCM5785, BCM5787 and BCM577xx chips also support IPv6 receive TCP/UDP
checksum offload.
.Pp
The BCM5700, BCM5701, BCM5703, BCM5704, BCM5714, BCM5717, BCM5719, BCM5720,
BCM5762, BCM5780, BCM57765 and BCM57766
chips are capable of supporting jumbo frames.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width 1000baseSX
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It Cm 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseT
Set 1000baseT operation over twisted pair.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-duplex
modes are supported.
.It Cm 1000baseSX
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-duplex
modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
