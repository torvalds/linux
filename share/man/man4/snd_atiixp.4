.Sh NAME
.Nm snd_atiixp
.Nd "ATI IXP bridge device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device sound"
.Cd "device snd_atiixp"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
snd_atiixp_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
bridge driver allows the generic audio driver,
.Xr sound 4 ,
to attach to ATI IXP audio devices.
This driver supports 16bit playback and recording, and 32bit native playback
and recording.
.Ss Runtime Configuration
The following
.Xr sysctl 8
variables are available in addition to those available to all
.Xr sound 4
devices:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va dev.pcm.%d.polling" -offset indent
.It Va dev.pcm.%d.polling
Experimental polling mode, where the driver operates by querying the device
state on each tick using
.Xr callout 9 .
Polling is disabled by default.
Do not enable it unless you are facing weird interrupt problems or if the
device cannot generate interrupts at all.
.El
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following audio chipsets:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
ATI IXP 200
.It
ATI IXP 300
.It
ATI IXP 400
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sound 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 6.1 .

.An Joel Dahl Aq Mt joel@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver
does not support S/PDIF, but implementing it should be fairly easy if the
right hardware is available.
.Pp
32bit native recording is broken on some hardware.
