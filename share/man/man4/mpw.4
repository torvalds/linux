.Sh NAME
.Nm mpw
.Nd MPLS Ethernet pseudowire
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device mpw"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface is used to create an MPLS Ethernet layer 2 tunnel between
two points.
.Pp
An
.Nm
interface can be created at runtime using the
.Sy ifconfig Nm Ns Ar N Cm create
command or by setting up a
.Xr hostname.if 5
configuration file for
.Xr netstart 8 .
The interface itself can be configured with
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
The local MPLS label, the remote MPLS label and neighbor, use of
pseudowire control words, or flow-aware transport are normally
configured after negotiation with a remote system using
.Xr ldpd 8 ,
but it is also possible to configure them manually using
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a pseudowire with local label 20 and remote label 21 on
neighbor 10.254.0.1:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig mpw5 create
# ifconfig mpw5 mplslabel 20 pweneighbor 21 10.254.0.1
# ifconfig mpw5 up
.Ed
.Pp
Enable the use of the Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3)
Control Word, and disable the use of a Flow label for Flow-Aware
Transport of Pseudowires:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig mpw5 pwecw -pwefat
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm mpw
interfaces may be used to build a Virtual Private LAN Service
(VPLS) with
.Xr bridge 4 .
A VPLS is constructed with a full mesh of MPLS pseudowire tunnels
between all peers, but this introduces loops in the topology.
To prevent broadcast packets received from the VPLS being forwarded
to its peers, all the pseudowire interfaces can be configured to
enforce the split-horizon forwarding rule by adding them to the
same protected bridge domain.
Different VPLS meshes can be joined together on the same bridge
using different identifiers for their protected domains:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig mpw10 create up
# ifconfig mpw11 create up
# ifconfig mpw12 create up
# ifconfig bridge0 create
# ifconfig bridge0 add em2
# ifconfig bridge0 add mpw10 add mpw11 add mpw12
# ifconfig bridge0 protected mpw10 1
# ifconfig bridge0 protected mpw11 1
# ifconfig bridge0 protected mpw12 1
