.Sh NAME
.Nm xen
.Nd Xen domU nexus device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "xen0 at pvbus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
driver performs HVM domU guest initialization, provides abstraction for
virtual Xen interrupts, access to the XenStore configuration storage as
well as a device probing facility for paravirtualized devices such as
disk and network interfaces.
.Pp
When running under XenServer, to let the host know that the guest has
finished initializing and to allow graceful shutdown, set the following
XenStore properties with
.Xr hostctl 8
in
.Xr rc.local 8 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ostype=$(sysctl -n kern.ostype)
osrelease=$(sysctl -n kern.osrelease)
