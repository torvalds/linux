.Sh NAME
.Nm lo
.Nd software loopback network interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device loop"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm loop
interface is a software loopback mechanism which may be
used for performance analysis, software testing, and/or local
communication.
.Pp
A
.Nm loop
interface can be created at runtime using the
.Ic ifconfig lo Ns Ar N Ic create
command or by setting up a
.Xr hostname.if 5
configuration file for
.Xr netstart 8 .
The
.Nm lo0
interface will always exist and cannot be destroyed using
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
As with other network interfaces, the loopback interface must have
network addresses assigned for each address family with which it is to be used.
These addresses
may be set or changed with the
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It lo0: can't handle afX.
The interface was handed
a message with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address
family; the packet was dropped.
