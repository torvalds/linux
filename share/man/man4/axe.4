.Pp
The AX88172, AX88178, and AX88772 are USB 2.0 devices designed to work with
either Ethernet or HomePNA transceivers.
The AX88172 and AX88772 contain 10/100 Ethernet MACs with MII interfaces.
The AX88178 contains a 10/100/1Gb Ethernet MAC with a GMII/MII
interface.
All adapters will operate with either USB 1.x or USB 2.0 controllers, however
performance with 1.x controllers will be limited since the USB 1.x standard
specifies a maximum transfer speed of 12Mbps.
Users with USB 1.x controllers should therefore not expect to actually
achieve 100Mbps speeds with these devices.
.Pp
A 64-bit multicast hash table is supported,
single perfect filter entry for the station address,
all-multicast mode, and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width "autoselect"
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options (this is the default).
The user can manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
.It 1000baseT
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation (AX88178 only).
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width "full-duplex"
.It full-duplex
Force full-duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half-duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
The interface will operate in
half-duplex mode if no media option is specified.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "axe0: watchdog timeout"
A packet was queued for transmission and a transmit command was
issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the transmission
before a timeout expired.
.It "axe0: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
