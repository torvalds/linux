.Sh NAME
.Nm ipwfw
.Nd "Firmware Module for Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this module into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ipwfw"
.Ed
.Pp
This will include three firmware images inside the kernel.
If you want to pick only the firmware image for the mode you want to operate
your network adapter in choose one of the following:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ipwbssfw"
.Cd "device ipwibssfw"
.Cd "device ipwmonitorfw"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ipw_bss_load="YES"
ipw_ibss_load="YES"
ipw_monitor_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This module provides access to firmware sets for the
Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 series of IEEE 802.11 adapters.
It may be statically linked into the kernel, or loaded as a module.
.Pp
For the loaded firmware to be enabled for use the license at
.Pa /usr/share/doc/legal/intel_ipw.LICENSE
must be agreed to by adding the following line to
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Pp
.Dl "legal.intel_ipw.license_ack=1"
