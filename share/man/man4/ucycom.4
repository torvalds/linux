.Sh NAME
.Nm ucycom
.Nd device driver for Cypress CY7C63743 and CY7C64013 USB to RS232 bridges
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device ucom"
.Cd "device ucycom"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ucycom_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Cypress CY7C63743 and CY7C64013 bridge
chips.
These chips were designed to provide a low-cost transition path to USB
for existing RS232 devices, and have fairly limited capabilities.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver behaves like a
.Xr tty 4 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver currently supports the following devices which incorporate
Cypress USB to RS232 bridge chips:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
DeLorme Earthmate USB GPS receiver
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/dev/ttyU*.init" -compact
.It Pa /dev/ttyU*
for callin ports
.It Pa /dev/ttyU*.init
.It Pa /dev/ttyU*.lock
corresponding callin initial-state and lock-state devices
.Pp
.It Pa /dev/cuaU*
for callout ports
.It Pa /dev/cuaU*.init
.It Pa /dev/cuaU*.lock
corresponding callout initial-state and lock-state devices
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tty 4 ,
.Xr ucom 4 ,
.Xr usb 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 5.3 .
