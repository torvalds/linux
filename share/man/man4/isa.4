.Sh NAME
.Nm isa , isadma
.Nd introduction to ISA bus support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "# amd64 and i386"
.Cd "isa* at amdpcib?"
.Cd "isa0 at tcpcib?"
.Cd "isa0 at mainbus0"
.Cd "isa0 at pcib?"
.Cd "isadma0 at isa?"
.Pp
.Cd "# i386"
.Cd "isa0 at ichpcib?"
.Cd "isa* at glxpcib?"
.Cd "isa0 at gscpcib?"
.Pp
.Cd "# alpha"
.Cd "isa* at pceb?"
.Cd "isa* at sio?"
.Cd "isadma0 at isa?"
.Pp
.Cd "# loongson"
.Cd "isa* at glxpcib?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The system includes a machine-independent ISA bus subsystem
and several machine-independent ISA device drivers.
.Pp
Attachments are machine-dependent and depend on the bus topology and
ISA bus interface of the system.
Drivers able to use DMA attach at
.Nm isadma ;
otherwise they attach at
.Nm isa .
.Pp
Note that interrupt mappings on the i386 may require that the BIOS
be configured to reserve the interrupts for these devices as "Legacy ISA".
If such configuration is not done, the system may use those interrupts
for
.Xr pci 4
or
.Xr isapnp 4
devices instead.
.Pp
.Ox
