.Dt BONITO 4 loongson
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bonito
.Nd memory and PCI or PCI-X controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bonito0 at mainbus0"
.Cd "pci0 at bonito?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports both the Algorithmics Bonito64 memory and PCI controller
on Loongson 2E-based systems, or the onboard memory and PCI-X controller
found on Loongson 2F-based systems, which is a very close design, albeit
not compatible with the original Bonito.
.Pp
Differences between the two models of controllers are hidden at the
.Nm
driver level.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also handles PCI interrupt routing; on systems featuring a
.Xr glxpcib 4
PCI-ISA bridge to which legacy devices are connected, it will also
handle legacy interrupts.
