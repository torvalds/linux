.Sh NAME
.Nm gdiumiic
.Nd Gdium specific GPIO I2C controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gdiumiic0 at gpio0 offset 6 mask 0x81"
.Cd "gdiumiic0 at gpio0 offset 46 mask 0x03"
.Cd "iic0 at gdiumiic0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver allows bit-banging an I2C bus as a master using two GPIO pins.
The first pin is used as a serial clock (SCL) signal and the second as
a serial data (SDA).
Both GPIO pins must be able to drive an output and the SDA pin must be
also able to read an input.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver is derived from the
.Nm gpioiic
driver, using a different pin ordering, and knowledge of the Gdium I2C bus
configuration.
