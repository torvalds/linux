.Sh NAME
.Nm isl
.Nd Intersil(TM) I2C ISL29018 sensor driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines into
the kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device isl"
.Cd "device ig4"
.Cd "device iicbus"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
isl_load="YES"
ig4_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
On many Chromebook models this driver can be automatically configured with the
help of the
.Xr chromebook_platform 4
driver.
Alternatively, the
.Nm
driver can be manually configured in
.Pa /boot/device.hints :
.Cd hint.isl.0.at="iicbus0"
.Cd hint.isl.0.addr="0x88"
.Cd hint.isl.1.at="iicbus1"
.Cd hint.isl.1.addr="0x88"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to sensor data provided by the Intersil(TM) I2C
ISL29018 Digital Ambient Light Sensor and Proximity Sensor with Interrupt
Function.
Functionality is basic and provided through the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.
.Pp
On a system using
.Xr device.hints 5 ,
these values are configurable for
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width "hint.isl.%d.addr"
.It Va hint.isl.%d.at
target
.Xr iicbus 4 .
.It Va hint.isl.%d.addr
.Nm
i2c address on the
.Xr iicbus 4 .
.El
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following
.Xr sysctl 8
variables are available:
.Bl -tag -width "dev.isl.X.resolution"
.It Va dev.isl.X.als
Current ALS (Ambient Light Sensor) readout.
.It Va dev.isl.X.ir
Current IR (InfraRed) sensor readout.
.It Va dev.isl.X.prox
Current proximity sensor readout.
.It Va dev.isl.X.resolution
Current sensor resolution.
.It Va dev.isl.X.range
Current sensor range.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss Ambient light sensor read out
.Bd -literal
$ sysctl dev.isl.0.als
dev.isl.0.als: 64
.Ed
.Ss Automatically adjust brightness
This requires the port
.Pa graphics/intel-backlight
and only works with laptops using a supported Intel(R) GPU.
.Bd -literal
$ pkg install intel-backlight
$ sh /usr/local/share/examples/intel-backlight/isl_backlight.sh

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver detects the device based from the I2C address.
This might have unforeseen consequences if the initialization sequence
is sent to an unknown device at that address.
