.Sh NAME
.Nm snd_ich
.Nd "Intel ICH AC'97 and compatible bridge device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device sound"
.Cd "device snd_ich"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
snd_ich_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
bridge driver allows the generic audio driver
.Xr sound 4
to attach to Intel ICH AC'97 and compatible audio devices.
.Pp
Some later chips, like ICH6/ICH7, depending on wiring can instead implement
newer Intel HD Audio specification, which is supported by
.Xr snd_hda 4
driver.
