.Sh NAME
.Nm cd
.Nd SCSI CD-ROM driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device cd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for a
.Tn SCSI
.Tn CD-ROM
(Compact Disc-Read Only Memory) drive.
In an attempt to look like a regular disk, the
.Nm
driver synthesizes a partition table, with one partition covering the entire
.Tn CD-ROM .
It is possible to modify this partition table using
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
but it will only last until the
.Tn CD-ROM
is unmounted.
In general the interfaces are similar to those described by
.Xr ada 4
and
.Xr da 4 .
.Pp
As the
.Tn SCSI
adapter is probed during boot, the
.Tn SCSI
bus is scanned for devices.
Any devices found which answer as CDROM
(type 5) or WORM (type 4) type devices will be `attached' to the
.Nm
driver.
Prior to
.Fx 2.1 ,
the first device found will be attached as
.Li cd0
the next,
.Li cd1 ,
etc.
Beginning in
.Fx 2.1
it is possible to specify what cd unit a device should
come on line as; refer to
.Xr scsi 4
for details on kernel configuration.
.Pp
The system utility
.Xr disklabel 8
may be used to read the synthesized
disk label
structure, which will contain correct figures for the size of the
.Tn CD-ROM
should that information be required.
.Sh KERNEL CONFIGURATION
Any number of
.Tn CD-ROM
devices may be attached to the system regardless of system
configuration as all resources are dynamically allocated.
.Sh IOCTLS
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls which apply to
.Tn SCSI
.Tn CD-ROM
drives are defined
in the header files
.In sys/cdio.h
and
.In sys/disklabel.h .
.Bl -tag -width CDIOCREADSUBCHANNEL
.It Dv CDIOCPLAYTRACKS
.Pq Li "struct ioc_play_track"

	u_char data_format;
#define CD_SUBQ_DATA		0

	struct  cd_sub_channel_info *data;
};
.Ed
.It Dv CDIOREADTOCHEADER
.Pq Li "struct ioc_toc_header"
Return summary information about the table of contents for the mounted
.Tn CD-ROM .
The information is returned into the following structure:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct ioc_toc_header {
	u_short len;
	u_char  starting_track;
	u_char  ending_track;
};
.Ed
.It Dv CDIOREADTOCENTRYS
.Pq Li "struct ioc_read_toc_entry"

.Pq Yes, this command name is misspelled.
The argument structure is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct ioc_read_toc_entry {
	u_char	address_format;
	u_char	starting_track;
	u_short	data_len;
	struct  cd_toc_entry *data;
};
.Ed

.Li data_len
and pointed to by
.Li data .
.It Dv CDIOCSETPATCH
.Pq Li "struct ioc_patch"
Attach various audio channels to various output channels.
The argument structure is defined thusly:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct ioc_patch {
	u_char	patch[4];
	/* one for each channel */
};
.Ed

	/* one for each channel */
};
.Ed

.Tn CD-ROM
disc.
Not all drives support this feature.
.It Dv CDIOCEJECT
Eject the
.Tn CD-ROM .
.It Dv CDIOCCLOSE
Tell the drive to close its door and load the media.
Not all drives support this feature.
.El
.Sh NOTES
When a
.Tn CD-ROM
is changed in a drive controlled by the
.Nm
driver, then the act of changing the media will invalidate the
disklabel and information held within the kernel.
To stop corruption,
all accesses to the device will be discarded until there are no more
open file descriptors referencing the device.
During this period, all
new open attempts will be rejected.
When no more open file descriptors
reference the device, the first next open will load a new set of
parameters (including disklabel) for the drive.
.Pp
The audio code in the
.Nm
driver only support
.Tn SCSI-2
standard audio commands.
As many
.Tn CD-ROM
manufacturers have not followed the standard, there are many
.Tn CD-ROM
drives for which audio will not work.
Some work is planned to support
some of the more common `broken'
.Tn CD-ROM
drives; however, this is not yet under way.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variables are available as both
.Xr sysctl 8
variables and
.Xr loader 8
tunables:
.Bl -tag -width 12
.It kern.cam.cd.retry_count
.Pp
This variable determines how many times the
.Nm
driver will retry a READ or WRITE command.
This does not affect the number of retries used during probe time or for
the
.Nm
driver dump routine.
This value currently defaults to 4.
.It kern.cam.cd.%d.minimum_cmd_size
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver attempts to automatically determine whether the drive it is talking
to supports 6 byte or 10 byte MODE SENSE/MODE SELECT operations.
Many
.Tn SCSI
drives only support 6 byte commands, and
.Tn ATAPI
drives only support 10 byte commands.
The
.Nm
driver first attempts to determine whether the protocol in use typically
supports 6 byte commands by issuing a CAM Path Inquiry CCB.
It will then default to 6 byte or 10 byte commands as appropriate.
After that, the
.Nm
driver defaults to using 6 byte commands (assuming the protocol the drive
speaks claims to support 6 byte commands), until one fails with a
.Tn SCSI
ILLEGAL REQUEST error.
Then it tries the 10 byte version of the command to
see if that works instead.
Users can change the default via per-drive
sysctl variables and loader tunables.
Where
.Dq %d
is the unit number of the drive in question.
Valid minimum command sizes
are 6 and 10.
Any value above 6 will be rounded to 10, and any value below
6 will be rounded to 6.

.Sh HISTORY
This
.Nm
driver is based upon the
.Nm
driver written by Julian Elischer, which appeared in
.Bx 386 0.1 .
The
CAM version of the
.Nm
driver was written by Kenneth Merry and first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The names of the structures used for the third argument to
.Fn ioctl
were poorly chosen, and a number of spelling errors have survived in
the names of the
.Fn ioctl
commands.
