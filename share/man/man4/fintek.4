.Sh NAME
.Nm fintek
.Nd Fintek F75375 temperature sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "fintek* at iic? flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Fintek F75375 temperature sensor
and fan controller.
The sensor possesses a collection of sensor values which are
made available through the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ sysctl hw.sensors.fintek0
hw.sensors.fintek0.temp0=31.00 degC
hw.sensors.fintek0.temp1=29.00 degC
hw.sensors.fintek0.fan0=0 RPM
hw.sensors.fintek0.fan1=0 RPM
hw.sensors.fintek0.volt0=1.72 V DC (VCC)
hw.sensors.fintek0.volt1=1.34 V DC
hw.sensors.fintek0.volt2=1.73 V DC
hw.sensors.fintek0.volt3=0.90 V DC
.Ed
.Pp
On some machines the fans will not function properly with the chip in
default mode.
Setting
.Cm flags
to 0x0001 will make the fans run at full speed to prevent overheating.
