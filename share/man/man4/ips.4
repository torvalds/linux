.Pp
.Bl -bullet -width Ds -offset indent -compact

ServeRAID 3H/3HB/3L
.It

Although the controllers are actual RAID controllers,
the driver makes them look just like SCSI controllers.
All RAID configuration is done through the bootable
IBM ServeRAID Support CD;
a CD image is freely available at the IBM website.
.Pp
RAID management is done through the
.Xr bio 4
device with the
.Xr bioctl 8
command.
Logical disk status is exposed under the
.Va hw.sensors
.Xr sysctl 8
and can be monitored using
.Xr sensorsd 8 .
