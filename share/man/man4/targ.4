.Sh NAME
.Nm targ
.Nd SCSI target emulator driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device targ"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides an interface for usermode programs to emulate SCSI target
devices.
A sample program that emulates a disk drive (similar to
.Xr da 4 )
can be found in
.Pa /usr/share/examples/scsi_target .
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supplies the control device
.Pa /dev/targ .
After opening the device, the file descriptor must be bound to a
specific bus/target/LUN and enabled to process CCBs using the
.Dv TARGIOCENABLE
ioctl.
The process then uses
.Xr write 2
to send CCBs to the SIM and
.Xr poll 2
or
.Xr kqueue 2
to see if responses are ready.
Pointers to completed CCBs are returned via
.Xr read 2 .
Any data transfers requested by the user CCBs are done via zero-copy IO.
.Sh IOCTLS
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls are defined in the header file
.In cam/scsi/scsi_targetio.h .
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv TARGIOCDISABLE"
.It Dv TARGIOCENABLE
.Pq Vt "struct ioc_enable_lun"
Enable target mode on the LUN specified by the following structure:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct ioc_enable_lun {
	path_id_t	path_id;
	target_id_t	target_id;
	lun_id_t	lun_id;
	int		grp6_len;
	int		grp7_len;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The selected path (bus), target, and LUN must not already be in use or
.Er EADDRINUSE
is returned.
If
.Va grp6_len
or
.Va grp7_len
are non-zero, reception of vendor-specific commands
is enabled.
.It Dv TARGIOCDISABLE
Disable target mode and abort all pending CCBs.
The CCBs may optionally be read as they complete.
.Dv TARGIOCENABLE
can then be called to activate a different LUN.
Multiple disable calls have no effect.
The
.Xr close 2
system call automatically disables target mode if enabled.
.It Dv TARGIOCDEBUG
.Pq Vt int
Enables
.Dv CAM_PERIPH
debugging if the argument is non-zero, otherwise disables
it.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /sys/cam/scsi/scsi_target.c" -compact
.It In cam/scsi/scsi_targetio.h
describes the usermode interface.
.It Pa /sys/cam/scsi/scsi_target.c
is the driver source file.
.It Pa /dev/targ
is the control device.

.Re
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 3.0
and was written by
.An Justin T. Gibbs .
It was rewritten
for
.Fx 5.0
by
.An Nate Lawson Aq Mt nate@root.org .
.Sh BUGS
Currently, only the
.Xr ahc 4
and
.Xr isp 4
drivers fully support target mode.
.Pp
The
.Xr ahc 4
driver does not support tagged queuing in target mode.
