.Dt IPMI 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ipmi
.Nd "OpenIPMI compatible IPMI interface driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device ipmi"
.Pp
To manually specify I/O attachment in
.Pa /boot/device.hints :
.Cd hint.ipmi.0.at="isa"
.Cd hint.ipmi.0.port="0xCA2"
.Cd hint.ipmi.0.spacing="8"
.Cd hint.ipmi.0.mode="KCS"
.Pp
To manually specify memory attachment in
.Pa /boot/device.hints :
.Cd hint.ipmi.0.at="isa"
.Cd hint.ipmi.0.maddr="0xf0000000"
.Cd hint.ipmi.0.spacing="8"
.Cd hint.ipmi.0.mode="SMIC"
.Pp
Meaning of
.Ar spacing :
.Bl -tag -offset indent -compact -width 0x0
.It 8
8 bit alignment
.It 16
16 bit alignment
.It 32
32 bit alignment
.El
.Pp
If the
.Ar port
and
.Ar spacing
are not specified the interface type default will be used.
Only specify either the
.Ar port
for I/O access or
.Ar maddr
for memory access.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn IPMI
(Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is a standard for
monitoring system hardware by permitting generic code to detect
and monitor the sensors in a system.
The
.Tn IPMI
standard offers watchdog support, an FRU database, and other
support extensions.
It is currently being adopted by the makers of many
single board and embedded system manufacturers.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver in
.Fx
is heavily adopted from the standard and
.Tn Linux
driver; however, not all features described in the
standard are supported.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver implements the power cycling option to
.Xr shutdown 8
to implement power cycling of the system.
The motherboard's BMC must support the chassis device and the optional
power cycle subcomand of the chassis control command as described in section 28.3
of the IPMI standard.
The length of time the system is off will be at least one second, but
may be longer if the power cycle interval has been set (see section 28.9).
.Sh IOCTLS
Sending and receiving messages through the
.Nm
driver requires the use of
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The ioctls are used due to the complexity of
data sent to and from the device.
The
.Xr ioctl 2
command codes below are defined in
.In sys/ipmi.h .
The third argument to
.Xr ioctl 2
should be a pointer to the type indicated.
.Pp
Currently the following ioctls are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv IPMICTL_RECEIVE_MSG Pq Vt "struct ipmi_recv"
Receive a message.
Possible error values:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
No messages are in the process queue.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An address supplied was invalid.
.It Bq Er EMSGSIZE
The address could not fit in the message buffer and
will remain in the buffer.
.El
.It Dv IPMICTL_RECEIVE_MSG_TRUNC Pq Vt "struct ipmi_recv"
Like
.Dv IPMICTL_RECEIVE_MSG
but if the message cannot fit into the buffer, it
will truncate the contents instead of leaving the data
in the buffer.
.It Dv IPMICTL_SEND_COMMAND Pq Vt "struct ipmi_req"
Send a message to the interface.
Possible error values:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An address supplied was invalid.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Buffers could not be allowed for the command, out of memory.
.El
.It Dv IPMICTL_SET_MY_ADDRESS_CMD Pq Vt "unsigned int"
Set the slave address for source messages.
.It Dv IPMICTL_GET_MY_ADDRESS_CMD Pq Vt "unsigned int"
Get the slave address for source messages.
.It Dv IPMICTL_SET_MY_LUN_CMD Pq Vt "unsigned int"
Set the slave LUN for source messages.
.It Dv IPMICTL_GET_MY_LUN_CMD Pq Vt "unsigned int"
Get the slave LUN for source messages.
.El
.Ss Unimplemented Ioctls
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv IPMICTL_REGISTER_FOR_CMD Pq Vt "struct ipmi_cmdspec"
Register to receive a specific command.
Possible error values:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An supplied address was invalid.
.It Bq Er EBUSY
The network function/command is already in use.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Could not allocate memory.
.El
.It Dv IPMICTL_UNREGISTER_FOR_CMD Pq Vt "struct ipmi_cmdspec"
Unregister to receive a specific command.
Possible error values:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An address supplied was invalid.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The network function/command was not found.
.El
.El
.Ss Stub Only Ioctl
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv IPMICTL_SET_GETS_EVENTS_CMD Pq Vt int
Set whether this interface receives events.
Possible error values:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An address supplied was invalid.
