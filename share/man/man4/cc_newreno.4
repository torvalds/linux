.Sh NAME
.Nm cc_newreno
.Nd NewReno Congestion Control Algorithm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In netinet/cc/cc_newreno.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The NewReno congestion control algorithm is the default for TCP.
Details about the algorithm can be found in RFC5681.
.Sh Socket Options
The
.Nm
module supports a number of socket options under TCP_CCALGOOPT (refer to
.Xr tcp 4
and
.Xr moc_cc 9 for details)
which can
be set with
.Xr setsockopt 2
and tested with
.Xr getsockopt 2 .
The 
.Nm
socket options use this structure defined in
<sys/netinet/cc/cc_newreno.h>:
.Bd -literal
struct cc_newreno_opts {
	int name;
	uint32_t val;
}
.Ed
.Bl -tag -width ".Va CC_NEWRENO_BETA_ECN"
.It Va CC_NEWRENO_BETA
Multiplicative window decrease factor, specified as a percentage, applied to
the congestion window in response to a congestion signal per: cwnd = (cwnd *
CC_NEWRENO_BETA) / 100.
Default is 50.
.It Va CC_NEWRENO_BETA_ECN
Multiplicative window decrease factor, specified as a percentage, applied to
the congestion window in response to an ECN congestion signal when
.Va net.inet.tcp.cc.abe=1
per: cwnd = (cwnd * CC_NEWRENO_BETA_ECN) / 100.
Default is 80.
.El
.Sh MIB Variables
The algorithm exposes these variables in the
.Va net.inet.tcp.cc.newreno
branch of the
.Xr sysctl 3
MIB:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va beta_ecn"
.It Va beta
Multiplicative window decrease factor, specified as a percentage, applied to
the congestion window in response to a congestion signal per: cwnd = (cwnd *
beta) / 100.
Default is 50.
.It Va beta_ecn
Multiplicative window decrease factor, specified as a percentage, applied to
the congestion window in response to an ECN congestion signal when
.Va net.inet.tcp.cc.abe=1
per: cwnd = (cwnd * beta_ecn) / 100.
Default is 80.

.Sh ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Development and testing of this software were made possible in part by grants
from the FreeBSD Foundation and Cisco University Research Program Fund at
Community Foundation Silicon Valley.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
congestion control algorithm first appeared in its modular form in
.Fx 9.0 .
.Pp
The module was first released in 2007 by James Healy and Lawrence Stewart whilst
working on the NewTCP research project at Swinburne University of Technology's
Centre for Advanced Internet Architectures, Melbourne, Australia, which was made
possible in part by a grant from the Cisco University Research Program Fund at
Community Foundation Silicon Valley.
