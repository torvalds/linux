.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ng_ksocket
.Nd kernel socket netgraph node type
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In netgraph/ng_ksocket.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A
.Nm ksocket
node is both a netgraph node and a
.Bx
socket.
The
.Nm
node type allows one to open a socket inside the kernel and have
it appear as a Netgraph node.
The
.Nm
node type is the reverse of the socket node type (see
.Xr ng_socket 4 ) :
whereas the socket node type enables the user-level manipulation (via
a socket) of what is normally a kernel-level entity (the associated
Netgraph node), the
.Nm
node type enables the kernel-level manipulation (via a Netgraph node) of
what is normally a user-level entity (the associated socket).
.Pp
A
.Nm
node allows at most one hook connection.
Connecting to the node is
equivalent to opening the associated socket.
The name given to the hook
determines what kind of socket the node will open (see below).
When the hook is disconnected and/or the node is shutdown, the
associated socket is closed.
.Sh HOOKS
This node type supports a single hook connection at a time.
The name of the hook must be of the form
.Em <family>/<type>/<proto> ,
where the
.Em family ,
.Em type ,
and
.Em proto
are the decimal equivalent of the same arguments to
.Xr socket 2 .
Alternately, aliases for the commonly used values are accepted as
well.
For example
.Dv inet/dgram/udp
is a more readable but equivalent version of
.Dv 2/2/17 .
.Pp
Data received into socket is sent out via hook.
Data received on hook is sent out from socket, if the latter is
connected (an
.Dv NGM_KSOCKET_CONNECT
was sent to node before).
If socket is not connected, destination
.Vt "struct sockaddr"
must be supplied in an mbuf tag with cookie
.Dv NGM_KSOCKET_COOKIE
and type
.Dv NG_KSOCKET_TAG_SOCKADDR
attached to data.
Otherwise
.Nm
will return
.Er ENOTCONN
to sender.
.Sh CONTROL MESSAGES
This node type supports the generic control messages, plus the following:
.Bl -tag -width foo
.It Dv NGM_KSOCKET_BIND Pq Ic bind
This functions exactly like the
.Xr bind 2
system call.
The
.Vt "struct sockaddr"
socket address parameter should be supplied as an argument.
.It Dv NGM_KSOCKET_LISTEN Pq Ic listen
This functions exactly like the
.Xr listen 2
system call.
The backlog parameter (a single 32 bit
.Dv int )
should be supplied as an argument.
.It Dv NGM_KSOCKET_CONNECT Pq Ic connect
This functions exactly like the
.Xr connect 2
system call.
The
.Vt "struct sockaddr"
destination address parameter should be supplied as an argument.
.It Dv NGM_KSOCKET_ACCEPT Pq Ic accept
Equivalent to the
.Xr accept 2
system call on a non-blocking socket.
If there is a pending connection on the queue,
a new socket and a corresponding cloned node are created.
Returned are the cloned node's ID and a peer name (as
.Vt "struct sockaddr" ) .
If there are no pending connections,
this control message returns nothing,
and a connected node will receive the above message asynchronously,
when a connection is established.
.Pp
A cloned node supports a single hook with an arbitrary name.
If not connected, a node disappears when its parent node is destroyed.
Once connected, it becomes an independent node.
.It Dv NGM_KSOCKET_GETNAME Pq Ic getname
Equivalent to the
.Xr getsockname 2
system call.
The name is returned as a
.Vt "struct sockaddr"
in the arguments field of the reply.
.It Dv NGM_KSOCKET_GETPEERNAME Pq Ic getpeername
Equivalent to the
.Xr getpeername 2
system call.
The name is returned as a
.Vt "struct sockaddr"
in the arguments field of the reply.
.It Dv NGM_KSOCKET_SETOPT Pq Ic setopt
Equivalent to the
.Xr setsockopt 2
system call, except that the option name, level, and value are passed in a
.Vt "struct ng_ksocket_sockopt" .
.It Dv NGM_KSOCKET_GETOPT Pq Ic getopt
Equivalent to the
.Xr getsockopt 2
system call, except that the option is passed in a
.Vt "struct ng_ksocket_sockopt" .
When sending this command, the
.Dv value
field should be empty; upon return, it will contain the
retrieved value.
.El
.Sh ASCII FORM CONTROL MESSAGES
For control messages that pass a
.Vt "struct sockaddr"
in the argument field, the normal
.Tn ASCII
equivalent of the C structure
is an acceptable form.
For the
.Dv PF_INET
and
.Dv PF_LOCAL
address families, a more convenient form is also used, which is
the protocol family name, followed by a slash, followed by the actual
address.
For
.Dv PF_INET ,
the address is an IP address followed by an optional colon and port number.
For
.Dv PF_LOCAL ,
the address is the pathname as a doubly quoted string.
.Pp
Examples:
.Bl -tag -width "PF_LOCAL"
.It Dv PF_LOCAL
local/"/tmp/foo.socket"
.It Dv PF_INET
inet/192.168.1.1:1234
.It Other
.Dv "\&{ family=16 len=16 data=[0x70 0x00 0x01 0x23] \&}"
.El
.Pp
For control messages that pass a
.Vt "struct ng_ksocket_sockopt" ,
the normal
.Tn ASCII
form for that structure is used.
In the future, more
convenient encoding of the more common socket options may be supported.
.Pp
Setting socket options example:
.Bl -tag -width "PF_LOCAL"
.It Set FIB 2 for a socket (SOL_SOCKET, SO_SETFIB):
.Dv "setopt \&{ level=0xffff name=0x1014 data=[ 2 ] \&}"
.El
.Sh SHUTDOWN
This node shuts down upon receipt of a
.Dv NGM_SHUTDOWN
control message, or when the hook is disconnected.
Shutdown of the node closes the associated socket.
