.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm acpi_fujitsu
.Nd Fujitsu Laptop Extras
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device acpi_fujitsu"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
acpi_fujitsu_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver enables the ACPI-controlled buttons on Fujitsu notebooks.
The button events are sent to userspace via
.Xr devd 8 ,
and a
.Xr sysctl 8
interface is provided to simulate the hardware events.
.Pp
Using this driver, one can control the brightness of the display, the volume
of the speakers, and the internal (eraserhead) mouse pointer.
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
These sysctls are currently implemented:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.acpi.fujitsu.lcd_brightness
Makes the LCD backlight brighter or dimmer.
.It Va hw.acpi.fujitsu.pointer_enable
Enables or disables the internal mouse pointer.
.It Va hw.acpi.fujitsu.volume
Controls the speaker volume.
.It Va hw.acpi.fujitsu.mute
Mutes the speakers.
.El
.Pp
Defaults for these sysctls can be set in
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following can be added to
.Xr devd.conf 5
in order to pass button events to a
.Pa /usr/local/sbin/acpi_oem_exec.sh
script:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
notify 10 {
        match "system"		"ACPI";
        match "subsystem"	"FUJITSU";
        action "/usr/local/sbin/acpi_oem_exec.sh $notify fujitsu";
};
.Ed
.Pp
A possible
.Pa /usr/local/sbin/acpi_oem_exec.sh
script might look like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#!/bin/sh
#
if [ "$1" = "" -o "$2" = "" ]

        echo "usage: $0 notify oem_name"
        exit 1
