.Sh NAME
.Nm snd_mss
.Nd "Microsoft Sound System ISA PnP/non-PnP bridge device driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device sound"
.Cd "device snd_mss"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
snd_mss_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
Non-PnP cards require the following lines in
