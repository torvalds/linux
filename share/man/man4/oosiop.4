.Sh NAME
.Nm oosiop
.Nd Symbios/NCR 53C700 SCSI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "# hppa"
.Cd "oosiop* at gsc? irq 9"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn Symbios/NCR
53C700
.Tn SCSI
controller chip.
.Pp
The
.Tn Symbios/NCR
53C710
.Tn SCSI
controller is handled by the
.Xr osiop 4
driver, while the
.Tn Symbios/NCR
53C8xx
.Tn PCI
.Tn SCSI
host adapters are handled by the
.Xr siop 4
driver.
.\" .Sh CONFIGURATION
.\" The
.\" .Nm
.\" driver supports the following
.\" .Sy flags
.\" for use in
.\" .Xr config 8
.\" files:
.\" .Pp
.\" .Bl -tag -compact -width "bits 8-15:"
.\" .It bits 0-7 :
.\" disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding
.\" .Tn SCSI
.\" target
.\" .It bits 8-15 :
.\" disable synchronous negotiation for
.\" .Tn SCSI
.\" target
.\" .It bits 16 :
.\" disable DMA interrupts
.\" .El
.\" .Pp
.\" .Qq Target
.\" is synonymous with
.\" .Tn SCSI
.\" ID number.
.\" .Pp
.\" Note that
.\" .Tn SCSI
.\" tape drives should be allowed to perform disconnect/reselect or performance
.\" will suffer.
.\" .Sh BUGS
.\" Neither
.\" .Tn DMA
.\" or synchronous data transfers are currently supported.
