.Sh NAME
.Nm eisa
.Nd introduction to EISA bus support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
Machine-dependent; depends on the bus topology and
.Tn EISA
bus interface of your system.
Typical
.Tn EISA
buses are either connected directly
to the main system bus, or via an
.Tn PCI
to
.Tn EISA
bridge.
See the
.Xr intro 4
documentation for your system for details.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ox
includes a machine-independent
.Tn EISA
bus subsystem and several machine-independent
.Tn EISA
device drivers.
.Pp
.Ox
provides support for the following devices.
Note that not all architectures support all devices.
.Ss Disk and tape controllers
.Bl -tag -width 12n -offset ind -compact
.It Xr cac 4
Compaq Smart Array 2/3/4 SCSI RAID controller
.El
.Ss SCSI interfaces
.Bl -tag -width 12n -offset ind -compact
.It Xr ahc 4
Adaptec VL/EISA/PCI SCSI interface
.It Xr uha 4
Ultrastor SCSI interface
.El
.Ss Network interfaces
.Bl -tag -width 12n -offset ind -compact
.It Xr ep 4
3Com EtherLink III and Fast EtherLink III 10/100 Ethernet device
.\" .It Xr le 4
.\" Digital DE422
.\" .Tn Ethernet
.\" interfaces.
.\" .It Xr tlp 4
.\" Digital DE425
.\" .Tn Ethernet
.\" interfaces.
.El
.Pp
Note that most or all
.Tn EISA
devices also have
.Tn PCI
or
.Tn ISA
equivalents.
These are listed in
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
or
.Xr isapnp 4 ,
respectively.
The manual pages for each individual driver also lists the
supported bus variants.

.Sh HISTORY
The machine-independent
.Tn EISA
subsystem appeared in
.Ox 1.2 .
