.Nd Level 1 LXT1001 NetCellerator PCI 1Gb Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lge* at pci?"
.Cd "xmphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for various NICs based on the Level 1 LXT1001
NetCellerator Gigabit Ethernet controller chip, including the
following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Allied Telesis CentreCOM LA1000-PCI-SX
.It
D-Link DGE-500SX
.It
SMC TigerCard 1000 (SMC9462SX)
.El
.Pp
These NICs are capable of 1000Mbps speeds over fiber optic cable.
The LXT1001 also supports a GMII port for use with 10/100/1000 copper
PHYs, however there aren't currently any NICs on the market that use
this feature.
.Pp
The LXT1001 supports IPv4 receive IP/TCP/UDP checksum offload
as well as a 64-bit multicast hash filter.
It also supports jumbo frames.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It Cm 1000baseSX
Set 1000baseSX operation over fiber optic cable.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-duplex
modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
