.Sh NAME
.Nm rsu
.Nd Realtek RTL8188SU/RTL8192SU USB IEEE 802.11b/g/n wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "rsu* at uhub? port ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports USB 2.0 wireless network devices based on Realtek
RTL8188SU, RTL8191SU and RTL8192SU chipsets.
.Pp
The RTL8188SU is a highly integrated 802.11n adapter that combines
a MAC, a 1T1R capable baseband and an RF in a single chip.
It operates in the 2GHz spectrum only.
.Pp
The RTL8191SU is a highly integrated multiple-in, single-out (MISO)
802.11n adapter that combines a MAC, a 1T2R capable baseband and an
RF in a single chip.
It operates in the 2GHz spectrum only.
.Pp
The RTL8192SU is a highly integrated multiple-in, multiple-out (MIMO)
802.11n adapter that combines a MAC, a 2T2R capable baseband and an
RF in a single chip.
It operates in the 2GHz spectrum only.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA1 and WPA2).
WPA2 is currently the most secure encryption standard for wireless networks
supported by
.Ox .
It is strongly recommended that neither WEP nor WPA1
are used as the sole mechanism to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses.
WPA1 is disabled by default and may be enabled using the option
.Qq Cm wpaprotos Ar wpa1,wpa2 .
For standard WPA networks which use pre-shared keys (PSK),
keys are configured using the
.Qq Cm wpakey
option.
WPA-Enterprise networks require use of the wpa_supplicant package.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The adapter needs firmware files to run, which are loaded on demand by
the driver when the device is attached:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/rsu-rtl8712
.El
.Sh HARDWARE
The following adapters should work:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It ASUS USB-N10
.It ASUS WL-167G V3
.It Belkin F7D1101 v1
.It D-Link DWA-131 A1
.It Hercules HWGUn-54
.It Hercules HWNUm-300
.It Planex GW-USNano
.It Sitecom WL-349 v1
.It Sitecom WL-353
.It Sweex LW154
.It TRENDnet TEW-648UB
.It TRENDnet TEW-649UB
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example scans for available networks:
.Pp
.Dl # ifconfig rsu0 scan
.Pp
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example configures rsu0 to join network
.Dq mynwid ,
using WPA key
.Dq mywpakey ,
obtaining an IP address using DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
join mynwid wpakey mywpakey
inet autoconf
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "rsu0: error N, could not read firmware ..."
For some reason, the driver was unable to read the microcode file from the
filesystem.
The file might be missing or corrupted.
.It "rsu0: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.9 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Damien Bergamini Aq Mt damien.bergamini@free.fr .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver does not support any of the 802.11n capabilities offered by the
adapters.
Additional work is required in
.Xr ieee80211 9
before those features can be supported.
