.Dt UMODEM 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm umodem
.Nd USB modem support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "umodem* at uhub?"
.Cd "ucom*   at umodem?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB modems in the Communication
Device Class using the Abstract Control Model.
These modems are basically standard serial line modems, but they are
accessed via USB instead.
They support a regular AT command set.
The commands can either be multiplexed with the data stream
or handled through separate pipes.
In the latter case the AT commands have to be given on a device separate
from the data device.
.Pp
The device is accessed through the
.Xr ucom 4
driver which makes it behave like a
.Xr tty 4 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tty 4 ,
.Xr ucom 4 ,
.Xr uhub 4 ,
.Xr usb 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 2.7 .
.Sh BUGS
Only modems with multiplexed commands and data are supported
at the moment.
