.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports IPv4 receive IP/TCP/UDP checksum offload, VLAN tag
insertion and stripping, as well as a 2048-bit multicast hash filter
and up to 4 pattern match buffers.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also supports jumbo frames.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It Cm 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseT
Set 1000baseT operation over twisted pair.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-duplex
modes are supported.
.It Cm 1000baseSX
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-duplex
modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
