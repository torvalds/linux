.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

driver supports the ACPI Control Method Battery interface between the
battery and the host.
Information about the battery, such as capacity, recharge rate, voltage,
and serial number, is available through this driver.
Battery status is updated through an event triggered when a battery
changes state (such as starting to charge) and, as a failsafe if the
system does not support passing such events, every 10 seconds.
Battery status can be monitored using
.Xr sysctl 8
or
.Xr sensorsd 8 .
