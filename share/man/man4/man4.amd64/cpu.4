.Sh NAME
.Nm cpu
.Nd Central Processing Unit
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cpu0 at mainbus?"
.Cd "cpu* at mainbus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Several processor models have additional features that extend their base
functionality, such as power and frequency control or thermal monitoring.
.Pp
The
.Xr sysctl 2
.Va hw.cpuspeed
returns the current operating frequency of the processor,
though on some processors this value may be only an approximation.
If possible, speed may be adjusted by altering
.Va hw.setperf
from 0 to 100,
representing percentage of maximum speed.
.Pp
There are several possible implementations for speed adjustment,
all transparent to the user:
.Bl -tag -width tenletters
.It EST
Enhanced SpeedStep found on Intel and VIA processors,
offering frequency scaling with numerous positions.
.It PowerNow
Found on various AMD processors.
It currently only supports a limited set of models in the K8 families.
.El
.Pp
The presence of extended instruction sets can be determined by the sysctl
.Va machdep :
.Bl -tag -width "tenletters"
.It xcrypt
Supports the VIA AES encryption instruction set.
.El
.Pp
The sysctl
.Va hw.sensors
returns the current temperature reported by the processor.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh BUGS
Due to the way in which thermal information is reported on Intel processors,
the temperature may be off by exactly +/-15 degrees C.
.Pp
For multiprocessor kernels with more than one CPU sensor,
processors report identical temperatures
since the temperature is taken from the processor running the sensors update.
