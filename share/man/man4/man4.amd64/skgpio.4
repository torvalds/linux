.Dt SKGPIO 4 amd64
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm skgpio
.Nd Soekris net6501 GPIO and LEDs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "skgpio0 at isa? port 0x680"
.Cd "gpio* at skgpio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the GPIO and LEDs as implemented by the Xilinx
Spartan FGPA integrated into the Soekris net6501 programmed with the default
bitstream found in the BIOS.
.Pp
Two standard
.Xr gpio 4
interfaces are provided, one for the 16 real pins which can be configured as
either inputs or outputs and another with 2 output-only pins that map
to the error and ready LEDs respectively.
Both may be used with
.Xr gpioctl 8 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gpio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr gpioctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 5.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Matt Dainty Aq matt@bodgit-n-scarper.com .
.Sh BUGS
If the Xilinx FPGA is programmed with a different bitstream, the driver will
likely not function.
