.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Intel Atom E600 series LPC bridge and
implements a 64-bit 14.3 MHz timecounter using the HPET timer.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also provides the standard
.Xr watchdog 4
interface to the watchdog timer and may be used with
.Xr watchdogd 8 .
The watchdog timer can be configured via

Once the watchdog timer resets the CPU, the driver reports it on the
next boot displaying the
.Dq reboot on timeout
message in the
.Xr dmesg 8 .
.Pp
The maximum timeout value supported by the watchdog timer is 600
seconds.
