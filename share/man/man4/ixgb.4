.Sh NAME
.Nm ixgb
.Nd Intel PRO/10GbE 10Gb Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ixgb* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI-X 10Gb Ethernet adapters based on the
Intel 82597EX Ethernet controller chips.
The driver supports IPv4 receive IP/TCP/UDP checksum offload, VLAN tag
insertion and stripping, and jumbo frames.
This includes the following models:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
Intel PRO/10GbE CX4 Server Adapter (PXLA8591CX4)
.It
Intel PRO/10GbE LR Server Adapter (PXLA8591LR)
.It
Intel PRO/10GbE SR Server Adapter (PXLA8591SR)
.It
Sun 10 Gigabit Ethernet PCI-X Adapter (X5544A-4)
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width autoselect -offset indent
.It autoselect
Enables auto-negotiation for speed and duplex.
.It 10GbaseLR
Sets 10Gbps operation.
Only full-duplex mode is supported at this speed.
.It 10GbaseSR
Sets 10Gbps operation.
Only full-duplex mode is supported at this speed.
.El

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.9 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Intel Corporation .
.Sh BUGS
Under small packet UDP stress tests with 10GbE driver, the
.Ox
system will drop UDP packets due to the fullness of the socket buffers.
You may want to change the driver's Flow Control variables to the minimum
value for controlling packet reception.
.Pp
Excessive CRC errors may be observed if the Intel PRO/10GbE CX4 Server
adapter is connected to a Fujitsu XENPAK CX4 module in a SmartBits chassis
using 15m/24AWG cable assemblies manufactured by Fujitsu or Leoni.
The CRC errors may be received either by the Intel PRO/10GbE CX4 Server
adapter or the SmartBits.
If this situation occurs, using a different cable assembly may resolve the
issue.
.Pp
Excessive CRC errors may be observed if the Intel PRO/10GbE CX4 Server
adapter is connected to an HP Procurve 3400cl switch port using short cables
(1m or shorter).
If this situation occurs, using a longer cable may resolve the issue.
.Pp
Excessive CRC errors may be observed using Fujitsu 24AWG cable assemblies that
are 10m or longer or where using a Leoni 15 m/24AWG cable assembly.
The CRC errors may be received either by the CX4 Server adapter
or at the switch.
If this situation occurs, using a different cable assembly
may resolve the issue.
