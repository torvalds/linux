.Dt UKPHY 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ukphy
.Nd generic/unknown IEEE 802.3u Ethernet PHY
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ukphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the basic functionality of most Ethernet PHYs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ifmedia 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr mii 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh CAVEATS
In areas where the programming interface for PHYs differ, such
as detecting the currently active medium, this driver often
does not work optimally.
When available, it is best to use a PHY-specific driver.
