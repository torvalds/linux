.Sh NAME
.Nm rtwn
.Nd Realtek IEEE 802.11 wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options RTWN_DEBUG"
.Cd "options RTWN_WITHOUT_UCODE"
.Pp
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device rtwn"
.Cd "device rtwnfw"
.Cd "device rtwn_usb"
.Cd "device rtwn_pci"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Cd "device firmware"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_rtwn_pci_load="YES"
if_rtwn_usb_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for wireless network devices based on
the Realtek RTL8192C, RTL8188E, RTL8192E, RTL8812A and RTL8821A
programming APIs.
These APIs are used by a wide variety of chips;
most chips with USB and some with PCI interface are supported.
.Pp
To enable use for PCI/PCIe systems, see the rtwn_pci(4) driver;
for USB devices, use the rtwn_usb(4) driver.
.Pp
The driver supports
.Cm station ,
.Cm adhoc ,
.Cm hostap
and
.Cm monitor
mode operation.
There are no limitations for number of
.Cm monitor
mode
virtual interfaces; in addition to any other virtual interface
one
.Cm station
interface can be added (Note: RTL8821AU supports two non-monitor
mode interfaces at the same time).
.Pp
All chips have hardware support for WEP, AES-CCM and TKIP encryption.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8 .

.Pp
The driver (if not compiled with
.Cd options RTWN_WITHOUT_UCODE
) may use following firmware files, which are loaded
when an interface is brought up:

.Sh EXAMPLES
Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev rtwn0 inet 192.168.0.20 \e
    netmask 0xffffff00
.Ed
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Pp
.Dl "ifconfig wlan create wlandev rtwn0 ssid my_net up"
.Pp
Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev rtwn0 ssid my_net \e
        wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up
.Ed
.Pp
Create an IBSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption on the channel 4:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev rtwn0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \e
	wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey 1 \e
	channel 4
.Ed
.Pp
Join/create an 802.11b IBSS network with network name
.Dq Li my_net :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev rtwn0 wlanmode adhoc
ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \e
	mode 11b
.Ed
.Pp
Create a host-based access point:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev rtwn0 wlanmode hostap
ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.0.10 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_ap
.Ed
.Sh LOADER TUNABLES
Tunables can be set at the
.Xr loader 8
prompt before booting the kernel or stored in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va dev.rtwn.%d.hwcrypto
This tunable controls how key slots are assigned:
.br
0 - disable h/w crypto support. Features that require access
to frame contents (e.g., TCP/UDP/IP Rx checksum validation)
will not work;
.br
1 - use h/w crypto support for pairwise keys only;
.br
2 - use h/w crypto support for all keys; may not work for
multi-vap configurations.
.br
By default it is set to 1.
.It Va dev.rtwn.%d.ratectl
This tunable switches between rate control implementations:
.br
0 - no rate control;
.br
1 - driver sends 'tx complete' reports to net80211; algorithm
is controlled via net80211;
.br
2 - firmware-based rate control.
.br
By default it is set to 1; however driver may choose another
algorithm in case if it is not implemented
.br
Currently selected algorithm is reported via
.Em Va dev.rtwn.%d.ratectl_selected
read-only OID.
.It Va dev.rtwn.%d.rx_buf_size
(USB only) Controls size of temporary Rx buffer; smaller buffer size
may increase number of interrupts.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "rtwn%d: could not read efuse byte at address 0x%x"
.It "rtwn%d: %s: cannot read rom, error %d"
There was an error while reading ROM; device attach will be aborted.
This should not happen.
.It "rtwn%d: failed loadfirmware of file %s"
For some reason, the driver was unable to read the microcode file from the
filesystem.
The file might be missing or corrupted.
The driver will disable firmware-dependent features.
.It "rtwn%d: wrong firmware size (%zu)"
.It "rtwn%d: %s: failed to upload firmware %s (error %d)"
.It "rtwn%d: timeout waiting for firmware readiness"
Firmware upload failed; the file might be corrupted.
The driver will disable firmware-dependent features.
This should not happen.
.It "rtwn%d: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
