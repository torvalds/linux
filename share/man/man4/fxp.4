.Nd Intel EtherExpress PRO/100 10/100 Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "fxp* at pci?"

.Cd "icsphy* at mii?"
.Cd "inphy* at mii?"
.Cd "iophy* at mii?"
.Cd "nsphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports the Intel EtherExpress 100 family of Ethernet cards
based on various revisions of the i82557, i82558, i82559, i82559S,
i82550, i82551, and i82562 chipsets, including the following:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
Intel EtherExpress PRO/100 PCI
.It
Intel EtherExpress PRO/100B PCI
.It
Intel EtherExpress PRO/100+ PCI
.It
Intel EtherExpress PRO/100 Dual-Port PCI
.It
Intel PRO/100 CardBus II PC Card
.It
Intel PRO/100 VE
.It
Intel PRO/100 VM
.It
Intel PRO/100 M
.It
Intel PRO/100 S
.El
.Pp
The following media types and options (as given to
.Xr ifconfig 8 )
are supported:
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent
.It Cm media No autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options (default).
.It Cm media No 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation and force full-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation and force half-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 10baseT Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 10Mbps operation and force full-duplex.
.It Cm media No 10baseT Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 10Mbps operation and force half-duplex.
.El
.Pp
If no media options are present, the
.Nm
driver places the card into autoselect mode.
.Sh FILES
Some devices are able to do interrupt coalescing but it requires firmware
updating.
The following firmware files are potentially loaded on demand when an
interface is brought up:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/fxp-d101a
.It Pa /etc/firmware/fxp-d101b0
.It Pa /etc/firmware/fxp-d101ma
.It Pa /etc/firmware/fxp-d101s
.It Pa /etc/firmware/fxp-d102
.It Pa /etc/firmware/fxp-d102c
.It Pa /etc/firmware/fxp-d102e
.El
.Pp
If a file is missing, the driver attempts to operate anyway.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "fxp0: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "fxp0: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "fxp0: Failed to malloc memory"
There are not enough mbufs available for allocation.
.It "fxp0: device timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.It "fxp0: error N, could not read firmware ..."
The device is able to do interrupt coalescing but required firmware file
is missing.
