.Sh NAME
.Nm urng
.Nd USB Random Number Generator devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "urng* at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for various true random number generator
(TRNG) devices connected via USB.
.Nm
reads raw entropy from the device at a (hardware dependent) interval
and stirs it into the system entropy pool with
.Xr enqueue_randomness 9 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The following devices are supported by this driver:
.Bl -tag -width "Altus Metrum"
.It Araneus Alea I and II
Capable of delivering 100kbit/sec of hardware-generated entropy.
.It Altus Metrum ChaosKey 1.0
This device is capable of providing entropy at 10Mbit/s.
