.Sh NAME
.Nm hsq
.Nd multiplexing serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hsq0 at isa? port 0x140 irq 10"
.Cd "com* at hsq?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Hostess
.Pq Lk https://www.comtrol.com/ "Comtrol Corporation"
and compatible boards that multiplex together up to four
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pq Tn CCITT V.28
communications interfaces.
.Pp
Each
.Nm
device is the master device for up to four
.Nm com
devices.
The kernel configuration specifies these
.Nm com
devices as slave devices of the
.Nm
device, as shown in
.Sx SYNOPSIS .
The slave ID given for each
.Nm com
device determines which bit in the interrupt multiplexing register is
tested to find interrupts for that device.
The
.Cd port
specification for the
.Nm
device is used to compute the base addresses for the
.Nm com
subdevices (they are equal to port + ID * 8) and the port for
the interrupt multiplexing register (it is equal to port + 7).
More technical details on how the driver works can be found in
the big comment at the beginning of the driver's source code.
.Pp
Information on setup of card's configuration switches should be taken
from Comtrol Corporation's web site, since the author wrote and tested
the driver only with Hostess-compatible cards.
