.Sh NAME
.Nm pppx ,
.Nm pppac
.Nd PPP multiplexer device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device pppx"
.Pp
.In sys/socket.h
.In sys/ioctl.h
.In net/pipex.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm pppx
and
.Nm pppac
drivers works with the
.Xr npppd 8
daemon to provide network interfaces for Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
sessions by request from the daemon.
.Nm pppx
operates by allocating a network interface for each PPP
session.
.Nm pppac
concentrates multiple PPP sessions on a single network interface.
The interfaces also work with
.Xr pipex 4
to accelerate the performance of data packet forwarding,
and supports ioctls which are added by
.Xr pipex 4 .
.Pp
To use
.Nm pppx
or
.Nm pppac
from
.Xr npppd 8
the administrator needs to configure the interface configuration in
.Xr npppd.conf 5 .
Also the administrator needs to enable
.Xr pipex 4
by setting
.Va net.pipex.enable
to
.Sq 1
using
.Xr sysctl 8 .
