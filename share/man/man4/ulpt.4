.Sh NAME
.Nm ulpt
.Nd USB printer support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ulpt*   at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB printers that follow the printer
bi- or uni-directional protocol.
The bits in the minor number select various features of the driver.
.Bl -column "Minor Bit" "Functionxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" -offset indent
.It Em "Minor Bit" Ta Em Function
.It 64 Ta "Do not initialize the device on the port."

.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa
.It Pa /dev/ulpt?
.El
.Pp
For some HP LaserJet printer models (1000, 1005, 1018, 1020), the driver needs
at least version 1.0 of the following firmware files, which are loaded when a
printer is attached:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It /etc/firmware/ulpt-hp1000
.It /etc/firmware/ulpt-hp1005
.It /etc/firmware/ulpt-hp1018
.It /etc/firmware/ulpt-hp1020
.El
.Pp
These firmware files are not free because HP refuses to grant
distribution rights.
As a result, even though
.Ox
includes the driver, the firmware files cannot be included and
users have to download these files on their own.
A port which can download and install the firmware can be found in
.Pa /usr/ports/sysutils/firmware/ulpt .
