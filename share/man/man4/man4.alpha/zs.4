.Nd Zilog 8530 (ZSCC) Serial Communications Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "zs*    at ioasic0"
.\" .Cd "lskbd* at zs1"
.\" .Cd "vsms*  at zs0"
.Cd "zstty* at zs?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides TTY support for the two Zilog 8530 Dual UART chips found on
DEC 3000 systems.
On these systems, two of these serial interfaces are hardwired for use by the
keyboard and mouse.
Only the second interface of each
.Nm
controller can be used as a regular serial port.
.\" The
.\" .Nm lskbd
.\" devices connect keyboard devices to the generic keyboard driver
.\" .Nm wskbd .
.\" The
.\" .Nm vsms
.\" devices connect mice to the generic mouse driver
.\" .Xr wsmouse 4 .
The
.Nm zstty
interfaces provide RS-423
and RS-232 serial ports for general purpose use.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports all of the standard
.Xr tty 4
ioctl calls.
The status of the DTR, RTS, CTS, and DCD signals can be queried with
the TIOCMGET command but, due to limitations in the hardware,
only the DTR and RTS signals can be modified with the TIOCMSET, TIOCMBIC,
and TIOCMBIS
.Xr ioctl 2
commands.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may be set to any baud rate in the
range 50 to 38400.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It zs*: fifo overflow
The on-chip
.Dq FIFO
has overflowed and incoming data has been lost.
This generally means the machine is not responding to
interrupts from the ZS chip fast enough, which can be
remedied only by using a lower baud rate.
.It zs*: ring overflow
The software input
.Qq ring
has overflowed.
This usually means input flow-control is not configured correctly
.Pq i.e. incorrect cable wiring .
