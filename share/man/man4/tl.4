.Sh NAME
.Nm tl
.Nd Texas Instruments ThunderLAN 10/100 Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tl* at pci?"
.Cd "lxtphy* at mii?"
.Cd "mlphy* at mii?"
.Cd "nsphy* at mii?"
.Cd "tlphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI Ethernet adapters based on the Texas
Instruments ThunderLAN Ethernet controller chip.
This includes a large number of Compaq PCI-bus Ethernet adapters as well as
the integrated Ethernet controllers built in to several models
of Compaq Prosignia servers and Compaq Deskpro desktop machines.
This driver also supports the Olicom OC-2135/2138, OC-2325 and OC-2326
10/100 TX UTP adapters and the Racore 8165 10/100baseTX and 8148
10baseT/100baseTX/100baseFX multi-personality cards.
.Pp
The ThunderLAN controller has a standard MII interface that supports
up to 32 physical interface devices (PHYs).
It also has a built-in 10baseT PHY hardwired at MII address 31, which may be
used in some 10Mbps-only hardware configurations.
In 100Mbps configurations, a National Semiconductor DP83840A or other
MII-compliant PHY may be attached to the ThunderLAN's MII bus.
If a DP83840A or equivalent is available, the ThunderLAN chip can operate
at either 100Mbps or 10Mbps in either half-duplex or full-duplex modes.
The ThunderLAN's built-in PHY and the DP83840A also support autonegotiation.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
Note that this option is only available on those PHYs that support
autonegotiation.
Also, the PHY will not advertise those modes that have been explicitly
disabled using the following media options.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
.It 10base5
Enable AUI/BNC interface (useful only with the built-in PHY).
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.It hw-loopback
Enable hardware loopback mode.
.El
.Pp
Note that the 100baseTX media type is only available if supported
by the PHY.
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "tl0: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "tl0: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "tl0: device timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.It "tl0: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
.It "tl0: no memory for tx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the transmitter ring when
allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a cluster.
