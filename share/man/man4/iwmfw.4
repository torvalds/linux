.Sh NAME
.Nm iwmfw
.Nd "Firmware Module for Intel Wireless driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this module into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iwmfw"
.Ed
.Pp
This will include firmware images for all
.Xr iwm 4
devices inside the kernel.
If you want to pick only the firmware image for your network adapter choose one
of the following:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iwm3160fw"
.Cd "device iwm3168fw"
.Cd "device iwm7260fw"
.Cd "device iwm7265fw"
.Cd "device iwm8000Cfw"
.Cd "device iwm8265fw"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
iwm3160fw_load="YES"
iwm3168fw_load="YES"
iwm7260fw_load="YES"
iwm7265fw_load="YES"
iwm7265Dfw_load="YES"
iwm8000Cfw_load="YES"
iwm8265fw_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This module provides access to firmware sets for the
Intel Dual Band Wireless WiFi 3160, 3165, 3168, 7260, 7265, 8000, and 8260 series of
IEEE 802.11n/11ac adapters.
It may be
statically linked into the kernel, or loaded as a module.
