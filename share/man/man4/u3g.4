.Sh NAME
.Nm u3g
.Nd USB support for 3G datacards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device ucom"
.Cd "device u3g"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
u3g_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
If neither of the above is done, the driver will automatically be loaded
by devd(8) when the device is connected.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the multiple USB-to-serial interfaces exposed by
many 3G USB/PCCard modems.
.Pp
The device is accessed through the
.Xr ucom 4
driver which makes it behave like a
.Xr tty 4 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Option GT 3G Fusion, GT Fusion Quad, etc. (only 3G part, not WLAN)
.It
Option GT 3G, GT 3G Quad, etc.
.It
Vodafone Mobile Connect Card 3G
.It
Vodafone Mobile Broadband K3772-Z
.It
Qualcomm Inc. CDMA MSM
.It
Huawei B190, E180v, E220 ('<Huawei Mobile>')
.It
Novatel U740, MC950D, X950D, etc.
.It
Sierra MC875U, MC8775U, etc.
.El
.Pp
(See
.Pa /sys/dev/usb/serial/u3g.c
for the complete list of supported cards for each vendor
mentioned above.)
.Pp
The supported 3G cards provide the necessary modem port for ppp, or mpd
connections as well as extra ports (depending on the specific device) to
provide other functions (additional command port, diagnostic port, SIM toolkit
port).
.Pp
In some of these devices a mass storage device supported by the
.Xr umass 4
driver is present which contains Windows and Mac OS X drivers.
The device starts up in disk mode (TruInstall, ZeroCD, etc.) and requires
additional commands to switch it to modem mode.
If your device is not switching automatically, please try to add quirks.
See
.Xr usbconfig 8
and
.Xr usb_quirk 4 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/dev/ttyU*.*.init" -compact
.It Pa /dev/ttyU*.*
for callin ports
.It Pa /dev/ttyU*.*.init
.It Pa /dev/ttyU*.*.lock
corresponding callin initial-state and lock-state devices
.Pp
.It Pa /dev/cuaU*.*
for callout ports
.It Pa /dev/cuaU*.*.init
.It Pa /dev/cuaU*.*.lock
corresponding callout initial-state and lock-state devices
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Connect to the Internet using the default configuration:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ppp -background u3g
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tty 4 ,
.Xr ucom 4 ,
.Xr usb 4 ,
.Xr usb_quirk 4 ,
.Xr devd 8 ,
.Xr ppp 8 ,
.Xr usbconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Fx 7.2 ,
is based on the
.Xr uark 4
driver, and written by
.An Andrea Guzzo Aq Mt aguzzo@anywi.com
in September 2008.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Andrea Guzzo Aq Mt aguzzo@anywi.com
and
.An Nick Hibma Aq Mt n_hibma@FreeBSD.org .
Hardware for testing was provided by AnyWi Technologies, Leiden, NL.
.Sh BUGS
The automatic mode switch from disk mode to modem mode does not work unless
the driver is either built into the kernel or loaded before the device is
connected.
