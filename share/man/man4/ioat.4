.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides a kernel API to a variety of DMA engines on some Intel server
platforms.
.Pp
There is a number of DMA channels per CPU package.
(Typically 4 or 8.)
Each may be used independently.
Operations on a single channel proceed sequentially.
.Pp
Blockfill operations can be used to write a 64-bit pattern to memory.
.Pp
Copy operations can be used to offload memory copies to the DMA engines.
.Pp
Null operations do nothing, but may be used to test the interrupt and callback
mechanism.
.Pp
All operations can optionally trigger an interrupt at completion with the
.Ar DMA_INT_EN
flag.
For example, a user might submit multiple operations to the same channel and
only enable an interrupt and callback for the last operation.
.Pp
The hardware can delay and coalesce interrupts on a given channel for a
configurable period of time, in microseconds.
This may be desired to reduce the processing and interrupt overhead per
descriptor, especially for workflows consisting of many small operations.
Software can control this on a per-channel basis with the
.Fn ioat_set_interrupt_coalesce
API.
The
.Fn ioat_get_max_coalesce_period
API can be used to determine the maximum coalescing period supported by the
hardware, in microseconds.
Current platforms support up to a 16.383 millisecond coalescing period.
Optimal configuration will vary by workflow and desired operation latency.
.Pp
All operations are safe to use in a non-blocking context with the
.Ar DMA_NO_WAIT
flag.
(Of course, allocations may fail and operations requested with
.Ar DMA_NO_WAIT
may return NULL.)
.Pp
Operations that depend on the result of prior operations should use
.Ar DMA_FENCE .
For example, such a scenario can happen when two related DMA operations are
queued.
First, a DMA copy to one location (A), followed directly by a DMA copy
from A to B.
In this scenario, some classes of I/OAT hardware may prefetch A for the second
operation before it is written by the first operation.
To avoid reading a stale value in sequences of dependent operations, use
.Ar DMA_FENCE .
.Pp
All operations, as well as
.Fn ioat_get_dmaengine ,
can return NULL in special circumstances.
For example, if the
.Nm
driver is being unloaded, or the administrator has induced a hardware reset, or
a usage error has resulted in a hardware error state that needs to be recovered
from.
.Pp
It is invalid to attempt to submit new DMA operations in a
.Fa bus_dmaengine_callback_t
context.
.Pp
The CRC operations have three distinct modes.
The default mode is to accumulate.
By accumulating over multiple descriptors, a user may gather a CRC over several
chunks of memory and only write out the result once.
.Pp
The
.Ar DMA_CRC_STORE
flag causes the operation to emit the CRC32C result.
If
.Ar DMA_CRC_INLINE
is set, the result is written inline with the destination data (or source in
.Fn ioat_crc
mode).
If
.Ar DMA_CRC_INLINE
is not set, the result is written to the provided
.Fa crcptr .
.Pp
Similarly, the
.Ar DMA_CRC_TEST
flag causes the operation to compare the CRC32C result to an existing checksum.
If
.Ar DMA_CRC_INLINE
is set, the result is compared against the inline four bytes trailing the
source data.
If it is not set, the result is compared against the value pointed to by
.Fa crcptr .
.Pp
.Fn ioat_copy_crc
calculates a CRC32C while copying data.
.Fn ioat_crc
only computes a CRC32C of some data.
If the
.Fa initialseed
argument to either routine is non-NULL, the CRC32C engine is initialized with
the value it points to.
.Sh USAGE
A typical user will lookup the DMA engine object for a given channel with
.Fn ioat_get_dmaengine .
When the user wants to offload a copy, they will first
.Fn ioat_acquire
the
.Ar bus_dmaengine_t
object for exclusive access to enqueue operations on that channel.
Optionally, the user can reserve space by using
.Fn ioat_acquire_reserve
instead.
If
.Fn ioat_acquire_reserve
succeeds, there is guaranteed to be room for
.Fa N
new operations in the internal ring buffer.
.Pp
Then, they will submit one or more operations using
.Fn ioat_blockfill ,
.Fn ioat_copy ,
.Fn ioat_copy_8k_aligned ,
.Fn ioat_copy_crc ,
.Fn ioat_crc ,
or
.Fn ioat_null .
After queuing one or more individual DMA operations, they will
.Fn ioat_release
the
.Ar bus_dmaengine_t
to drop their exclusive access to the channel.
The routine they provided for the
.Fa callback_fn
argument will be invoked with the provided
.Fa callback_arg
when the operation is complete.
When they are finished with the
.Ar bus_dmaengine_t ,
the user should
.Fn ioat_put_dmaengine .
.Pp
Users MUST NOT block between
.Fn ioat_acquire
and
.Fn ioat_release .
Users SHOULD NOT hold
.Ar bus_dmaengine_t
references for a very long time to enable fault recovery and kernel module
unload.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx 11.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was developed by
.An \&Jim Harris Aq Mt jimharris@FreeBSD.org ,
.An \&Carl Delsey Aq Mt carl.r.delsey@intel.com ,
and
.An \&Conrad Meyer Aq Mt cem@FreeBSD.org .

.Sh CAVEATS
Copy operation takes bus addresses as parameters, not virtual addresses.
.Pp
Buffers for individual copy operations must be physically contiguous.
.Pp
Copies larger than max transfer size (1MB, but may vary by hardware) are not
supported.
Future versions will likely support this by breaking up the transfer into
smaller sizes.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver only supports blockfill, copy, and null operations at this time.
The driver does not yet support advanced DMA modes, such as XOR, that some
I/OAT devices support.
