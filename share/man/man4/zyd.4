.Sh NAME
.Nm zyd
.Nd ZyDAS ZD1211/ZD1211B USB IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device ehci"
.Cd "device uhci"
.Cd "device ohci"
.Cd "device usb"
.Cd "device zyd"
.Cd "device wlan"
.Cd "device wlan_amrr"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_zyd_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for wireless network adapters based around
the ZyDAS ZD1211 and ZD1211B USB chips.
.Pp
.Nm
supports
.Cm station
and
.Cm monitor
mode operation.
Only one virtual interface may be configured at any time.
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following
example configures zyd0 to join any BSS network using WEP key
.Dq 0x1deadbeef1 ,
channel 11:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev zyd0 channel 11 \e
    wepmode on wepkey 0x1deadbeef1 weptxkey 1 \e
    inet 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
.Ed
.Pp
Join an existing BSS network,
.Dq my_net :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ifconfig wlan create wlandev zyd0 192.168.0.2 \e
    netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "zyd%d: could not load firmware (error=%d)"
An error occurred while attempting to upload the firmware to the onboard
microcontroller unit.
.It "zyd%d: could not send command (error=%s)"
An attempt to send a command to the firmware failed.
.It "zyd%d: sorry, radio %s is not supported yet"
Support for the specified radio chip is not yet implemented in the driver.
The device will not attach.
.It "zyd%d: device version mismatch: 0x%x (only >= 43.30 supported)"
Early revisions of the ZD1211 chipset are not supported by this driver.
The device will not attach.
.It "zyd%d: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.

.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The original
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Florian Stoehr Aq Mt ich@florian-stoehr.de ,
.An Damien Bergamini Aq Mt damien@openbsd.org ,
and
.An Jonathan Gray Aq Mt jsg@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver does not support a lot of the functionality available in the hardware.
More work is required to properly support the IBSS and power management
features.
