.Dt RDOMAIN 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rtable ,
.Nm rdomain
.Nd routing tables and routing domains
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The traditional kernel routing system had a single table for routes and
allowed only non-conflicting IP address assignments.
The
.Nm rtable
feature allows multiple lookup tables for routes.
The
.Nm rdomain
feature provides a way to logically segment a router
between network paths.
.Ss Routing tables
Each
.Nm rtable
contains routes for outbound network packets.
A routing domain can contain more than one
.Nm rtable .
Multiple routing tables are commonly used for Policy Based Routing.
.Pp
The highest ID that can be used for an
.Nm rtable
is 255.
.Ss Routing domains
Each
.Nm rdomain
is a completely separate address space in the kernel.
An IP address (e.g. 10.0.0.1/16) can be assigned in more than one
.Nm rdomain ,
but cannot be assigned more than once per
.Nm rdomain .
An interface belongs to one and only one
.Nm rdomain .
The interface's
.Nm rdomain
determines which rdomain an incoming packet will
be in.
Virtual interfaces do not need to belong to the same
.Nm rdomain
as the parent.
Each
.Nm rdomain
contains at least one routing table.
.Pp
Network traffic within an
.Nm rdomain
stays within the current routing domain.
.Xr pf 4
is used to move traffic from one
.Nm rdomain
to a different
.Nm rdomain .
.Pp
When an interface is assigned to a non-existent
.Nm rdomain ,
it gets created automatically.
At the same time an
.Nm rtable
with the same ID and a
.Xr lo 4
interface with a unit number matching the ID get created and assigned to the new
domain.
.Pp
An rdomain can be deleted by removing all interfaces from it and then
destroying the
.Xr lo 4
interface with the unit number matching the ID.
.Pp
The highest ID that can be used for an
.Nm rdomain
is 255.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Put em0 and lo4 in rdomain 4:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig em0 rdomain 4
# ifconfig lo4 inet 127.0.0.1/8
# ifconfig em0 192.0.2.100/24
.Ed
.Pp
List all rdomains with associated interfaces and routing tables:
.Pp
.Dl $ netstat -R
.Pp
Set a default route and localhost reject route within rtable 4:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# route -T4 -qn add -net 127 127.0.0.1 -reject
# route -T4 -n add default 192.0.2.1
.Ed
.Pp
Start
.Xr sshd 8
in rtable 4:
.Pp
.Dl # route -T4 exec /usr/sbin/sshd
.Pp
Display the routing table used by each process:
.Pp
.Dl $ ps aux -o rtable
.Pp
Display the routing table of the current process:
.Pp
.Dl $ id -R
.Pp
A
.Xr pf.conf 5
snippet to block incoming port 80,
and nat-to and move to rtable 0 on interface em1:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
block in on rdomain 4 proto tcp to any port 80
match out on rdomain 4 to !$internal_net nat-to (em1) rtable 0
.Ed
.Pp
Delete rdomain 4 again:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig em0 -rdomain
# ifconfig lo4 destroy
.Ed

.Sh HISTORY
.Ox
support for
.Nm rdomain
first appeared in
.Ox 4.9
and IPv6 support first appeared in
.Ox 5.5 .
.Sh CAVEATS
No tool is available to assign more than one rtable to an rdomain
other than to the default one (0).
.Pp
An rtable cannot be deleted.
Deleting an rdomain will move its rtable into the default rdomain.
