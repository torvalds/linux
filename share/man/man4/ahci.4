.Sh NAME
.Nm ahci
.Nd Advanced Host Controller Interface for Serial ATA
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ahci* at acpi?"
.Cd "ahci* at fdt?"
.Cd "ahci* at pci?"
.Cd "ahci* at jmb?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Serial ATA controllers conforming to the
Advanced Host Controller Interface specification.
.Pp
Several AHCI capable controllers also provide a compatibility mode that
causes them to appear as a traditional ATA controller supported by
.Xr pciide 4 .
.Pp
Although
.Nm
controllers are actual ATA controllers, the driver emulates SCSI via a
translation layer.
.Pp
Setting the lowest bit (0x1) of the driver flags forces
.Nm
to negotiate SATA 1 (1.5 Gb/s) transfer speeds only.
It may be useful where higher speeds are unstable.
