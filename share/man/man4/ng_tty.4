.Dt NG_TTY 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ng_tty
.Nd netgraph node type that is also a TTY hook
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/ttycom.h
.In netgraph/ng_tty.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tty
node type is both a netgraph node type and a TTY hook.
.Pp
The node has a single hook called
.Dv hook .
Incoming bytes received on the tty device are sent out on this hook,
and frames received on
.Dv hook
are transmitted out on the tty device.
No modification to the data is performed in either direction.
While the hook is installed on a tty, the normal read and write
operations are unavailable, returning
.Er EIO .
.Pp
Incoming data is delivered directly to ng_tty via the tty bypass hook as a
buffer pointer and length, this is converted to a mbuf and passed to the peer.
.Pp
The node supports an optional
.Dq hot character .
If the driver can not deliver data directly to the tty bypass hook then each
character is input one at a time.
If set to non-zero and bypass mode is unavailable, incoming
data from the tty device is queued until this character is seen.
This avoids sending lots of mbufs containing a small number of bytes,
but introduces potentially infinite latency.
The default hot character is 0x7e, consistent with
.Dv hook
being connected to a
.Xr ng_async 4
type node.
The hot character has no effect on the transmission of data.
.Sh HOOKS
This node type supports the following hooks:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va hook"
.It Va hook
.Xr tty 4
serial data contained in
.Dv mbuf
structures, with arbitrary inter-frame boundaries.
.El
.Sh CONTROL MESSAGES
This node type supports the generic control messages, plus the following:
.Bl -tag -width foo
.It Dv NGM_TTY_SET_HOTCHAR
This command takes an integer argument and sets the hot character
from the lower 8 bits.
A hot character of zero disables queueing,
so that all received data is forwarded immediately.
.It Dv NGM_TTY_GET_HOTCHAR
Returns an integer containing the current hot character in the lower
eight bits.
.It Dv NGM_TTY_SET_TTY
This command takes integer process ID and file descriptor of open tty
and registers the tty hooks.
.El
.Sh SHUTDOWN
This node shuts down when the corresponding device is closed.

.Xr netgraph 4 ,

.Xr tty 4 ,
.Xr ngctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
node type was implemented in
.Fx 4.0 .

.Sh BUGS
The serial driver code also has a notion of a
.Dq hot character .
Unfortunately, this value is statically defined in terms of the
line discipline and cannot be changed.
Therefore, if a hot character other than 0x7e (the default) is set for the
.Nm
node, the node has no way to convey this information to the
serial driver, and sub-optimal performance may result.
