.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
system provides a simple interface to the GPIO pins that are usually
available on embedded architectures and can provide bit banging style
devices to the system.
.Pp
The acronym
.Li GPIO
means
.Dq General-Purpose Input/Output.
.Pp
The BUS physically consists of multiple pins that can be configured
for input/output, IRQ delivery, SDA/SCL
.Em iicbus
use, etc.
.Pp
On some embedded architectures (like MIPS), discovery of the bus and
configuration of the pins is done via
.Xr device.hints 5
in the platform's kernel
.Xr config 5
file.
.Pp
On some others (like ARM), where
.Xr FDT 4
is used to describe the device tree, the bus discovery is done via the DTS
passed to the kernel, being either statically compiled in, or by a variety
of ways where the boot loader (or Open Firmware enabled system) passes the
DTS blob to the kernel at boot.
.Pp
The following
.Xr device.hints 5
are only provided by the
.Cd ar71xx_gpio
driver:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va hint.gpioiic.%d.atXXX"
.It Va hint.gpio.%d.pinmask
This is a bitmask of pins on the GPIO board that we would like to expose
for use to the host operating system.
To expose pin 0, 4 and 7, use the bitmask of
10010001 converted to the hexadecimal value 0x0091.
.It Va hint.gpio.%d.pinon
This is a bitmask of pins on the GPIO board that will be set to ON at host
start.
To set pin 2, 5 and 13 to be set ON at boot, use the bitmask of
10000000010010 converted to the hexadecimal value 0x2012.
.It Va hint.gpio.function_set
.It Va hint.gpio.function_clear
These are bitmasks of pins that will remap a pin to handle a specific
function (USB, UART TX/RX, etc) in the Atheros function registers.
This is mainly used to set/clear functions that we need when they are set up or
not set up by uBoot.
.El
.Pp
Simply put, each pin of the GPIO interface is connected to an input/output
of some device in a system.
