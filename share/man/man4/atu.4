.Sh NAME
.Nm atu
.Nd Atmel AT76C50x USB IEEE 802.11b wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "atu* at uhub? port ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for wireless network adapters based around
the Atmel AT76C503, AT76C503A, AT76C505, and AT76C505A USB chipsets and four
companion radio chipsets.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames,
though it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It IBSS mode
Also known as
.Em IEEE ad-hoc
mode or
.Em peer-to-peer
mode.
This is the standardized method of operating without an access point.
Stations associate with a service set.
However, actual connections between stations are peer-to-peer.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use hardware
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The adapter needs some firmware files, which are loaded on demand by the
driver when the device is attached:

.Dl # ifconfig atu0 scan
.Pp
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example configures atu0 to join network
.Dq mynwid ,
using WEP key
.Dq mywepkey ,
obtaining an IP address using DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset indent

.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Daan Vreeken
and ported to
.Ox
by
.An Theo de Raadt
and
.An David Gwynne .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver does not support a lot of the functionality available in the hardware.
More work is required to properly support the IBSS, power management,
and selectable transmission rate features.
