.Sh NAME
.Nm gpioiic
.Nd GPIO I2C controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gpioiic* at gpio? offset 0 mask 0x3 flag 0x0"
.Cd "gpioiic* at gpio?"
.Cd "iic* at gpioiic?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver allows bit-banging an I2C bus as a master using two GPIO pins.
By default the first pin is used as a serial data (SDA) signal and the
second as a serial clock (SCL).
If the flag locator is set to 0x01, the order of the SDA and SCL signals
is reversed.
Both GPIO pins must be able to drive an output and the SDA pin must be
also able to read an input.
.Pp
The pins can be specified in the kernel configuration with the
.Ar offset
and the
.Ar mask
locators.
The
.Ar offset
and
.Ar mask
can also be specified when
.Nm
is attached at runtime using the
.Dv GPIOATTACH
.Xr ioctl 2
on the
.Xr gpio 4
device.
Each bit in the
.Ar mask
locator defines one pin; the pin number is calculated as an addition of
the bit position and the
.Ar offset
locator.
For example,
.Ar offset 17
and
.Ar mask 0x5
defines pin numbers 17 and 19.
