.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver attaches to USB modems, serial ports, and other devices that need
to look like a tty.
The
.Nm
driver behaves like a
.Xr tty 4 :
this means that normal programs such as
.Xr cu 1
or
.Xr pppd 8
can be used to access the device.
.Pp
The
.Va portno
locator can be used to decide which port to use for devices that have
multiple external ports.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 2.7 .
