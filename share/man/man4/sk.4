.Pp
The SysKonnect based adapters consist of two main components: the
XaQti Corp.\&
XMAC II Gigabit MAC (sk) and the SysKonnect GEnesis controller ASIC (skc).
The XMAC provides the Gigabit MAC and PHY support
while the GEnesis provides an interface to the PCI bus, DMA support,
packet buffering and arbitration.
The GEnesis can control up to two XMACs simultaneously,
allowing dual-port NIC configurations.
.Pp
The Marvell based adapters are a single integrated circuit, but are
still presented as a separate MAC (sk) and controller ASIC (skc).
.Pp
The GEnesis and Yukon 88E8001, 88E8003 and 88E8010 also support
jumbo frames.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width 1000baseSX
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It Cm 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseT
Set 1000baseT (Gigabit Ethernet) operation over twisted pair.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-duplex
modes are supported.
.It Cm 1000baseSX
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-duplex
modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
