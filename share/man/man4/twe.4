.Sh NAME
.Nm twe
.Nd 3ware 5000/6000/7000/8000 series PATA/SATA RAID controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "twe* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for AMCC's 3ware 5000/6000/7000/8000 series PATA/SATA
RAID adapters.
These adapters were formerly known as
.Dq 3ware Escalade .
.Pp
These controllers support 2, 4, 8, or 12 ATA disk drives and provide RAID 0,
RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 10, and JBOD configurations.
All the RAID set volume management is done via the card's BIOS.
.Pp
Even though the card uses ATA drives, this driver makes drives
and/or RAID sets appear as
.Xr sd 4 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following AMCC 3ware PATA/SATA RAID adapters:

.Tn 6000 series ,
.Tn 7000-2 ,
.Tn 7006-2 ,
.Tn 7500-4LP ,

.Sh BUGS
The card's BIOS seems to conflict with some other disk controllers
which have their own BIOS, if such devices are configured earlier
than this one.
To avoid this situation, place
.Nm
cards in the lowest numbered slot before other SCSI or RAID disk controllers.
.Pp
The current 3ware firmware is known to fail if a redundant configuration
is selected (RAID1 or RAID10) and the array is heavily used
(e.g. installation) before the controller has finished initializing the array.
In this case, create the array, boot the installation media, and
leave the array idle until all controller activity has ceased.
.Pp
None of the volume management or monitoring functions provided by the
card's firmware are supported due to the fact that information
on these functions is not public.
