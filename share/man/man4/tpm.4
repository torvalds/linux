.Sh NAME
.Nm tpm
.Nd Trusted Platform Module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device tpm"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tpm_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
In
.Pa /boot/device.hints :
.Cd hint.tpm.0.at="isa"
.Cd hint.tpm.0.maddr="0xfed40000"
.Cd hint.tpm.0.msize="0x5000"
.Cd hint.tpm.1.at="isa"
.Cd hint.tpm.1.maddr="0xfed40000"
.Cd hint.tpm.1.msize="0x1000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for various trusted platform modules (TPM) that can
store cryptographic keys.
.Pp
Supported modules:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
Atmel 97SC3203
.It
Broadcom BCM0102

Infineon IFX SLD 9630 TT 1.1 and IFX SLB 9635 TT 1.2
.It
Intel INTC0102
.It
Sinosun SNS SSX35
.It
STM ST19WP18
.It
Winbond WEC WPCT200
.El
.Pp
The driver can be configured to use an IRQ by providing a free ISA
interrupt vector in
.Pa /boot/device.hints .
