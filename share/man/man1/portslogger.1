.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm portslogger
.Op Fl s
.Ar directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
saves logs from ports build in separate files.
.Pp
.Nm
handles directory change messages from the ports tree infrastructure and
switches to a corresponding log file situated in

.Pa directory/screen-4.0.3p1.log .
.Nm
will filter progress-bar noise from
.Xr ftp 1 ,
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
and
.Xr pkg_create 1 .
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
acts as a filter and still passes its input to stdout, unless
run with
.Fl s .
.Pp
It is most often used as
.Pp
.Dl $ make package 2>&1 | portslogger logdir
.Pp
or in conjunction with
.Xr tmux 1 ,
such as
.Pp
.Dl $ tmux pipe-pane 'portslogger -s logdir'
