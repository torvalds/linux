.Sh NAME
.Nm portlock
.Nd lock port for concurrent builds
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Ar lockname Op comment ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
creates a lock named
.Ar lockname
using
.Xr open 2 .
If the lock is already held, it will display one single wait message on
stderr, sleep and retry until satisfaction.
.Pp
If necessary, creates the lock directory, using
.Fl m Ar mode
as a mode argument or the default if that option is not specified,
and
.Fl g Ar group
as the group owner if that option is specified.
.Pp
This implements a locking mechanism for ports building, see
.Sq LOCK INFRASTRUCTURE
in
.Xr ports 7
for details.
See also
.Xr dpb 1
for a complementary lock infrastructure when using dpb.
