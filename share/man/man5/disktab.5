.Sh NAME
.Nm disktab
.Nd disk description file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In disklabel.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Disktab
is a simple database which describes disk geometries and
disk partition characteristics.
It is used
.\"by the formatter(\c
.\"IR.Xr format 8 )
.\"to determine how to format the disk, and
to initialize the disk label on the disk.
The format is patterned
after the
.Xr termcap 5
terminal data base.
Entries in
.Nm
consist of a number of `:'-separated fields.
The
first field for each entry gives the names by which a
disk's entry may be selected, separated by `|' characters.
The
last name given should be a long name fully identifying
the disk.
.Pp
The optional fields for each entry are:
