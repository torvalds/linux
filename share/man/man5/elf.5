.Nd format of ELF executable binary files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In elf.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The header file
.In elf.h
defines the format of ELF executable binary files.
Amongst these files are
normal executable files, relocatable object files, core files and shared
libraries.
.Pp
An executable file using the ELF file format consists of an ELF header,
followed by a program header table or a section header table, or both.
The ELF header is always at offset zero of the file.
The program header
table and the section header table's offset in the file are defined in the
ELF header.
The two tables describe the rest of the particularities of
the file.
.Pp
Applications which wish to process ELF binary files for their native
architecture only should include
.In elf.h
in their source code.
These applications should need to refer to
all the types and structures by their generic names
.Dq Elf_xxx
and to the macros by
.Dq ELF_xxx .
Applications written this way can be compiled on any architecture,
regardless whether the host is 32-bit or 64-bit.
.Pp
Should an application need to process ELF files of an unknown
architecture then the application needs to include both
.In sys/elf32.h
and
.In sys/elf64.h
instead of
.In elf.h .
Furthermore, all types and structures need to be identified by either
.Dq Elf32_xxx
or
.Dq Elf64_xxx .
The macros need to be identified by
.Dq ELF32_xxx
or
.Dq ELF64_xxx .
.Pp
Whatever the system's architecture is, it will always include
.In sys/elf_common.h
as well as
.In sys/elf_generic.h .
.Pp
These header files describe the above mentioned headers as C structures
and also include structures for dynamic sections, relocation sections and
symbol tables.
.Pp
The following types are being used for 32-bit architectures:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Elf32_Addr	Unsigned 32-bit program address
Elf32_Half	Unsigned 16-bit field
Elf32_Lword	Unsigned 64-bit field
Elf32_Off	Unsigned 32-bit file offset
Elf32_Sword	Signed 32-bit field or integer
Elf32_Word	Unsigned 32-bit field or integer
.Ed
.Pp
For 64-bit architectures we have the following types:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Elf64_Addr	Unsigned 64-bit program address
Elf64_Half	Unsigned 16-bit field
Elf64_Lword	Unsigned 64-bit field
Elf64_Off	Unsigned 64-bit file offset
Elf64_Sword	Signed 32-bit field
Elf64_Sxword	Signed 64-bit field or integer
Elf64_Word	Unsigned 32-bit field
Elf64_Xword	Unsigned 64-bit field or integer
.Ed
.Pp
All data structures that the file format defines follow the
.Dq natural
size and alignment guidelines for the relevant class.
If necessary,
data structures contain explicit padding to ensure 4-byte alignment
for 4-byte objects, to force structure sizes to a multiple of 4, etc.
.Pp
The ELF header is described by the type Elf32_Ehdr or Elf64_Ehdr:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
typedef struct {
        unsigned char   e_ident[EI_NIDENT];
        Elf32_Half      e_type;
        Elf32_Half      e_machine;
        Elf32_Word      e_version;
        Elf32_Addr      e_entry;
        Elf32_Off       e_phoff;
        Elf32_Off       e_shoff;
        Elf32_Word      e_flags;
        Elf32_Half      e_ehsize;
        Elf32_Half      e_phentsize;
        Elf32_Half      e_phnum;
        Elf32_Half      e_shentsize;
        Elf32_Half      e_shnum;
        Elf32_Half      e_shstrndx;
} Elf32_Ehdr;

table.
If the file is using extended program header numbering, then the
.Sy e_phnum
member will contain the value
.Dv PN_XNUM
and the actual number of program header table entries will be stored
in the
.Sy sh_info
member of the section header at index
.Dv SHN_UNDEF .
The product of
.Sy e_phentsize

header table's size in bytes.
If a file has no program header,
.Sy e_phnum
holds the value zero.
.It Dv e_shentsize
This member holds a sections header's size in bytes.
A section header is one
entry in the section header table; all entries are the same size.

If the file is using extended section numbering, then the
.Sy e_shnum
member will be zero and the actual section number will be stored in the
.Sy sh_size
member of the section header at index
.Dv SHN_UNDEF .
If a file has no section header table, both the
.Sy e_shnum
and the
.Sy e_shoff
fields of the ELF header will be zero.
The product of
.Sy e_shentsize
and the number of sections in the file gives the section header
table's size in bytes.
.It Dv e_shstrndx
This member holds the section header table index of the entry associated
with the section name string table.
If extended section numbering is being used, this field will hold the
value
.Sy SHN_XINDEX ,
and the actual section header table index will be present in the
.Sy sh_link
field of the section header entry at index
.Dv SHN_UNDEF .
If the file has no section name string
table, this member holds the value
.Sy SHN_UNDEF .
.El
.Pp
An executable or shared object file's program header table is an array of
structures, each describing a segment or other information the system needs
to prepare the program for execution.
An object file
.Em segment
contains one or more
.Em sections .
Program headers are meaningful only for executable and shared object files.
A file specifies its own program header size with the ELF header's
.Sy e_phentsize
and
.Sy e_phnum
members.
As with the Elf executable header, the program header
also has different versions depending on the architecture:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
typedef struct {
        Elf32_Word      p_type;
        Elf32_Off       p_offset;
        Elf32_Addr      p_vaddr;
        Elf32_Addr      p_paddr;

        Elf64_Xword     p_align;
} Elf64_Phdr;
.Ed
.Pp
The main difference between the 32-bit and the 64-bit program header lies
only in the location of a
.Sy p_flags
member in the total struct.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "p_offset" -compact -offset indent
.It Dv p_type
This member of the Phdr struct tells what kind of segment this array
element describes or how to interpret the array element's information.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "PT_DYNAMIC" -compact
.It Dv PT_NULL
The array element is unused and the other members' values are undefined.
This lets the program header have ignored entries.
.It Dv PT_LOAD
The array element specifies a loadable segment, described by
.Sy p_filesz
and
.Sy p_memsz .
The bytes from the file are mapped to the beginning of the memory
segment.
If the segment's memory size
.Pq Sy p_memsz
is larger than the file size
.Pq Sy p_filesz ,
the
.Dq extra
bytes are defined to hold the value 0 and to follow the segment's
initialized area.
The file size may not be larger than the memory size.
Loadable segment entries in the program header table appear in ascending
order, sorted on the
.Sy p_vaddr
member.
.It Dv PT_DYNAMIC
The array element specifies dynamic linking information.
.It Dv PT_INTERP
The array element specifies the location and size of a null-terminated
path name to invoke as an interpreter.
This segment type is meaningful
only for executable files (though it may occur for shared objects).
However
it may not occur more than once in a file.
If it is present it must precede
any loadable segment entry.
.It Dv PT_NOTE
The array element specifies the location and size for auxiliary information.
.It Dv PT_SHLIB
This segment type is reserved but has unspecified semantics.
Programs that
contain an array element of this type do not conform to the ABI.
.It Dv PT_PHDR
The array element, if present, specifies the location and size of the program
header table itself, both in the file and in the memory image of the program.
This segment type may not occur more than once in a file.
Moreover, it may
only occur if the program header table is part of the memory image of the
program.
If it is present it must precede any loadable segment entry.
.It Dv PT_LOPROC
This value up to and including
.Sy PT_HIPROC
are reserved for processor-specific semantics.
.It Dv PT_HIPROC
This value down to and including
.Sy PT_LOPROC
are reserved for processor-specific semantics.
.El
.Pp
.It Dv p_offset
This member holds the offset from the beginning of the file at which
the first byte of the segment resides.
.It Dv p_vaddr
This member holds the virtual address at which the first byte of the
segment resides in memory.
.It Dv p_paddr
On systems for which physical addressing is relevant, this member is
reserved for the segment's physical address.
Under
.Bx
this member is
not used and must be zero.
.It Dv p_filesz
This member holds the number of bytes in the file image of the segment.
It may be zero.
.It Dv p_memsz
This member holds the number of bytes in the memory image of the segment.
It may be zero.
.It Dv p_flags
This member holds flags relevant to the segment:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "PF_X" -compact
.It Dv PF_X
An executable segment.
.It Dv PF_W
A writable segment.
.It Dv PF_R
A readable segment.
.El
.Pp
A text segment commonly has the flags
.Sy PF_X
and
.Sy PF_R .
A data segment commonly has
.Sy PF_X ,
.Sy PF_W
and
.Sy PF_R .
.It Dv p_align
This member holds the value to which the segments are aligned in memory
and in the file.
Loadable process segments must have congruent values for
.Sy p_vaddr
and
.Sy p_offset ,
modulo the page size.
Values of zero and one mean no alignment is required.
Otherwise,
.Sy p_align
should be a positive, integral power of two, and
.Sy p_vaddr
should equal
.Sy p_offset ,
modulo
.Sy p_align .
.El
.Pp
An file's section header table lets one locate all the file's sections.
The
section header table is an array of Elf32_Shdr or Elf64_Shdr structures.
The
ELF header's
.Sy e_shoff
member gives the byte offset from the beginning of the file to the section
header table.
.Sy e_shnum
holds the number of entries the section header table contains.
.Sy e_shentsize
holds the size in bytes of each entry.
.Pp
A section header table index is a subscript into this array.
Some section
header table indices are reserved.
An object file does not have sections for
these special indices:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "SHN_LORESERVE" -compact
.It Dv SHN_UNDEF
This value marks an undefined, missing, irrelevant, or otherwise meaningless
section reference.
For example, a symbol
.Dq defined
relative to section number
.Sy SHN_UNDEF
is an undefined symbol.
.It Dv SHN_LORESERVE
This value specifies the lower bound of the range of reserved indices.
.It Dv SHN_LOPROC
This value up to and including
.Sy SHN_HIPROC
are reserved for processor-specific semantics.
.It Dv SHN_HIPROC
This value down to and including
.Sy SHN_LOPROC
are reserved for processor-specific semantics.
.It Dv SHN_ABS
This value specifies absolute values for the corresponding reference.
For
example, symbols defined relative to section number
.Sy SHN_ABS
have absolute values and are not affected by relocation.
.It Dv SHN_COMMON
Symbols defined relative to this section are common symbols, such as FORTRAN
COMMON or unallocated C external variables.
.It Dv SHN_HIRESERVE
This value specifies the upper bound of the range of reserved indices.
The
system reserves indices between
.Sy SHN_LORESERVE
and
.Sy SHN_HIRESERVE ,
inclusive.
The section header table does not contain entries for the
reserved indices.
.El
.Pp
The section header has the following structure:

.Ed
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "sh_addralign" -compact
.It Dv sh_name
This member specifies the name of the section.
Its value is an index
into the section header string table section, giving the location of
a null-terminated string.
.It Dv sh_type
This member categorizes the section's contents and semantics.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "SHT_PROGBITS" -compact
.It Dv SHT_NULL
This value marks the section header as inactive.
It does not
have an associated section.
Other members of the section header
have undefined values.
.It Dv SHT_PROGBITS
The section holds information defined by the program, whose
format and meaning are determined solely by the program.
.It Dv SHT_SYMTAB
This section holds a symbol table.
Typically,
.Sy SHT_SYMTAB
provides symbols for link editing, though it may also be used
for dynamic linking.
As a complete symbol table, it may contain
many symbols unnecessary for dynamic linking.
An object file can
also contain a
.Sy SHN_DYNSYM
section.
.It Dv SHT_STRTAB
This section holds a string table.
An object file may have multiple
string table sections.
.It Dv SHT_RELA
This section holds relocation entries with explicit addends, such
as type
.Sy Elf32_Rela
for the 32-bit class of object files.
An object may have multiple
relocation sections.
.It Dv SHT_HASH
This section holds a symbol hash table.
All object participating in
dynamic linking must contain a symbol hash table.
An object file may
have only one hash table.
.It Dv SHT_DYNAMIC
This section holds information for dynamic linking.
An object file may
have only one dynamic section.
.It Dv SHT_NOTE
This section holds information that marks the file in some way.
.It Dv SHT_NOBITS
A section of this type occupies no space in the file but otherwise
resembles
.Sy SHN_PROGBITS .
Although this section contains no bytes, the
.Sy sh_offset
member contains the conceptual file offset.
.It Dv SHT_REL
This section holds relocation offsets without explicit addends, such
as type
.Sy Elf32_Rel
for the 32-bit class of object files.
An object file may have multiple
relocation sections.
.It Dv SHT_SHLIB
This section is reserved but has unspecified semantics.
.It Dv SHT_DYNSYM
This section holds a minimal set of dynamic linking symbols.
An
object file can also contain a

.Sy SHT_HIPROC
are reserved for processor-specific semantics.
.It Dv SHT_HIPROC
This value down to and including
.Sy SHT_LOPROC
are reserved for processor-specific semantics.
.It Dv SHT_LOUSER
This value specifies the lower bound of the range of indices reserved for
application programs.
.It Dv SHT_HIUSER
This value specifies the upper bound of the range of indices reserved for
application programs.
Section types between
.Sy SHT_LOUSER
and
.Sy SHT_HIUSER
may be used by the application, without conflicting with current or future
system-defined section types.
.El
.Pp
.It Dv sh_flags
Sections support one-bit flags that describe miscellaneous attributes.
If a flag bit is set in
.Sy sh_flags ,
the attribute is
.Dq on
for the section.
Otherwise, the attribute is
.Dq off
or does not apply.
Undefined attributes are set to zero.

.It Dv SHF_WRITE
This section contains data that should be writable during process
execution.
.It Dv SHF_ALLOC
The section occupies memory during process execution.
Some control
sections do not reside in the memory image of an object file.
This
attribute is off for those sections.
.It Dv SHF_EXECINSTR
The section contains executable machine instructions.
.It Dv SHF_MASKPROC
All bits included in this mask are reserved for processor-specific
semantics.
.El
.Pp
.It Dv sh_addr
If the section will appear in the memory image of a process, this member
holds the address at which the section's first byte should reside.
Otherwise, the member contains zero.
.It Dv sh_offset
This member's value holds the byte offset from the beginning of the file
to the first byte in the section.
One section type,
.Sy SHT_NOBITS ,
occupies no space in the file, and its
.Sy sh_offset
member locates the conceptual placement in the file.
.It Dv sh_size
This member holds the section's size in bytes.
Unless the section type
is
.Sy SHT_NOBITS ,
the section occupies
.Sy sh_size
bytes in the file.
A section of type
.Sy SHT_NOBITS
may have a non-zero size, but it occupies no space in the file.
.It Dv sh_link
This member holds a section header table index link, whose interpretation
depends on the section type.
.It Dv sh_info
This member holds extra information, whose interpretation depends on the
section type.
.It Dv sh_addralign
Some sections have address alignment constraints.
If a section holds a
doubleword, the system must ensure doubleword alignment for the entire
section.
That is, the value of
.Sy sh_addr
must be congruent to zero, modulo the value of
.Sy sh_addralign .
Only zero and positive integral powers of two are allowed.
Values of zero
or one mean the section has no alignment constraints.
.It Dv sh_entsize
Some sections hold a table of fixed-sized entries, such as a symbol table.
For such a section, this member gives the size in bytes for each entry.
This member contains zero if the section does not hold a table of
fixed-size entries.

String table sections hold null-terminated character sequences, commonly
called strings.
The object file uses these strings to represent symbol
and section names.
One references a string as an index into the string
table section.
The first byte, which is index zero, is defined to hold
a null character.
Similarly, a string table's last byte is defined to
hold a null character, ensuring null termination for all strings.
.Pp
An object file's symbol table holds information needed to locate and
relocate a program's symbolic definitions and references.
A symbol table
index is a subscript into this array.

.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "st_value" -compact
.It Dv st_name
This member holds an index into the object file's symbol string table,
which holds character representations of the symbol names.
If the value
is non-zero, it represents a string table index that gives the symbol
name.
Otherwise, the symbol table has no name.
.It Dv st_value
This member gives the value of the associated symbol.
.It Dv st_size
Many symbols have associated sizes.
This member holds zero if the symbol
has no size or an unknown size.
.It Dv st_info
This member specifies the symbol's type and binding attributes:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "STT_SECTION" -compact
.It Dv STT_NOTYPE
The symbol's type is not defined.
.It Dv STT_OBJECT
The symbol is associated with a data object.
.It Dv STT_FUNC
The symbol is associated with a function or other executable code.

The symbol is associated with a section.
Symbol table entries of
this type exist primarily for relocation and normally have
.Sy STB_LOCAL
bindings.
.It Dv STT_FILE
By convention the symbol's name gives the name of the source file
associated with the object file.
A file symbol has
.Sy STB_LOCAL
bindings, its section index is
.Sy SHN_ABS ,
and it precedes the other
.Sy STB_LOCAL
symbols of the file, if it is present.

definition.
Local symbols of the same name may exist in multiple file
without interfering with each other.
.It Dv STB_GLOBAL
Global symbols are visible to all object files being combined.
One file's
definition of a global symbol will satisfy another file's undefined
reference to the same symbol.
.It Dv STB_WEAK
Weak symbols resemble global symbols, but their definitions have lower
precedence.
.It Dv STB_LOPROC

Relocation is the process of connecting symbolic references with
symbolic definitions.
Relocatable files must have information that
describes how to modify their section contents, thus allowing executable
and shared object files to hold the right information for a process'
program image.
Relocation entries are these data.

.Ed
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "r_offset" -compact
.It Dv r_offset
This member gives the location at which to apply the relocation action.
For a relocatable file, the value is the byte offset from the beginning
of the section to the storage unit affected by the relocation.
For an
executable file or shared object, the value is the virtual address of
the storage unit affected by the relocation.
.It Dv r_info
This member gives both the symbol table index with respect to which the
relocation must be made and the type of relocation to apply.
Relocation
types are processor-specific.
When the text refers to a relocation
entry's relocation type or symbol table index, it means the result of
applying
.Sy ELF_[32|64]_R_TYPE
or
.Sy ELF[32|64]_R_SYM ,
respectively to the entry's
.Sy r_info
member.
.It Dv r_addend
This member specifies a constant addend used to compute the value to be
stored into the relocatable field.
