.Sh NAME
.Nm freebsd-update.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr freebsd-update 8
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file controls the behaviour of the
.Xr freebsd-update 8
utility.
The file contains lines consisting of a case-sensitive option name and
zero or more parameters.
Empty lines and any part of a line following a
.Ql #
character are ignored.
Unless stated otherwise, specifying an option multiple times is an
error.
.Pp
The possible options and their meanings are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm BackupKernelSymbolFiles"
.It Cm KeyPrint
The single parameter following this keyword is the SHA256 hash
of the RSA key which will be trusted to sign updates.
.It Cm ServerName
The single parameter following this keyword is the name of the
server or server pool from which updates will be downloaded.
.It Cm Components
The parameters following this keyword are the components or
sub-components of
.Fx
which will be updated.
The components are
.Dq src
(source code),
.Dq world
(non-kernel binaries), and
.Dq kernel ;
the sub-components are the individual distribution sets generated as
part of the release process (e.g.,
.Dq src/base ,
.Dq src/sys ,
.Dq world/base ,
.Dq world/catpages ,
.Dq kernel/smp ) .
Note that prior to
.Fx 6.1 ,
the
.Dq kernel
component was distributed as part of
.Dq world/base .
.Pp
This option can be specified multiple times, and the parameters
accumulate.
.It Cm IgnorePaths
The parameters following this keyword are regular expressions;
updates to paths which start with a string matching one of
these regular expressions will be ignored.
.Pp
This option can be specified multiple times, and the parameters
accumulate.
.It Cm IDSIgnorePaths
The parameters following this keyword are regular expressions;
paths which start with a string matching one of these regular
expressions will be ignored by "freebsd-update IDS".
.Pp
This option can be specified multiple times, and the parameters
accumulate.
.It Cm UpdateIfUnmodified
The parameters following this keyword are regular expressions;
updates to paths which start with a string matching one of
these regular expressions will be ignored if the files have
been modified locally (unless they are merged -- see MergeChanges
below).
.Pp
This option can be specified multiple times, and the parameters
accumulate.
.It Cm MergeChanges
The parameters following this keyword are regular expressions;
updates to paths which start with a string matching one of
these regular expressions will be merged with local modifications.
.Pp
This option can be specified multiple times, and the parameters
accumulate.
.It Cm WorkDir
The single parameter following this keyword is the directory
in which temporary files and downloaded updates will be stored.
.It Cm MailTo
The single parameter following this keyword is the address
to which
.Cm cron
output will be mailed.
.It Cm AllowAdd
The single parameter following this keyword must be
.Dq yes
or
.Dq no
and specifies whether
.Cm freebsd-update
is allowed to create new files, directories, and symlinks if
these are part of updates downloaded.
Note that
.Cm freebsd-update
will not re-add files which have been deleted from a
.Fx
installation unless those files were previously added as part
of an update.
.It Cm AllowDelete
The single parameter following this keyword must be
.Dq yes
or
.Dq no
and specifies whether
.Cm freebsd-update
is allowed to delete files, directories, and symlinks as
part of updates downloaded.
.It Cm KeepModifiedMetadata
The single parameter following this keyword must be
.Dq yes
or
.Dq no
and specifies whether
.Cm freebsd-update
should keep existing file ownership, permissions, and flags
when installing updates if these have been modified locally.
.It Cm StrictComponents
The single parameter following this keyword must be
.Dq yes
or
.Dq no
and specifies whether
.Cm freebsd-update
should interpret the list of components of
.Fx
specified via the
.Cm Components
option strictly as a list of components installed which
should be upgraded when the
.Cm upgrade
command is used ("yes"), or merely as a list of components
which might be installed, of which
.Cm freebsd-update
should identify which in fact are present ("no").
.It Cm BackupKernel
The single parameter following this keyword must be
.Dq yes
or
.Dq no
and specifies whether
.Cm freebsd-update
will create a backup of the old kernel before installing a new kernel.
This backup kernel can be used to recover a system where the newly
installed kernel somehow did not work.
Note that the backup kernel is not reverted to its original state by
the
.Cm freebsd-update
rollback command.
.It Cm BackupKernelDir
This keyword sets the directory which is used to store a backup
kernel, if the BackupKernel feature is enabled.
If the directory already exist, and it was not created by
.Cm freebsd-update ,
the directory is skipped.
In the case of the primary directory name not being usable, a number
starting with
.Sq 1
is appended to the directory name.
Like with the primary directory name, the constructed directory name is
only used if the path name does not exist, or if the directory was
previously created by
.Cm freebsd-update .
If the constructed directory still exist the appended number is
incremented with 1 and the directory search process restarted.
Should the number increment go above 9,
.Cm freebsd-update
will abort.
.It Cm BackupKernelSymbolFiles
The single parameter following this keyword must be
.Dq yes
or
.Dq no
and specifies whether
.Cm freebsd-update
will also backup kernel symbol files, if they exist.
The kernel symbol files takes up a lot of disk space and are not
needed for recovery purposes.
If the symbol files are needed, after recovering a system using the
backup kernel, the
.Cm freebsd-update
rollback command will recreate the symbol files along with the old
kernel.
