.Sh NAME
.Nm msdosfs
.Nd MS-DOS file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options MSDOSFS"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver will permit the
.Fx
kernel to read and write MS-DOS based file systems.
.Pp
The most common usage follows:
.Pp
.Dl "mount -t msdosfs /dev/ada0sN /mnt"
.Pp
where
.Ar N
is the partition number and
.Pa /mnt
is a mount point.
Some users tend to create a
.Pa /dos
directory for
.Nm
mount points.
This helps to keep better track of the file system,
and make it more easily accessible.
.Pp
It is possible to define an entry in
.Pa /etc/fstab
that looks similar to:
.Bd -literal
/dev/ada0sN		/dos	msdosfs		rw	0	0
.Ed
.Pp
This will mount an MS-DOS based partition at the
.Pa /dos
mount point during system boot.
Using
.Pa /mnt
as a permanent mount point is not advised as its intention
has always been to be a temporary mount point for floppy and
ZIP disks.
See
.Xr hier 7
for more information on
.Fx
directory layout.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Determine which FAT file system version (e.g, FAT16, FAT32)
is a partition formatted with:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
file -s /dev/da0s1
.Ed
.Pp
.Xr gpart 8
may also be used to extract this information.
