.Sh NAME
.Nm acct
.Nd execution accounting file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acct.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The kernel maintains the following
.Fa acct
information structure for all
processes.
If a process terminates, and accounting is enabled,
the kernel calls the
.Xr acct 2
function call to prepare and append the record
to the accounting file.
.Bd -literal
#define AC_COMM_LEN 16

/*
 * Accounting structure version 3 (current).
 * The first byte is always zero.
 * Time units are microseconds.
 */

struct acctv3 {
	uint8_t  ac_zero;		/* zero identifies new version */
	uint8_t  ac_version;		/* record version number */
	uint16_t ac_len;		/* record length */

	char	  ac_comm[AC_COMM_LEN];	/* command name */

.Ed
.Pp
If a terminated process was created by an
.Xr execve 2 ,
the name of the executed file (at most ten characters of it)
is saved in the field
.Fa ac_comm
and its status is saved by setting one of more of the following flags in
.Fa ac_flag :
.Dv AFORK ,
.Dv ACOMPAT ,
.Dv ACORE
and
.Dv ASIG .
.Dv ASU
is no longer supported.
.Dv ANVER
is always set in the above structure.

.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
file format appeared in
.At v7 .
The current record format was introduced on May 2007.
It is backwards compatible with the previous format,
which is still documented in
.In sys/acct.h
and supported by
.Xr lastcomm 1
and
.Xr sa 8 .
