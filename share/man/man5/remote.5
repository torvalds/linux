.Sh NAME
.Nm remote
.Nd remote host description file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file describes remote hosts known by
.Xr cu 1 .
It is an ASCII file structured somewhat like the
.Xr termcap 5
file.
Each line in the file provides a description for a single remote host.
Fields are separated by a colon
.Pq Sq \&: .
Lines ending with a
.Sq \e
character immediately followed by a newline are continued on the next line.
.Pp
The first entry is the name(s) of the host system.
If there is more than one name for a system, the names are separated by
vertical bars
.Pq Sq \&| .
After the name of the system comes the fields of the description (the
capabilities).
.Pp
Capabilities are either strings (str), numbers (num), or boolean flags (bool).
A string capability is specified by
.Em capability Ns Ar = Ns Em value ;
for example,
.Sq dv=/dev/harris .
A numeric capability is specified by
.Em capability Ns Ar # Ns Em value ;
for example,
.Sq br#19200 .
A boolean capability is specified by simply listing the capability.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy \&br
(num)
The baud rate used in establishing
a connection to the remote host.
This is a decimal number.
The default baud rate is 9600 baud.
.It Sy \&dc
(bool)
This host is directly connected, and
.Xr cu 1
should not expect carrier detect to be high, nor should it exit if
carrier detect drops.
.It Sy \&dv
(str)
Device to open to establish a connection.
If this file refers to a terminal line,
.Xr cu 1
attempts to perform an exclusive open on the device to ensure only
one user at a time has access to the port.
