.Sh NAME
.Nm fstab
.Nd static information about the filesystems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In fstab.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains descriptive information about the various file systems.
.Nm
is only read by programs, and not written;
it is the duty of the system administrator to properly create
and maintain this file.
Each filesystem is described on a separate line;
fields on each line are separated by tabs or spaces.
Lines beginning with the
.Sq #
character are comments and are ignored.
The order of records in
.Nm
is important because
.Xr fsck 8
and
.Xr mount 8
sequentially iterate through
.Nm
doing their thing.
.Pp
A line has the following format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
fs_spec fs_file fs_vfstype fs_mntops fs_freq fs_passno
.Ed
.Pp
The first field,
.Fa fs_spec ,
describes the block special device or remote filesystem to be mounted.
A block special device may be specified by pathname
or by
.Xr disklabel 8
UID (DUID).
For filesystems of type MFS
the special file name is typically that of the primary swap area;
if the keyword
.Dq swap
is used instead of a special file name,
default configuration parameters are used.
If a program needs the character special file name,
the program must create it by appending an
.Sq r
after the last
.Sq /
in the special file name.
.Pp
The second field,
.Fa fs_file ,
describes the mount point for the filesystem.
For swap partitions, this field should be specified as
.Dq none .
.Pp
The third field,
.Fa fs_vfstype ,
describes the type of the filesystem.
The system currently supports the following types of filesystems:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -offset indent -compact
.It cd9660
An ISO 9660 CD-ROM filesystem.
.It ext2fs
A local Linux compatible ext2fs
filesystem.
.It ffs
A local
.Ux
filesystem.
.It mfs
A local memory-based
.Ux
filesystem.
.It msdos
An
.Tn MS-DOS
FAT filesystem.
.It nfs
A Sun Microsystems compatible Network File System.
.It ntfs
An NTFS filesystem.
.It swap
A disk partition to be used for swapping.
.It tmpfs
A local memory-based
.Ux
filesystem.
.It udf
A UDF filesystem.
.It vnd
A VND image file.
.El
.Pp
The fourth field,
.Fa fs_mntops ,
describes the mount options associated with the filesystem.
It is formatted as a comma separated list of options.
It contains at least the type of mount (see
.Fa fs_type
below) plus any additional options appropriate to the filesystem type.
.Pp
The option
.Dq auto
can be used in the
.Dq noauto
form to cause
a file system not to be mounted automatically (with
.Ic mount -A
or
.Ic mount -a ,
or at system boot time).
Similarly, the option
.Dq net
can be used to cause a file system to be considered only if the
.Fl N
flag is passed to
.Xr mount 8
or
.Xr fsck 8 .
.Pp
If the options
.Dq userquota
and/or
.Dq groupquota
are specified, the filesystem is automatically processed by the
.Xr quotacheck 8
command, and user and/or group disk quotas are enabled with
.Xr quotaon 8 .
By default, filesystem quotas are maintained in files named
.Pa quota.user
and
.Pa quota.group
which are located at the root of the associated filesystem.
These defaults may be overridden by putting an equal sign
and an alternative absolute pathname following the quota option.
Thus, if the user quota file for
.Pa /tmp
is stored in
.Pa /var/quotas/tmp.user ,
this location can be specified as:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
userquota=/var/quotas/tmp.user
.Ed
.Pp
The type of the mount is extracted from the first parameter of the
.Fa fs_mntops
field and stored separately in the
.Fa fs_type
field (it is not deleted from the
.Fa fs_mntops
field).
If
.Fa fs_type
is
.Dq rw ,
.Dq rq ,
or
.Dq ro
then the filesystem whose name is given in the
.Fa fs_file
field is normally mounted read-write or read-only on the
specified special file.
If
.Fa fs_type
is
.Dq sw
then the special file is made available as a piece of swap space by the
.Xr swapon 8
command at the end of the system reboot procedure.
The fields other than
.Fa fs_spec
and
.Fa fs_type
are unused.
If
.Fa fs_type
is specified as
.Dq xx ,
the entry is ignored.
This is useful to show disk partitions which are currently unused.
.Pp
The fifth field,
.Fa fs_freq ,
is used by the
.Fl W
and
.Fl w
options of
.Xr dump 8
to recommend which filesystems should be backed up.
The value specifies the number of days
after which a dump is regarded as being old;
if it is not present, a value of zero is returned and
.Xr dump 8
will assume that the filesystem does not need to be dumped.
.Pp
The sixth field,
.Fa fs_passno ,
is used by the
.Xr fsck 8
program to determine the order in which filesystem checks are done
at reboot time.
The root filesystem should be specified with a
.Fa fs_passno
of 1, and other filesystems should have a
.Fa fs_passno
of 2.
Filesystems within a drive will be checked sequentially,
but filesystems on different drives will be checked at the
same time to utilize parallelism available in the hardware.
If the sixth field is not present or is zero,
a value of zero is returned and
.Xr fsck 8
will assume that the filesystem does not need to be checked.

.Pp
The proper way to read records from
.Pa fstab
is to use the routines
.Xr getfsent 3 ,
.Xr getfsspec 3 ,
and
.Xr getfsfile 3 .
