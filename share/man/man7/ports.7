.Nm ports
.Nd contributed applications
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fx
Ports Collection
offers a simple way to compile and install third party applications.
It is also used to build packages, to be installed using
.Xr pkg 8 .
.Pp
The ports tree, typically located at
.Pa /usr/ports ,
consists of subdirectories, one for each category; those in turn contain
individual ports.
Each port is a directory with metadata and patches necessary to make
the original application source code compile and run on
.Fx .
Compiling an application is as simple as typing
.Dq Li "make build"
in the port directory.
The
.Pa Makefile
automatically fetches the
application source code, either from a local disk or the network, unpacks it,
applies the patches, and compiles it.
It also recursively handles dependencies \(em other pieces of software
the port depends on in order to build and work.
Afterwards,
.Dq Li "make install"
installs the application.
.Pp
The
.Fx
Ports Collection is maintained in several branches, which differ mostly
by versions of software provided: the
.Em head
branch contains all the latest changes, while the
.Em quarterly
branches only provide critical fixes.
The
.Em head
branch can be installed or updated using either
.Xr portsnap 8 ,
or from Subversion repository at:
.Pp
.Lk https://svn.FreeBSD.org/ports/head
.Pp
The
.Em quarterly
branches can be found in Subversion in the
.Pa branches/
subdirectory, eg:
.Pp
.Lk https://svn.FreeBSD.org/ports/branches/2019Q1
.Pp
It is generally a good idea to use the
.Nm
branch that matches the
.Xr pkg 8
repository being used.
By default, for
.Fx CURRENT
the
.Xr pkg 8
is configured to install packages built from the
.Em head
branch, while for
.Fx STABLE
or RELEASE versions it is configured to install packages built from
the latest
.Em quarterly
branch.
Currently configured
.Xr pkg 8
repository can be verified by looking at the
.Em url
field in
.Cm pkg -vv
output.

.Sh TARGETS
Some of the
.Xr make 1
targets work recursively through subdirectories.
This lets you, for example, install all of the
.Dq Li biology
ports with one command.
The targets that do this are
.Cm build , checksum , clean , configure ,
.Cm depends , extract , fetch , install ,
and
.Cm package .
.Pp
The following targets will be run automatically by each proceeding
target in order.
That is,
.Cm build
will be run (if necessary) by
.Cm install ,
and so on all the way to
.Cm fetch .
Usually, you will only use the
.Cm install
target.
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm configure"
.It Cm config
Configure
.Va OPTIONS
for this port using
.Xr dialog4ports 1 .
.It Cm fetch
Fetch all of the files needed to build this port from the sites
listed in
.Va MASTER_SITES
and
.Va PATCH_SITES .
See
.Va FETCH_CMD , MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE
and
.Va MASTER_SITE_BACKUP .
.It Cm checksum
Verify that the fetched distfile's checksum matches the one the port was
tested against.
If the distfile's checksum does not match, it also fetches the distfiles
which are missing or failed the checksum calculation.
Defining
.Va NO_CHECKSUM
will skip this step.
.It Cm depends
Install
(or compile if only compilation is necessary)
any dependencies of the current port.
When called by the
.Cm extract
or
.Cm fetch
targets, this is run in piecemeal as
.Cm fetch-depends , build-depends ,
etc.
Defining
.Va NO_DEPENDS
will skip this step.
.It Cm extract
Expand the distfile into a work directory.
.It Cm patch
Apply any patches that are necessary for the port.
.It Cm configure
Configure the port.
Some ports will ask you questions during this stage.
See
.Va INTERACTIVE
and
.Va BATCH .
.It Cm build
Build the port.
This is the same as calling the
.Cm all
target.
.It Cm install
Install the port and register it with the package system.
This is all you really need to do.
.El
.Pp
The following targets are not run during the normal install process.
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm fetch-recursive"
.It Cm showconfig
Display
.Va OPTIONS
config for this port.
.It Cm showconfig-recursive
Display
.Va OPTIONS
config for this port and all its dependencies.
.It Cm rmconfig
Remove
.Va OPTIONS
config for this port.
.It Cm rmconfig-recursive
Remove
.Va OPTIONS
config for this port and all its dependencies.
.It Cm config-conditional
Skip the ports which have already had their
.Va OPTIONS
configured.
.It Cm config-recursive
Configure
.Va OPTIONS
for this port and all its dependencies using
.Xr dialog4ports 1 .
.It Cm fetch-list
Show list of files to be fetched in order to build the port.
.It Cm fetch-recursive
Fetch the distfiles of the port and all its dependencies.
.It Cm fetch-recursive-list
Show list of files that would be retrieved by
.Cm fetch-recursive .
.It Cm run-depends-list , build-depends-list
Print a list of all the compile and run dependencies, and dependencies
of those dependencies, by port directory.
.It Cm all-depends-list
Print a list of all dependencies for the port.
.It Cm pretty-print-run-depends-list , pretty-print-build-depends-list
Print a list of all the compile and run dependencies, and dependencies
of those dependencies, by port name and version.
.It Cm missing
Print a list of missing dependencies to be installed for the port.
.It Cm clean
Remove the expanded source code.
This recurses to dependencies unless
.Va NOCLEANDEPENDS
is defined.
.It Cm distclean
Remove the port's distfiles and perform the
.Cm clean
target.
The
.Cm clean
portion recurses to dependencies unless
.Va NOCLEANDEPENDS
is defined, but the
.Cm distclean
portion never recurses
(this is perhaps a bug).
.It Cm reinstall
Use this to restore a port after using
.Xr pkg-delete 8
when you should have used
.Cm deinstall .
.It Cm deinstall
Remove an installed port from the system, similar to
.Xr pkg-delete 8 .
.It Cm deinstall-all
Remove all installed ports with the same
.Va PKGORIGIN
from the system.
.It Cm package
Make a binary package for the port.
The port will be installed if it has not already been.
The package is a
.Pa .tbz
file that you can use to
install the port on other machines with
.Xr pkg-add 8 .
If the directory specified by
.Va PACKAGES
does not exist, the package will be put into the current directory.
See
.Va PKGREPOSITORY
and
.Va PKGFILE .
.It Cm package-recursive
Like
.Cm package ,
but makes a package for each depending port as well.
.It Cm package-name
Prints the name with version of the port.
.It Cm readmes
Create a port's
.Pa README.html .
This can be used from
.Pa /usr/ports
to create a browsable web of all ports on your system!
.It Cm search
Search the
.Pa INDEX
file for the pattern specified by the
.Va key
(searches the port name, comment, and dependencies),
.Va name
(searches the port name only),
.Va path
(searches the port path),
.Va info
(searches the port info),
.Va maint
(searches the port maintainer),
.Va cat
(searches the port category),
.Va bdeps
(searches the port build-time dependency),
.Va rdeps
(searches the port run-time dependency),
.Va www
(searches the port web site)
.Xr make 1
variables, and their exclusion counterparts:
.Va xname , xkey
etc.
For example, one would type:
.Pp
.Dl "cd /usr/ports && make search name=query"
.Pp
to find all ports whose
name matches
.Dq Li query .
Results include the matching ports' path, comment, maintainer,
build dependencies, and run dependencies.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/ports && make search name=pear- \e
    xbdeps=apache
.Ed
.Pp
To find all ports whose
names contain
.Dq Li pear-
and which do not have apache
listed in build-time dependencies.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/ports && make search name=pear- \e
    xname='ht(tp|ml)'
.Ed
.Pp
To find all ports whose names contain
.Dq Li pear- ,
but not
.Dq Li html
or
.Dq Li http .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
make search key=apache display=name,path,info keylim=1
.Ed
.Pp
To find ports that contain
.Dq Li apache
in either of the name, path, info
fields, ignore the rest of the record.
.Pp
By default the search is not case-sensitive.
In order to make it case-sensitive you can use the
.Va icase
variable:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
make search name=p5-R icase=0
.Ed
.It Cm quicksearch
Reduced
.Cm search
output.
Only display name, path and info.
.It Cm describe
Generate a one-line description of each port for use in the
.Pa INDEX
file.
.It Cm maintainer
Display the port maintainer's email address.
.It Cm index
Create
.Pa /usr/ports/INDEX ,
which is used by the
.Cm pretty-print-*
and
.Cm search
targets.
Running the
.Cm index
target will ensure your
.Pa INDEX
file is up to date with your ports tree.
.It Cm fetchindex
Fetch the
.Pa INDEX
file from the
.Fx
cluster.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
You can change all of these.
.Bl -tag -width ".Va MASTER_SITES"
.It Va PORTSDIR
Location of the ports tree.
This is
.Pa /usr/ports
on
.Fx
and

in
.Va PORTSDIR .
.It Va PACKAGES
Used only for the
.Cm package
target; the base directory for the packages tree, normally
.Pa packages/
in
.Va PORTSDIR .
If this directory exists, the package tree will be (partially) constructed.
This directory does not have to exist; if it does not, packages will be
placed into the current directory, or you can define one of
.Bl -tag -width ".Va PKGREPOSITORY"
.It Va PKGREPOSITORY
Directory to put the package in.
.It Va PKGFILE
The full path to the package.
.El
.It Va LOCALBASE

.Pa INDEX
source built on
.Fx
cluster (for
.Cm fetchindex
target).
Defaults to
.Pa https://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/ .
.It Va FETCHINDEX
Command to get
.Pa INDEX
(for
.Cm fetchindex
target).
Defaults to
.Dq Li "fetch -am" .
.It Va NOCLEANDEPENDS

.Cm clean
recurse to dependencies.
.It Va FETCH_CMD
Command to use to fetch files.
Normally
.Xr fetch 1 .
.It Va FORCE_PKG_REGISTER

.It Va DISABLE_VULNERABILITIES
If defined, disable check for security vulnerabilities using
.Xr pkg-audit 8
when installing new ports.
.It Va NO_IGNORE
If defined, allow installation of ports marked as
.Aq Va FORBIDDEN .
The default behavior of the Ports framework is to abort when the
installation of a forbidden port is attempted.
Of course, these ports may not work as expected, but if you really know
what you are doing and are sure about installing a forbidden port, then
.Va NO_IGNORE
lets you do it.
.It Va NO_CHECKSUM

.Va OPTIONS
are stored.
Defaults to
.Pa /var/db/ports .
Each port where
.Va OPTIONS
have been configured will have a uniquely named sub-directory, containing a
single file
.Pa options .
.El
.Sh MAKE VARIABLES
The following list provides a name and short description for many of the
variables that are used when building ports.
More information on these and other related variables may be found in
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/Mk/*
and the
.Fx
Porter's Handbook.
.Bl -tag -width "WITH_CCACHE_BUILD"

If set, enables the use of
.Xr ccache 1
for building ports.
.It Va CCACHE_DIR
Which directory to use for the
.Xr ccache 1
data.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk" -compact
.It Pa /usr/ports
The default ports directory.
.It Pa /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk
The big Kahuna.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width 0n
.It Sy Example 1\&: No Building and Installing a Port
.Pp
The following command builds and installs Emacs.
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Li # Ic cd /usr/ports/editors/emacs
.Li # Ic make install
.Ed
.It Sy Example 2\&: No Installing Dependencies with Xr pkg 8
.Pp
The following example shows how to build and install a port without having to
build its dependencies.
Instead, the dependencies are downloaded via
.Xr pkg 8 .
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Li # Ic make missing | xargs pkg install --automatic --yes
.Li # Ic make install
.Ed
.Pp
It is especially useful, when the dependencies are costly
in time and resources to build
.Pq like Pa lang/rust .
The drawback is that
.Xr pkg 8
offers only packages built with the default set of
.Va OPTIONS .
.It Sy Example 3\&: No Building a Non-Default Flavor of a Port
.Pp
The following command builds a non-default flavor of a port.
(In this case
.Pa devel/py-pip
is going to be built with Python 3.7 support.)
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Li # Ic cd /usr/ports/devel/py-pip
.Li # Ic env FLAVOR=py37 make build
