.Sh NAME
.Nm bus_generic_new_pass
.Nd "generic implementation of BUS_NEW_PASS for bus devices"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/bus.h
.Ft void
.Fn bus_generic_new_pass "device_t dev"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function provides an implementation of the
.Xr BUS_NEW_PASS 9
method which can be used by bus drivers.
It first invokes the
.Xr DEVICE_IDENTIFY 9
method for any drivers whose pass level is equal to the new pass level.
Then, for each attached child device it calls
.Xr BUS_NEW_PASS 9
to rescan child buses,
and for each unattached child device it calls
.Xr device_probe_and_attach 9 .
