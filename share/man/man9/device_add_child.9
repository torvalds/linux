.Dt DEVICE_ADD_CHILD 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm device_add_child ,
.Nm device_add_child_ordered
.Nd "add a new device as a child of an existing device"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/bus.h
.Ft device_t
.Fn device_add_child "device_t dev" "const char *name" "int unit"
.Ft device_t
.Fn device_add_child_ordered "device_t dev" "int order" "const char *name" "int unit"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Create a new child device of
.Fa dev .
The
.Fa name
and
.Fa unit
arguments specify the name and unit number of the device.
If the name is unknown then the caller should pass
.Dv NULL .
If the unit is unknown then the caller should pass
.Dv -1
and the system will choose the next available unit number.
.Pp
The name of the device is used to determine which drivers might be
appropriate for the device.
If a name is specified then only drivers of that name are probed.
If no name is given then all drivers for the owning bus are probed.
In any event, only the name of the device is stored so that one may
safely unload/load a driver bound to that name.
.Pp
This allows buses which can uniquely identify device instances (such
as PCI) to allow each driver to check each device instance for a
match.
For buses which rely on supplied probe hints where only one
driver can have a chance of probing the device, the driver name should
be specified as the device name.
.Pp
Normally unit numbers will be chosen automatically by the system and a
unit number of
.Dv -1
should be given.
When a specific unit number is desired (e.g.,\& for wiring a particular
piece of hardware to a pre-configured unit number), that unit should
be passed.
If the specified unit number is already allocated, a new
unit will be allocated and a diagnostic message printed.
.Pp
If the devices attached to a bus must be probed in a specific order
(e.g.,\& for the ISA bus some devices are sensitive to failed probe attempts
of unrelated drivers and therefore must be probed first),
the
.Fa order
argument of
.Fn device_add_child_ordered
should be used to specify a partial ordering.
The new device will be added before any existing device with a greater
order.
If
.Fn device_add_child
is used, then the new child will be added as if its order was zero.
.Pp
When adding a device in the context of
.Xr DEVICE_IDENTIFY 9
routine, the
.Xr device_find_child 9
routine should be used to ensure that the device has not already been
added to the tree.
Because the device name and
.Vt devclass_t
are associated at probe time (not child addition time), previous
instances of the driver (say in a module that was later unloaded) may
have already added the instance.
Authors of bus drivers must likewise be careful when adding children
when they are loaded and unloaded to avoid duplication of children
devices.
.Pp
When adding a child to another device node, such as in an identify
routine, use
.Xr BUS_ADD_CHILD 9
instead of
.Xr device_add_child 9 .
.Xr BUS_ADD_CHILD 9
will call
.Xr device_add_child 9
and add the proper bus-specific data to the new child.
.Fn device_add_child
does not call
.Xr BUS_ADD_CHILD 9 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The new device if successful, NULL otherwise.
