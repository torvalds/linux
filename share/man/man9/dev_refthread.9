.Dt DEV_REFTHREAD 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dev_refthread ,
.Nm devvn_refthread ,
.Nm dev_relthread
.Nd safely access device methods
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/conf.h
.Ft "struct cdevsw *"
.Fn dev_refthread "struct cdev *dev" "int *ref"
.Ft "struct cdevsw *"
.Fn devvn_refthread "struct vnode *vp" "struct cdev **devp" "int *ref"
.Ft void
.Fn dev_relthread "struct cdev *dev" "int ref"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn dev_refthread
(or
.Fn devvn_refthread )
and
.Fn dev_relthread
routines provide a safe way to access
.Xr devfs 5
devices that may be concurrently destroyed by
.Fn destroy_dev
(e.g., removable media).
.Pp
If successful,
.Fn dev_refthread
and
.Fn devvn_refthread
acquire a "thread reference" to the associated
.Vt "struct cdev"
and return a non-NULL pointer to the cdev's
.Vt "struct cdevsw"
method table.
For the duration of that reference, the cdev's associated private data and
method table object are valid.
Destruction of the cdev sleeps until the thread reference is released.
.Pp
A reference cannot prevent media removal.
It is an implementation detail of individual drivers how method calls from
callers with
.Fn dev_refthread
references are handled when the device is
pending destruction.
A common behavior for disk devices is to return the
.Er ENXIO
status, but that is not required by this KPI.
.Pp
The
.Fn devvn_refthread
variant of
.Fn dev_refthread
extracts the
.Vt "struct cdev"
pointer out of the
.Dv VCHR
.Xr vnode 9
automatically before performing the same actions as
.Fn dev_refthread .
Additionally, a pointer to the
.Vt "struct cdev"
is returned to the caller via
.Fa "*devp" .
.Fn devvn_refthread
correctly handles possible parallel reclamation of the vnode.
.Pp
.Fn dev_relthread
is used to release a reference to a
.Vt "struct cdev" .
.Fn dev_relthread
.Sy must
only be invoked when the associated invocation of
.Fn dev_refthread
or
.Fn devvn_refthread
returned a non-NULL
.Vt "struct cdevsw *" .
.Sh CONTEXT
.Vt struct cdev
objects have two reference counts,
.Va si_refcount
and
.Va si_threadcount .
The
.Fn dev_refthread ,
.Fn devvn_refthread ,
and
.Fn dev_relthread
functions manipulate the
.Va si_threadcount .
The
.Va si_threadcount
reference guarantees the liveness of the
.Vt struct cdev
object.
The other
.Va si_refcount
reference provides only the weaker guarantee that the memory backing the
.Vt struct cdev
has not been freed.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If
.Fn dev_refthread
or
.Fn devvn_refthread
are unsuccessful, they return
.Dv NULL .
.Bf Em
If these routines are unsuccessful, they do not increment the
.Vt "struct cdev"
.Va si_threadcount
and do not initialize the value pointed to by the
.Fa "*ref"
parameter in any way.
.Ef
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr destroy_dev 9 ,
.Xr devfs 5
.Sh CAVEATS
Do not invoke
.Fn dev_relthread
unless the matching refthread routine succeeded!
