.Dt INITTODR 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm inittodr
.Nd initialize system time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft void
.Fn inittodr "time_t base"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn inittodr
function determines the time and sets the system clock.
It tries to pick the correct time using a set of heuristics that examine
the system's battery-backed clock and the time reported by the file
system, as given in
.Fa base .
Those heuristics include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
If the battery-backed clock has a valid time, it is used.
.It
If the battery-backed clock does not have a valid time, and
the time provided in
.Fa base
is within reason,
.Fa base
is used as the current time.
.It
If the battery-backed clock appears invalid, and
.Fa base
appears nonsensical or was not provided (was given as zero),
an arbitrary base (typically some time in the late 1970s)
will be used.
.El
.Pp
Once a system time has been determined, it is passed to the
.Fn tc_setclock
function.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Fn inittodr
function prints diagnostic messages if it has trouble figuring
out the system time.
Conditions that can cause diagnostic messages to be printed include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The battery-backed clock's time appears nonsensical.
.It
The
.Fa base
time appears nonsensical.
.It
The
.Fa base
time and the battery-backed clock's time differ by a large amount.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr microtime 9 ,
.Xr resettodr 9
.Sh BUGS
Each system's heuristics for picking the correct time are slightly
different.
