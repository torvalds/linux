.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm RedZone
.Nd "buffer corruptions detector"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options KDB"
.Cd "options DDB"
.Cd "options DEBUG_REDZONE"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
detects buffer underflow and buffer overflow bugs at runtime.
Currently
.Nm
only detects buffer corruptions for memory allocated with
.Xr malloc 9 .
When such corruption is detected two backtraces are printed on the console.
The first one shows from where memory was allocated, the second one shows from
where memory was freed.
By default the system will not panic when buffer corruption is detected.
This can be changed by setting the
.Va vm.redzone.panic
.Xr sysctl 8
variable to 1.
The amount of extra memory allocated for
.Nm Ns 's
needs is stored in the
.Va vm.redzone.extra_mem
.Xr sysctl 8
variable.
.Sh EXAMPLE
The example below shows the logs from the detection of a buffer underflow and a
buffer overflow.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
REDZONE: Buffer underflow detected. 2 bytes corrupted before 0xc8688580 (16 bytes allocated).

.Sh BUGS
Currently,
.Nm
does not cooperate with
.Xr memguard 9 .
Allocations from a memory type controlled by
.Xr memguard 9
are simply skipped, so buffer corruptions will not be detected there.
