.In sys/param.h
.In sys/vnode.h
.Ft int
.Fn vinvalbuf "struct vnode *vp" "int flags" "struct ucred *cred" \
    "struct proc *p" "int slpflag" "uint64_t slptimeo"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn vinvalbuf
function invalidates all of the buffers associated with the given vnode.
This includes buffers on the clean list and the dirty list.
If the
.Dv V_SAVE
flag is specified then the buffers on the dirty list are synced prior to being
released.
If the
.Dv V_SAVEMETA
flag is set, indirect blocks will not be flushed.
.Pp
Its arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width "slptimeo"
.It Fa vp
A pointer to the vnode whose buffers will be invalidated.
.It Fa flags
The supported flags are
.Dv V_SAVE
and
.Dv V_SAVEMETA .
.Dv V_SAVE
indicates that dirty buffers should be synced with the disk.
.Dv V_SAVEMETA
indicates that indirect blocks should not be flushed.
.It Fa cred
The user credentials that are used to
.Xr VOP_FSYNC 9
buffers if
.Dv V_SAVE
is set.
.It Fa p
The process responsible for this call.
.It Fa slpflag
The slp flag that will be used in the priority of any calls to
.Xr tsleep_nsec 9
in the function.
.It Fa slptimeo
The timeout for any calls to
.Xr tsleep_nsec 9
in the function.
.El
.Sh LOCKS
The vnode is assumed to be locked prior to the call and remains locked upon
return.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
A value of 0 is returned on success.
.Sh PSEUDOCODE
.Bd -literal -offset indent
vn_lock(devvp, LK_EXCLUSIVE | LK_RETRY);
error = vinvalbuf(devvp, V_SAVE, cred, p, 0, 0);
VOP_UNLOCK(devvp);
if (error)
	return (error);
