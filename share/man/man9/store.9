.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions are designed to copy small amounts of data to user-space.
If write is successful, it is performed atomically.
The data written must be naturally aligned.
.Pp
The
.Nm
routines provide the following functionality:
.Bl -tag -width "suword64()"
.It Fn subyte
Stores a byte of data to the user-space address
.Pa base .
.It Fn suword
Stores a word of data to the user-space address
.Pa base .
.It Fn suword16
Stores 16 bits of data to the user-space address
.Pa base .
.It Fn suword32
Stores 32 bits of data to the user-space address
.Pa base .
.It Fn suword64
Stores 64 bits of data to the user-space address
.Pa base .

.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
functions return 0 on success or -1 on failure.
