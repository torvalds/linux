.Ft void
.Fn boot "int howto"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

function handles final system shutdown, and either halts or reboots
the system.
The exact action to be taken is determined by the flags passed in
.Fa howto
and by whether or not the system has finished autoconfiguration.
.Pp

.Fn boot
does the following:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
If this is the first invocation of
.Fn boot
and the
.Dv RB_NOSYNC
flag is not set in
.Fa howto ,
syncs and unmounts the system disks by calling
.Xr vfs_unmountall 9 .
.It
Disables interrupts.
.It
If rebooting after a crash (i.e., if
.Dv RB_DUMP
is set in
.Fa howto ,
but
.Dv RB_HALT
is not), saves a system crash dump.
.It
Runs any shutdown hooks previously registered.
.It
Prints a message indicating that the system is about to be halted
or rebooted.
.It
If
.Dv RB_HALT
is set in
.Fa howto ,
halts the system.
Otherwise, reboots the system.
.El
.Pp
