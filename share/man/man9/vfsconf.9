.Sh NAME
.Nm vfsconf
.Nd "vfs configuration information"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/mount.h
.Ft int
.Fn vfs_register "struct vfsconf *vfc"
.Ft int
.Fn vfs_unregister "struct vfsconf *vfc"
.Ft int
.Fn vfs_modevent "module_t mod" "int type" "void *data"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Each file system type known to the kernel has a
.Vt vfsconf
structure that contains the
information required to create a new mount of that file systems type.
.Bd -literal
struct vfsconf {
	struct	vfsops *vfc_vfsops;	/* file system operations vector */
	char	vfc_name[MFSNAMELEN];	/* file system type name */
	int	vfc_typenum;		/* historic file system type number */
	int	vfc_refcount;		/* number mounted of this type */
	int	vfc_flags;		/* permanent flags */
	struct	vfsconf *vfc_next;	/* next in list */
};
.Ed
.Pp
When a new file system is mounted,
.Xr mount 2
does a lookup of the
.Vt vfsconf
structure by its name, and if it is not already registered,
attempts to load a kernel module for it.
The file system operations for the new mount point are taken from
.Va vfc_vfsops ,
and
.Va mnt_vfc
in the
.Vt mount
structure is made to point directly at the
.Vt vfsconf
structure for the
file system type.
The file system type number is taken from
.Va vfc_typenum
which was assigned in
.Fn vfs_register ,
and the mount flags are taken from a mask of
.Va vfc_flags .
Each time a file system of a given type is mounted,
.Va vfc_refcount
is incremented.
.Pp
.Fn vfs_register
takes a new
.Vt vfsconf
structure and adds it to the list of existing file systems.
If the type has not already been registered, it is initialized by calling the
.Fn vfs_init
function in the file system operations vector.
.Fn vfs_register
also updates the oid's of any sysctl nodes for this file system type
to be the same as the newly assigned type number.
.Pp
.Fn vfs_unregister
unlinks
.Fa vfc
from the list of registered file system types if there are currently no mounted instances.
If the
.Fn vfs_uninit
function in the file systems initialization vector is defined, it is called.
.Pp
.Fn vfs_modevent
is registered by
.Fn VFS_SET
to handle the loading and unloading of file system kernel modules.
In the case of
.Dv MOD_LOAD ,
.Fn vfs_register
is called.
In the case of
.Dv MOD_UNLOAD ,
.Fn vfs_unregister
is called.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn vfs_register
returns 0 if successful; otherwise,
.Er EEXIST
is returned indicating that the file system type has already been registered.
.Pp
.Fn vfs_unregister
returns 0 if successful.
If no
.Vt vfsconf
entry can be found matching the name in
.Fa vfc ,
.Er EINVAL
is returned.
If the reference count of mounted instances of the file system type is not zero,
.Er EBUSY
is returned.
If
.Fn vfs_uninit
is called, any errors it returns will be returned by
.Fn vfs_unregister .
.Pp
.Fn vfs_modevent
returns the result of the call to
.Fn vfs_register
or
.Fn vfs_unregister ,
whatever the case.
