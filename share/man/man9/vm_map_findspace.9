.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vm_map_findspace
.Nd find a free region within a map
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In vm/vm.h
.In vm/vm_map.h
.Ft int
.Fo vm_map_findspace
.Fa "vm_map_t map" "vm_offset_t start" "vm_size_t length" "vm_offset_t *addr"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn vm_map_findspace
function attempts to find a region with sufficient space in the
.Fa map
for an object of size
.Fa length
at the address
.Fa addr .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
It is the caller's responsibility to obtain a lock on the
.Fa map
using
.Xr vm_map_lock 9
before calling this function.
.Pp
This routine may call
.Xr pmap_growkernel 9
to grow the kernel's address space, if and only if the mapping is being
made within the kernel address space, and if insufficient space remains
in the
.Va kernel_map .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn vm_map_findspace
function returns the value 0 if successful, and
.Fa *addr
will contain the first virtual address in the found region;
otherwise, the value 1 is returned.
