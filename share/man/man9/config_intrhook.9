.Dt CONFIG_INTRHOOK 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm config_intrhook
.Nd schedule a function to be run after interrupts have been enabled,
but before root is mounted
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/kernel.h
.Vt typedef void (*ich_func_t)(void *arg);
.Ft int
.Fn config_intrhook_establish "struct intr_config_hook *hook"
.Ft void
.Fn config_intrhook_disestablish "struct intr_config_hook *hook"
.Ft void
.Fn config_intrhook_oneshot "ich_func_t func" "void *arg"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn config_intrhook_establish
function schedules a function to be run after interrupts have been
enabled, but before root is mounted.
If the system has already passed this point in its initialization,
the function is called immediately.
.Pp
The
.Fn config_intrhook_disestablish
function removes the entry from the hook queue.
.Pp
The
.Fn config_intrhook_oneshot
function schedules a function to be run as described for
.Fn config_intrhook_establish ;
the entry is automatically removed from the hook queue
after that function runs.
This is appropriate when additional device configuration must be done
after interrupts are enabled, but there is no need to stall the
boot process after that.
This function allocates memory using M_WAITOK; do not call this while
holding any non-sleepable locks.
.Pp
Before root is mounted, all the previously established hooks are
run.
The boot process is then stalled until all handlers remove their hook
from the hook queue with
.Fn config_intrhook_disestablish .
The boot process then proceeds to attempt to mount the root file
system.
Any driver that can potentially provide devices they wish to be
mounted as root must use either this hook, or probe all these devices
in the initial probe.
Since interrupts are disabled during the probe process, many drivers
need a method to probe for devices with interrupts enabled.
.Pp
The requests are made with the
.Vt intr_config_hook
structure.
This structure is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
struct intr_config_hook {
	TAILQ_ENTRY(intr_config_hook) ich_links;/* Private */
	ich_func_t	ich_func;		/* function to call */
	void		*ich_arg;		/* Argument to call */
};
.Ed
.Pp
Storage for the
.Vt intr_config_hook
structure must be provided by the driver.
It must be stable from just before the hook is established until
after the hook is disestablished.
.Pp
Specifically, hooks are run at
.Fn SI_SUB_INT_CONFIG_HOOKS ,
which is immediately after the scheduler is started,
and just before the root file system device is discovered.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
A zero return value means the hook was successfully added to the queue
(with either deferred or immediate execution).
A non-zero return value means the hook could not be added to the queue
because it was already on the queue.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr DEVICE_ATTACH 9
.Sh HISTORY
These functions were introduced in
.Fx 3.0
with the CAM subsystem, but are available for any driver to use.
