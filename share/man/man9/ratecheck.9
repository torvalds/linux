.Sh NAME
.Nm ratecheck ,
.Nm ppsratecheck
.Nd "event rate limiting"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/time.h
.Ft int
.Fn ratecheck "struct timeval *lasttime" "struct timeval *mininterval"
.Ft int
.Fn ppsratecheck "struct timeval *lasttime" "int *curpps" "int maxpps"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm ratecheck
and
.Nm ppsratecheck
functions facilitate rate-limiting of arbitrary events.
The former enforces a minimum interval between events while the latter
enforces a maximum number of events per second.
.Pp
The
.Nm ratecheck
function compares the current time to the value pointed to by
.Fa lasttime .
If the difference is equal to or greater than
.Fa mininterval ,
it returns a non-zero value and updates
.Fa lasttime
to the current time.
Otherwise, it returns zero.
.Pp
The
.Nm ppsratecheck
function first compares the current time
to
.Fa lasttime .
If at least a full second has passed, the value pointed to by the
.Fa curpps
argument is reset to 1 and
.Fa lasttime
is updated to the current time.
Otherwise,
.Fa curpps
is incremented and
.Fa lasttime
is left untouched.
In either case,
.Nm ppsratecheck
returns a non-zero value if and only if the updated
.Fa curpps
is less than or equal to
.Fa maxpps
or
.Fa maxpps
is negative.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm ratecheck
and
.Nm ppsratecheck
functions first appeared in
.Fx 5.1 .
