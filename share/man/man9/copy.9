.Fn copyin "const void *uaddr" "void *kaddr" "size_t len"
.Ft int
.Fn copyout "const void *kaddr" "void *uaddr" "size_t len"

.Fn kcopy "const void *kfaddr" "void *kdaddr" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions are designed to copy contiguous data from one address to another.
All but
.Fn kcopy
copy data from user-space to kernel-space or vice-versa.
.Pp
The
.Nm
routines provide the following functionality:
.Bl -tag -width "copyoutstr()"
.It Fn copyin
Copies
.Fa len
bytes of data from the user-space address
.Fa uaddr
to the kernel-space address
.Fa kaddr .
.It Fn copyout
Copies
.Fa len
bytes of data from the kernel-space address
.Fa kaddr
to the user-space address
.Fa uaddr .
.It Fn copyinstr
Copies a null-terminated string, at most
.Fa len
bytes long, from user-space address
.Fa uaddr
to kernel-space address
.Fa kaddr .
The number of bytes actually copied, including the terminating null,
is returned in
.Fa *done ,
if
.Fa done
is not
.Dv NULL .
.It Fn copyoutstr
Copies a null-terminated string, at most
.Fa len
bytes long, from kernel-space address
.Fa kaddr
to user-space address
.Fa uaddr .
The number of bytes actually copied, including the terminating null,
is returned in
.Fa *done ,
if
.Fa done
is not
.Dv NULL .
.It Fn kcopy
Copies
.Fa len
bytes of data from the kernel-space address
.Fa kfaddr
to the kernel-space address
.Fa kdaddr .
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
functions return 0 on success or
.Er EFAULT
if a bad address is encountered.
In addition, the
.Fn copyinstr
and
.Fn copyoutstr
functions return
.Er ENAMETOOLONG
if the string is longer than
.Fa len
bytes.
