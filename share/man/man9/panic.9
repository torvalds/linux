The

function makes the

system terminate.
The message

is a

style format string.
The message is printed to the console (with a newline) and the location
pointed to by the global char pointer
.Fa panicstr
is set to the address of the message text for retrieval from the OS
core dump.

If the kernel debugger is installed, control is passed to it.
Otherwise, an attempt is made to save a core dump of the OS to a configured
dump device.
.Pp
If
.Fn panic
is called twice (from the disk sync routines, for example) the system is
rebooted without syncing the disks.
