.Sh NAME
.Nm accept_filter ,
.Nm accept_filt_add ,
.Nm accept_filt_del ,
.Nm accept_filt_generic_mod_event ,
.Nm accept_filt_get
.Nd filter incoming connections
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/module.h
.In sys/socket.h
.Fd #define ACCEPT_FILTER_MOD
.In sys/socketvar.h
.Ft int
.Fn accept_filt_add "struct accept_filter *filt"
.Ft int
.Fn accept_filt_del "char *name"
.Ft int
.Fn accept_filt_generic_mod_event "module_t mod" "int event" "void *data"
.Ft struct accept_filter *
.Fn accept_filt_get "char *name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Accept filters allow an application to request
that the kernel pre-process incoming connections.
An accept filter is requested via the
.Xr setsockopt 2
system call, passing in an
.Fa optname
of
.Dv SO_ACCEPTFILTER .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
A module that wants to be an accept filter
must provide a
.Vt "struct accept_filter"
to the system:
.Bd -literal
struct accept_filter {
	char	accf_name[16];
	void	(*accf_callback)(struct socket *so, void *arg, int waitflag);
	void *	(*accf_create)(struct socket *so, char *arg);
	void	(*accf_destroy)(struct socket *so);
	SLIST_ENTRY(accept_filter) accf_next;	/* next on the list */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The module should register it with the function
.Fn accept_filt_add ,
passing a pointer to a
.Vt "struct accept_filter" ,
allocated with
.Xr malloc 9 .
.Pp
The fields of
.Vt "struct accept_filter"
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va accf_callback"
.It Va accf_name
Name of the filter;
this is how it will be accessed from userland.
.It Va accf_callback
The callback that the kernel will do
once the connection is established.
It is the same as a socket upcall
and will be called when the connection is established
and whenever new data arrives on the socket,
unless the callback modifies the socket's flags.
.It Va accf_create
Called whenever a
.Xr setsockopt 2
installs the filter onto
a listening socket.
.It Va accf_destroy
Called whenever the user removes the accept filter on the socket.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn accept_filt_del
function
passed the same string used in
.Va accept_filter.accf_name
during registration with
.Fn accept_filt_add ,
the kernel will then disallow and further userland use of the filter.
.Pp
The
.Fn accept_filt_get
function is used internally to locate which accept filter to use via the
.Xr setsockopt 2
system call.
.Pp
The
.Fn accept_filt_generic_mod_event
function provides a simple way to avoid duplication of code
for accept filters which do not use the argument field to load
and unload themselves.
This function can be used in the
.Vt moduledata_t
struct for the
.Xr DECLARE_MODULE 9
macro.
