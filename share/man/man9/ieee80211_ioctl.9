.Sh NAME

.Nd 802.11 interface ioctl commands
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In net80211/ieee80211_var.h
.In net80211/ieee80211_proto.h
.In net80211/ieee80211_ioctl.h
.Ft int
.Fn ieee80211_ioctl "struct ifnet *ifp" "u_long cmd" "caddr_t data"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These
functions are typically invoked by drivers in response to requests
for information or to change settings from the userland.
.Pp
.\"
The
.Fn ieee80211_ioctl
function provides a default implementation of the
.Dv SIOCS80211
and
.Dv SIOCG80211
ifioctls commands for 802.11 drivers.
The call signature is identical to that of the
.Va if_ioctl
member found in
.Vt struct ifnet ,
however, many drivers store attributes such as
.Dv IEEE80211_IOC_STATIONNAME
in the driver's private soft state structure, so driver writers may prefer
to use this as the catch-all in a switch statement to avoid code duplication.
