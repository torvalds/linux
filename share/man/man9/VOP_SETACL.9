.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm VOP_SETACL
.Nd set the access control list for a vnode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/vnode.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft int
.Fn VOP_SETACL "struct vnode *vp" "acl_type_t type" "struct acl *aclp" "struct ucred *cred" "struct thread *td"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This vnode call may be used to set the access control list (ACL) for a file
or directory.
.Pp
Its arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width type
.It Fa vp
The vnode of the file or directory.
.It Fa type
The type of ACL to set.
.It Fa aclp
A pointer to an ACL structure from which to retrieve the ACL data.
.It Fa cred
The user credentials to use in authorizing the request.
.It Fa td
The thread setting the ACL.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa aclp
pointer may be
.Dv NULL
to indicate that the specified ACL should be deleted.
.Pp
The
.Fa cred
pointer may be
.Dv NULL
to indicate that access control checks are not to be performed, if possible.
This cred setting might be used to allow the kernel to authorize ACL
changes that the active process might not be permitted to make.
.Pp
The vnode ACL interface defines the syntax, and not semantics, of file and
directory ACL interfaces.
More information about ACL management in kernel
may be found in
.Xr acl 9 .
.Sh LOCKS
The vnode will be locked on entry and should remain locked on return.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the ACL is successfully set, then zero is returned.
Otherwise, an appropriate error code is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The ACL type passed is invalid for this vnode, or the ACL data is invalid.
.It Bq Er EACCES
The caller does not have the appropriate privilege.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Sufficient memory is not available to fulfill the request.
.It Bq Er EOPNOTSUPP
The file system does not support
.Fn VOP_SETACL .
.It Bq Er ENOSPC
The file system is out of space.
.It Bq Er EROFS
The file system is read-only.
