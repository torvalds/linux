.Sh NAME
.Nm uvm_km_suballoc ,
.Nm uvm_km_free
.Nd raw kernel memory or address space allocator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In uvm/uvm.h
.Fn uvm_km_suballoc "vm_map_t map" "vaddr_t *min" "vaddr_t *max " "vsize_t size" "int flags" "boolean_t fixed" "vm_map_t submap"
.Ft void
.Fn uvm_km_free "vm_map_t map" "vaddr_t addr" "vsize_t size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn uvm_km_suballoc
function allocates submap (with the specified
.Fa flags ,
as described above) from
.Fa map ,
creating a new map if
.Fa submap
is
.Dv NULL .
The addresses of the submap can be specified exactly by setting the
.Fa fixed
argument to non-zero, which causes the
.Fa min
argument to specify the beginning of the address in the submap.
If
.Fa fixed
is zero, any address of size
.Fa size
will be allocated from
.Fa map
and the start and end addresses returned in
.Fa min
and
.Fa max .
.Pp
The
.Fn uvm_km_free
function free
.Fa size
bytes of memory in the kernel map, starting at address
.Fa addr .
