.Sh NAME
.Nm iflib
.Nd Network Interface Driver Framework
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a framework for writing network interface drivers for FreeBSD.
It is designed to remove a large amount of the boilerplate that is often
needed for modern network interface devices, allowing driver authors to
focus on the specific code needed for their hardware.
.Pp
There are three logical components to
.Nm
each of which is described in its own manual page.
These are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Xr iflibtxrx 9"
.It Xr iflibdi 9
Device-independent functions, used to integrate
.Nm
into the rest of the
.Fx
networking stack.
.It Xr iflibdd 9
Device-dependent functions, used when writing new
.Nm
based drivers.
.It Xr iflibtxrx 9
Device-dependent transmit and receive functions, used when writing new
.Nm
based drivers.
