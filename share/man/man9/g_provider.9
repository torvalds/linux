.Dt G_PROVIDER 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm g_new_providerf ,
.Nm g_destroy_provider ,
.Nm g_error_provider
.Nd "GEOM providers management"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In geom/geom.h
.Ft "struct g_provider *"
.Fn g_new_providerf "struct g_geom *gp" "const char *fmt" ...
.Ft void
.Fn g_destroy_provider "struct g_provider *pp"
.Ft void
.Fn g_error_provider "struct g_provider *pp" "int error"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A GEOM provider is the front gate at which a geom offers service.
A provider is
.Dq a disk-like thing which appears in Pa /dev
\[en] a logical disk in other words.
All providers have three main properties: name, sectorsize and size.
.Pp
The
.Fn g_new_providerf
function creates a new provider on given geom
.Fa gp .
The name of the provider, which will appear as device in
.Xr devfs 5 ,
is created
in a
.Xr printf 3 Ns
-like way from the rest of
the arguments.
After creation, the caller has to set the provider's
.Va mediasize
and
.Va sectorsize ,
as well as other desired initializations, and then call
.Fn g_error_provider
to reset the provider's error, which is initially set to
.Er ENXIO .
.Pp
The
.Fn g_destroy_provider
function destroys the given provider, cancels all related pending events and
removes the corresponding devfs entry.
.Pp
The
.Fn g_error_provider
function is used to set the provider's error value.
If set to a nonzero, all I/O requests will be denied,
as well as increasing its access count will not be possible (error
.Fa error
will be returned).
.Sh RESTRICTIONS/CONDITIONS
.Fn g_new_provider :
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
The provider name should be unique, but this is not enforced by GEOM.
If the name is not unique, one will end up with two (or more) files
with the same name, which is a programmer error.
.It
The geom
.Fa gp
has to have a
.Fa start
method defined.
.It
The topology lock has to be held.
.El
.Pp
.Fn g_destroy_provider :
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
The provider must not have consumers attached.
.It
The access count has to be 0.
.It
The topology lock has to be held.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn g_new_providerf
function returns a pointer to the newly created provider.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create an example provider, set its parameters and make it usable.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct g_provider *
create_example_provider(struct g_geom *gp)
{
	struct g_provider *pp;

	g_topology_lock();
	pp = g_new_providerf(gp, "example_provider");
	g_topology_unlock();
	pp->mediasize = 65536;
	pp->sectorsize = 512;
	g_error_provider(pp, 0);

	return (pp);
