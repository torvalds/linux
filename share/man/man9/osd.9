.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
framework provides a mechanism to dynamically associate arbitrary data at
run-time with any kernel data structure which has been suitably modified for use
with
.Nm .
The one-off modification required involves embedding a
.Vt "struct osd"
inside the kernel data structure.
.Pp
An additional benefit is that after the initial change to a structure is made,
all subsequent use of
.Nm
with the structure involves no changes to the structure's layout.
By extension, if the data structure is part of the ABI,
.Nm
provides a way of extending the structure in an ABI preserving manner.
.Pp
The details of the embedded
.Vt "struct osd"
are not relevant to consumers of the
.Nm
framework and should not be manipulated directly.
.Pp
Data associated with a structure is referenced by the
.Nm
framework using a type/slot identifier pair.
Types are statically defined in
.In sys/osd.h
and provide a high-level grouping for slots to be registered under.
Slot identifiers are dynamically assigned by the framework when a data type is
registered using
.Fn osd_register
and remains valid until a corresponding call to
.Fn osd_deregister .
.Ss Functions
The
.Fn osd_register
function registers a type/slot identifier pair with the
.Nm
framework for use with a new data type.
The function may sleep and therefore cannot be called from a non-sleepable
context.
The
.Fa type
argument specifies which high-level type grouping from
.In sys/osd.h
the slot identifier should be allocated under.
The
.Fa destructor
argument specifies an optional osd_destructor_t function pointer that will be
called for objects of the type being registered which are later destroyed by the
.Fn osd_del
function.
NULL may be passed if no destructor is required.
The
.Fa methods
argument specifies an optional array of osd_method_t function pointers which
can be later invoked by the
.Fn osd_call
function.
NULL may be passed if no methods are required.
The
.Fa methods
argument is currently only useful with the OSD_JAIL type identifier.
.Pp
The
.Fn osd_deregister
function deregisters a previously registered type/slot identifier pair.
The function may sleep and therefore cannot be called from a non-sleepable
context.
The
.Fa type
argument specifies which high-level type grouping from
.In sys/osd.h
the slot identifier is allocated under.
The
.Fa slot
argument specifies the slot identifier which is being deregistered and should be
the value that was returned by
.Fn osd_register
when the data type was registered.
.Pp
The
.Fn osd_set
function associates a data object pointer with a kernel data structure's
.Vt struct osd
member.
The
.Fa type
argument specifies which high-level type grouping from
.In sys/osd.h
the slot identifier is allocated under.
The
.Fa osd
argument is a pointer to the kernel data structure's
.Vt struct osd
which will have the
.Fa value
pointer associated with it.
The
.Fa slot
argument specifies the slot identifier to assign the
.Fa value
pointer to.
The
.Fa value
argument points to a data object to associate with
.Fa osd .
.Pp
The
.Fn osd_set_reserved
function does the same as
.Fn osd_set ,
but with an extra argument
.Fa rsv
that is internal-use memory previously allocated via
.Fn osd_reserve .
.Pp
The
.Fn osd_get
function returns the data pointer associated with a kernel data structure's
.Vt struct osd
member from the specified type/slot identifier pair.
The
.Fa type
argument specifies which high-level type grouping from
.In sys/osd.h
the slot identifier is allocated under.
The
.Fa osd
argument is a pointer to the kernel data structure's
.Vt struct osd
to retrieve the data pointer from.
The
.Fa slot
argument specifies the slot identifier to retrieve the data pointer from.
.Pp
The
.Fn osd_del
function removes the data pointer associated with a kernel data structure's
.Vt struct osd
member from the specified type/slot identifier pair.
The
.Fa type
argument specifies which high-level type grouping from
.In sys/osd.h
the slot identifier is allocated under.
The
.Fa osd
argument is a pointer to the kernel data structure's
.Vt struct osd
to remove the data pointer from.
The
.Fa slot
argument specifies the slot identifier to remove the data pointer from.
If an osd_destructor_t function pointer was specified at registration time, the
destructor function will be called and passed the data pointer for the type/slot
identifier pair which is being deleted.
.Pp
The
.Fn osd_call
function calls the specified osd_method_t function pointer for all
currently registered slots of a given type on the specified
.Fa obj
and
.Fa data
pointers.
The function may sleep and therefore cannot be called from a non-sleepable
context.
The
.Fa type
argument specifies which high-level type grouping from
.In sys/osd.h
to call the method for.
The
.Fa method
argument specifies the index into the osd_method_t array that was passed to
.Fn osd_register .
The
.Fa obj
and
.Fa data
arguments are passed to the method function pointer of each slot.
.Pp
The
.Fn osd_exit
function removes all data object pointers from all currently registered slots
for a given type for the specified kernel data structure's
.Vt struct osd
member.
The
.Fa type
argument specifies which high-level type grouping from
.In sys/osd.h
to remove data pointers from.
The
.Fa osd
argument is a pointer to the kernel data structure's
.Vt struct osd
to remove all data object pointers for all currently registered slots from.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Nm
uses a two dimensional matrix (array of arrays) as the data structure to manage
the external data associated with a kernel data structure's
.Vt struct osd
member.
The type identifier is used as the index into the outer array, and the slot
identifier is used as the index into the inner array.
To set or retrieve a data pointer for a given type/slot identifier pair,
.Fn osd_set
and
.Fn osd_get
perform the equivalent of array[type][slot], which is both constant time and
fast.
.Pp
If
.Fn osd_set
is called on a
.Vt struct osd
for the first time, the array for storing data pointers is dynamically allocated
using
.Xr malloc 9
with M_NOWAIT to a size appropriate for the slot identifier being set.
If a subsequent call to
.Fn osd_set
attempts to set a slot identifier which is numerically larger than the slot used
in the previous
.Fn osd_set
call,
.Xr realloc 9
is used to grow the array to the appropriate size such that the slot identifier
can be used.
To maximise the efficiency of any code which calls
.Fn osd_set
sequentially on a number of different slot identifiers (e.g., during an
initialisation phase) one should loop through the slot identifiers in descending
order from highest to lowest.
This will result in only a single
.Xr malloc 9
call to create an array of the largest slot size and all subsequent calls to
.Fn osd_set
will proceed without any
.Xr realloc 9
calls.
.Pp
It is possible for
.Fn osd_set
to fail to allocate this array.
To ensure that such allocation succeeds,
.Fn osd_reserve
may be called (in a non-blocking context), and it will pre-allocate the
memory via
.Xr malloc 9
with M_WAITOK.
Then this pre-allocated memory is passed to
.Fn osd_set_reserved ,
which will use it if necessary or otherwise discard it.
The memory may also be explicitly discarded by calling
.Fn osd_free_reserved .
As this method always allocates memory whether or not it is ultimately needed,
it should be used only rarely, such as in the unlikely event that
.Fn osd_set
fails.
.Pp
The
.Nm
API is geared towards slot identifiers storing pointers to the same underlying
data structure type for a given
.Nm
type identifier.
This is not a requirement, and
.Xr khelp 9
for example stores completely different data types in slots under the OSD_KHELP
type identifier.
.Ss Locking
.Nm
internally uses a mix of
.Xr mutex 9 ,
.Xr rmlock 9
and
.Xr sx 9
locks to protect its internal data structures and state.
.Pp
Responsibility for synchronising access to a kernel data structure's
.Vt struct osd
member is left to the subsystem that uses the data structure and calls the
.Nm
API.
.Pp
.Fn osd_get
only acquires an
.Xr rmlock
in read mode, therefore making it safe to use in the majority of contexts within
the kernel including most fast paths.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn osd_register
returns the slot identifier for the newly registered data type.
.Pp
.Fn osd_set
and
.Fn osd_set_reserved
return zero on success or ENOMEM if the specified type/slot identifier pair
triggered an internal
.Xr realloc 9
which failed
.Ns (
.Fn osd_set_reserved
will always succeed when
.Fa rsv
is non-NULL).
.Pp
.Fn osd_get
returns the data pointer for the specified type/slot identifier pair, or NULL if
the slot has not been initialised yet.
.Pp
.Fn osd_reserve
returns a pointer suitable for passing to
.Fn osd_set_reserved
or
.Fn osd_free_reserved .
.Pp
.Fn osd_call
returns zero if no method is run or the method for each slot runs successfully.
If a method for a slot returns non-zero,
.Fn osd_call
terminates prematurely and returns the method's error to the caller.
