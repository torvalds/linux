.Dt ATOMIC_SWAP_UINT 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm atomic_swap_uint ,
.Nm atomic_swap_ulong ,
.Nm atomic_swap_ptr
.Nd atomic swap operations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/atomic.h
.Ft unsigned int
.Fn atomic_swap_uint "volatile unsigned int *p" "unsigned int new"
.Ft unsigned long
.Fn atomic_swap_ulong "volatile unsigned long *p" "unsigned long new"
.Ft void *
.Fn atomic_swap_ptr "volatile void *p" "void *new"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The atomic_swap set of functions provide an interface for atomically
performing swap operations with respect to interrupts and multiple
processors in the system.
.Pp
The value referenced by the pointer
.Fa p
is replaced by the value
.Fa new .
.Sh CONTEXT
.Fn atomic_swap_uint ,
.Fn atomic_swap_ulong ,
and
.Fn atomic_swap_ptr
can all be called during autoconf, from process context, or from interrupt context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return the value at
.Fa p
as it was before the swap operation.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr atomic_cas_uint 9
.Sh HISTORY
The atomic_swap functions first appeared in
.Nx 5.0
and
.Ox 5.5 .
