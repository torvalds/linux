.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

Memory for the firmware is allocated using
.Xr malloc 9

.Va M_DEVBUF
as need be, within a reasonable size limit.
.Pp
If no longer needed, the firmware buffer
.Va buf
can be freed using
.Xr free 9
with type
.Va M_DEVBUF .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Ar buf
is set to point to the allocation and
.Ar buflen
is set to the size of the firmware.
Then
.Fn loadfirmware
returns 0.
Otherwise, it returns an

style error.
