.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface is used by each filesystem to improve I/O performance using
in-core caches of filesystem blocks.
.Pp
The kernel memory used to cache a block is called a buffer and
described by a
.Em buf
structure.
In addition to describing a cached block, a
.Em buf
structure is also used to describe an I/O request as a part of
the disk driver interface.
.Pp
The block size used for logical block numbers depends on the type of the
given vnode.
For file vnodes, this is f_iosize of the underlying filesystem.
For block device vnodes, this will usually be DEV_BSIZE.
.\" XXX struct buf, B_ flags, MP locks, etc.
.\" XXX free list, hash queue, etc.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn bread "vp" "blkno" "size" "bpp"
Read a block corresponding to
.Fa vp
and
.Fa blkno .
The buffer is returned via
.Fa bpp .
.Pp
If the buffer is not found (i.e. the block is not cached in memory),
.Fn bread
calls
.Fn getblk
to allocate a buffer with enough pages for
.Fa size
and reads the specified disk block into it.
.Pp
.Fn bread
always returns a buffer, even if it returns an error due to an I/O
error.
.Pp
The buffer returned by
.Fn bread
is marked as busy.
(The
.Dv B_BUSY
flag is set.)
After manipulation of the buffer returned from
.Fn bread ,
the caller should unbusy it so that another thread can get it.
If the buffer contents are modified and should be written back to disk,
it should be unbusied using one of the variants of
.Fn bwrite .
Otherwise, it should be unbusied using
.Fn brelse .

.Fa "vp"
.Fa "blkno"
.Fa "size"
.Fa "rablks"
.Fa "rasizes"
.Fa "nrablks"
.Fa "bpp"
.Fc
.Xc
Get a buffer as
.Fn bread .
In addition,
.Fn breadn
will start read-ahead of blocks specified by
.Fa rablks ,
.Fa rasizes ,
and
.Fa nrablks .
The read-ahead blocks aren't returned, but are available in cache for
future accesses.

.It Xo
.Fo bread_cluster
.Fa "vp"
.Fa "blkno"
.Fa "size"
.Fa "bpp"
.Fc
.Xc
Read a block of size
.Fa "size"
corresponding to
.Fa vp
and
.Fa blkno ,
with readahead.
If neither the first block nor a part of the next MAXBSIZE bytes is already
in the buffer cache,
.Fn bread_cluster
will perform a read-ahead of MAXBSIZE bytes in a single I/O operation.
This is currently more efficient than
.Fn breadn .
The read-ahead data isn't returned, but is available in cache for
future access.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn bwrite "bp"
Write a block.
Start I/O for write using
.Fn VOP_STRATEGY .
Then, unless the
.Dv B_ASYNC
flag is set in
.Fa bp ,
.Fn bwrite
waits for the I/O to complete.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn bawrite "bp"
Write a block asynchronously.
Set the
.Dv B_ASYNC
flag in
.Fa bp
and simply call
.Fn VOP_BWRITE ,
which results in
.Fn bwrite
for most filesystems.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn bdwrite "bp"
Delayed write.
Unlike
.Fn bawrite ,
.Fn bdwrite
won't start any I/O.
It only marks the buffer as dirty
.Pq Dv B_DELWRI
and unbusies it.
This routine should be used when the buffer is expected
to be modified again soon, typically a small write that
partially fills a buffer.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn getblk "vp" "blkno" "size" "slpflag" "slptimeo"
Get a block of requested size
.Fa size
that is associated with a given vnode and block
offset, specified by
.Fa vp
and
.Fa blkno .
If it is found in the block cache, mark it as having been found,
make it busy and return it.
Otherwise, return an empty block of the correct size.
It is up to the caller to ensure that the cached blocks
are of the correct size.
.Pp
If
.Fn getblk
needs to sleep,
.Fa slpflag
and
.Fa slptimeo
are used as arguments for
.Xr tsleep_nsec 9 .
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn geteblk "size"
Allocate an empty, disassociated block of a given size
.Fa size .
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn incore "vp" "blkno"
Determine if a block associated with a given vnode and block offset
is in the cache.
If it is there, return a pointer to it.
Note that
.Fn incore
doesn't mark the buffer as busy unlike
.Fn getblk .
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn brelse "bp"
Unlock a buffer by clearing the
.Dv B_AGE ,
.Dv B_ASYNC ,
.Dv B_BUSY ,
.Dv B_NOCACHE ,
and
.Dv B_DEFERRED
flags and release it to the free lists.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn biodone "bp"
Mark I/O complete on a buffer.
If a callback has been requested by
.Dv B_CALL ,
do so.
Otherwise, wake up the waiting processes.
.\" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
.It Fn biowait "bp"
Wait for operations on the buffer to complete.
When they do, extract and return the I/O's error value.
If the operation on the buffer is being done via a direct call to a
.Fn strategy
type function, then the buffer must be previously initialized with the
.Dv B_RAW
flag.
