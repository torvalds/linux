.Sh NAME
.Nm pseudofs
.Nd pseudo file system construction kit
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In fs/pseudofs/pseudofs.h
.\" Insert usage example here
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module offers an abstract API for pseudo-file systems such as
.Xr procfs 5
and
.Xr linprocfs 5 .
It takes care of all the hairy bits like interfacing with the VFS
system, enforcing access control, keeping track of file numbers, and
cloning files and directories that are process-specific.
The consumer module, i.e., the module that implements the actual guts
of the file system, needs only provide the directory structure
(represented by a collection of structures declared and initialized by
macros provided by
.Nm )
and callbacks that report file attributes or write the actual file
contents into sbufs.
