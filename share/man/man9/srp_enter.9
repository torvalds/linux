.Sh DESCRIPTION
An
srp
structure represents a pointer or reference to an object in memory.
The
srp
API provides concurrent lock free access to these objects, and can
guarantee that the data isn't destroyed while that reference is in
use.
It does not prevent concurrent modification of the referenced object.
.Pp
.Fn srp_init
initialises the srp structure
.Fa p
to an empty state.
.Pp
.Fn srp_gc_init
initialises the srp_gc structure
.Fa gc
so it can be used as a garbage collector for data that gets referenced by srp
structures.
An update to an srp structure will cause the old data to be destroyed when it
is no longer referenced by any CPU in the system.
The old data will be destroyed by the garbage collector by a call to
.Fa dtor
with
.Fa ctx
as the first argument and the pointer to the data as the second argument.
.Pp
.Fn srp_update
and
.Fn srp_update_locked
replace the data referenced by the srp struct
.Fa p
with the data referenced by
.Fa v .
When the original data is no longer in use, it will be destroyed by the garbage
collector
.Fa gc .
.Fn srp_update
uses atomic CPU operations to change the references.
.Fn srp_update_locked
may be used if modifications to
.Fa p
are already serialised by the caller.
Both
.Fn srp_update
and
.Fn srp_update_locked
may sleep.
.Pp
.Fn srp_swap
and
.Fn srp_swap_locked
replace the data referenced by the srp struct
.Fa p
with the data referenced by
.Fa v .
When clearing or replacing the last reference to a data structure,
.Fn srp_finalize
must be used to ensure that the data is no longer in use via any srp
structures.
.Fn srp_swap
uses atomic CPU operations to change the reference.
.Fn srp_swap_locked
may be used if modifications to
.Fa p
are already serialised by the caller.
.Pp
.Fn srp_enter
returns a pointer to a data structure referenced by the srp struct
.Fa p
and guarantees it will remain available for use until it is released with a
call to
.Fn srp_leave
or
.Fn srp_follow .
The reference is held via
.Fa sr .
.Pp
.Fn srp_follow
replaces the reference held via
.Fa sr
with a reference to the data structure represented by
.Fa p .
.Pp
.Fn srp_leave
releases the reference held via
.Fa sr
and makes it available for garbage collection.
.Pp
.Fn srp_get_locked
provides access to the data referenced by the srp
.Fa p
if the caller has excluded updates to
.Fa p .
.Pp
.Fn srp_finalize
sleeps until there are no longer any references to
.Fa v
via any srp structure in the system.
.Pp
.Fn srp_gc_finalize
sleeps until all references to data by srp structures using the
garbage collector
.Fa gc
have completed.
That in turn means the
.Fa gc
structure will no longer be referenced and can itself be destroyed.
.Pp
A srp structure declaration can be initialised with the
.Fn SRP_INITIALIZER
macro.
.Pp
A srp_gc structure declaration can be initialised with the
.Fn SRP_GC_INITIALIZER
macro.
Data will be destroyed by the garbage collector by a call to
.Fa dtor
with
.Fa ctx
as the first argument and the pointer to the data as the second argument.
.Sh CONTEXT
.Fn srp_init ,
.Fn srp_gc_init ,
.Fn srp_update ,
.Fn srp_update_locked ,
.Fn srp_get_locked ,
.Fn srp_finalize ,
and
.Fn srp_gc_finalize
can be called during autoconf or from process context.
.Pp
.Fn srp_swap ,
.Fn srp_swap_locked ,
.Fn srp_enter ,
.Fn srp_follow ,
and
.Fn srp_leave
can be called during autoconf, from process context, or from interrupt context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn srp_swap
and
.Fn srp_swap_locked
return a pointer to the previous value referenced by the srp structure
.Fa p .
.Pp
.Fn srp_enter ,
.Fn srp_follow ,
and
.Fn srp_get_locked
return a pointer to the data referenced by the srp structure
.Fa p
or
.Dv NULL .
.Sh HISTORY
The srp API was originally written by
.An Jonathan Matthew Aq Mt jmatthew@openbsd.org
and
.An David Gwynne Aq Mt dlg@openbsd.org .
The srp API first appeared in
.Ox 5.8 .
