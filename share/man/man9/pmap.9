.Sh NAME
.Nm pmap
.Nd machine-dependent portion of virtual memory subsystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In vm/vm.h
.In vm/pmap.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module is the machine-dependent portion of the
.Fx
VM (Virtual Memory) sub-system.
Each function documented herein must have its own
architecture-dependent implementation.
.Pp
The
.Nm
module
is responsible for managing hardware-dependent objects such as page tables,
address maps, TLBs, etc.
.Pp
Machine-dependent code must provide the header file
.In machine/pmap.h .
This file contains the definition of the
.Vt pmap
structure:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct pmap {
        /* Contents defined by pmap implementation. */
};
typedef struct pmap *pmap_t;
.Ed
.Pp
This header file may also define other data structures used by the
.Nm
implementation.
.Pp
The header file
.In vm/pmap.h
defines a structure for tracking
.Nm
statistics (see below).
This structure is defined as:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct pmap_statistics {
        long        resident_count; /* number of mapped pages */
        long        wired_count;    /* number of wired pages */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The implementation's
.Vt "struct pmap"
must contain an instance of this structure having the name
.Va pm_stats ,
and it must be updated by the implementation after each relevant
.Nm
operation.
