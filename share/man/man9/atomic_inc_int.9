.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm atomic_inc_int ,
.Nm atomic_inc_int_nv ,
.Nm atomic_inc_long ,
.Nm atomic_inc_long_nv
.Nd atomic increment operations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/atomic.h
.Ft void
.Fn atomic_inc_int "volatile unsigned int *p"
.Ft unsigned int
.Fn atomic_inc_int_nv "volatile unsigned int *p"
.Ft void
.Fn atomic_inc_long "volatile unsigned long *p "
.Ft unsigned long
.Fn atomic_inc_long_nv "volatile unsigned long *p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The atomic_inc set of functions provide an interface for atomically
performing increment and increment-and-fetch operations with respect
to interrupts and multiple processors in the system.
.Pp
The value referenced by the pointer
.Fa p
is incremented by 1.
.Sh CONTEXT
.Fn atomic_inc_int ,
.Fn atomic_inc_int_nv ,
.Fn atomic_inc_long ,
and
.Fn atomic_inc_long_nv
can all be called during autoconf, from process context, or from interrupt context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm atomic_inc_int
and
.Nm atomic_inc_long
perform the increment without returning any knowledge of the value at
.Fa p .
.Pp
.Nm atomic_inc_int_nv
and
.Nm atomic_inc_long_nv
return the value at
.Fa p
after the increment was performed.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr atomic_add_int 9 ,
.Xr atomic_dec_int 9
.Sh HISTORY
The atomic_inc functions first appeared in
.Nx 5.0
and
.Ox 5.5 .
