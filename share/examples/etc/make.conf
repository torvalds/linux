# NOTE:  Please would any committer updating this file also update the
# make.conf(5) manual page, if necessary, which is located in
# src/share/man/man5/make.conf.5.
#
# /etc/make.conf, if present, will be read by make (see
# /usr/share/mk/sys.mk).  It allows you to override macro definitions
# to make without changing your source tree, or anything the source
# tree installs.
#
# This file must be in valid Makefile syntax.
#
# There are additional things you can put into /etc/make.conf.
# You have to find those in the Makefiles and documentation of
# the source tree.
#
# Note, that you should not set MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX or MAKEOBJDIR
# from make.conf (or as command line variables to make).
# Both variables are environment variables for make and must be used as:
#
# env MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=/big/directory make
#
#
# The CPUTYPE variable controls which processor should be targeted for
# generated code.  This controls processor-specific optimizations in
# certain code (currently only OpenSSL) as well as modifying the value
# of CFLAGS to contain the appropriate optimization directive to cc.
# The automatic setting of CFLAGS may be overridden using the
# NO_CPU_CFLAGS variable below.
# Currently the following CPU types are recognized:
#   Intel x86 architecture:
#       (AMD CPUs)	amdfam10, opteron-sse3, athlon64-sse3, k8-sse3,
#			opteron, athlon64, athlon-fx, k8, athlon-mp,
#			athlon-xp, athlon-4, athlon-tbird, athlon, k7,
#			geode, k6-3, k6-2, k6
#       (Intel CPUs)	core2, core, nocona, pentium4m, pentium4, prescott,
#			pentium3m, pentium3, pentium-m, pentium2,
#			pentiumpro, pentium-mmx, pentium, i486
#       (VIA CPUs)	c7, c3-2, c3
#   AMD64 architecture:	amdfam10, opteron-sse3, athlon64-sse3, k8-sse3,
#			opteron, athlon64, k8, core2, nocona
#   SPARC-V9 architecture:	v9 (generic 64-bit V9), ultrasparc (default
#				if omitted), ultrasparc3
# Additionally the following CPU types are recognized by clang:
#   Intel x86 architecture (for both amd64 and i386):
#       (AMD CPUs)	znver1, bdver4, bdver3, bdver2, bdver1, btver2, btver1
#       (Intel CPUs)	cascadelake, tremont, goldmont-plus, icelake-server,
#			icelake-client, cannonlake, knm, skylake-avx512, knl,
#			goldmont, skylake, broadwell, haswell, ivybridge,
#			sandybridge, westmere, nehalem, silvermont, bonnell

#NO_CPU_CFLAGS=		# Don't add -march=<cpu> to CFLAGS automatically
#
# CFLAGS controls the compiler settings used when compiling C code.
# Note that optimization settings other than -O and -O2 are not recommended
# or supported for compiling the world or the kernel - please revert any
# nonstandard optimization settings
# before submitting bug reports without patches to the developers.
#
# CFLAGS.arch provides a mechanism for applying CFLAGS only when building
# the given architecture.  This is useful primarily on a system used for
# cross-building, when you have a set of flags to apply to the TARGET_ARCH
# being cross-built but don't want those settings applied to building the
# cross-tools or other components that run on the build host machine.
#
# CXXFLAGS controls the compiler settings used when compiling C++ code.
# Note that CXXFLAGS is initially set to the value of CFLAGS.  If you wish
# to add to CXXFLAGS value, "+=" must be used rather than "=".  Using "="
# alone will remove the often needed contents of CFLAGS from CXXFLAGS.
#
# Additional compiler flags can be specified that extend or override
# default ones. However, neither the base system nor ports are guaranteed
# to build and function without problems with non-default settings.

#
# MAKE_SHELL controls the shell used internally by make(1) to process the
# command scripts in makefiles.  Three shells are supported, sh, ksh, and
# csh.  Using sh is most common, and advised.  Using ksh *may* work, but is
# not guaranteed to.  Using csh is absurd.  The default is to use sh.
#
#MAKE_SHELL?=sh
#
# BDECFLAGS are a set of gcc warning settings that Bruce Evans has suggested
# for use in developing FreeBSD and testing changes.  They can be used by
# putting "CFLAGS+=${BDECFLAGS}" in /etc/make.conf.  -Wconversion is not
# included here due to compiler bugs, e.g., mkdir()'s mode_t argument.

#		-Wredundant-decls -Wshadow -Wstrict-prototypes -Wwrite-strings

# To compile just the kernel with special optimizations, you should use
# this instead of CFLAGS (which is not applicable to kernel builds anyway).

# Setting the following variables modifies the build environment for
# sendmail and its related utilities. For example, SASL support can be
# added with settings such as:
#
#    with SASLv1:
#	SENDMAIL_CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/sasl1 -DSASL
#	SENDMAIL_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
#	SENDMAIL_LDADD=-lsasl

#    with SASLv2:
#	SENDMAIL_CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include -DSASL=2
#	SENDMAIL_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
#	SENDMAIL_LDADD=-lsasl2
#
# Note: If you are using Cyrus SASL with other applications which require
#	access to the sasldb file, you should add the following to your
#	sendmail.mc file:
#
#	define(`confDONT_BLAME_SENDMAIL',`GroupReadableSASLDBFile')
#
#SENDMAIL_CFLAGS=
#SENDMAIL_LDFLAGS=
#SENDMAIL_LDADD=
#SENDMAIL_DPADD=
#
# Setting SENDMAIL_SET_USER_ID will install the sendmail binary as a
# set-user-ID root binary instead of a set-group-ID smmsp binary and will
# prevent the installation of /etc/mail/submit.cf.
# This is a deprecated mode of operation.  See etc/mail/README for more
# information.

# The permissions to use on alias and map databases generated using

#
# It is also possible to set variables in make.conf which will only be
# used when compiling a specific port.  For more details see make(1).
#

# Another approach is to use /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portconf which has
# its own config file for port specific options.
