# Hierarchical queueing for a university.
# Three faculties; engineering, law and art are defined.
# Departments under the engineering faculty are defined as child queues.
# The total bandwidth for engineering faculty is shared between three
# departments. CS department gets the half of the bandwidth, EE and IE
# departments get the thirty percent and twenty percent of bandwidth
# respectively. These sibling departments can use more than their linkshare
# whenever there is no backlogged sibling queue but when a queue gets
# backlogged, it is guaranteed that the queue gets its linkshare.

altq on dc0 bandwidth 16Mb hfsc queue { eng law art }
