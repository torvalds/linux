# enable queueing on the external interface to queue packets going out
# to the Internet. use the cbq scheduler so that the bandwidth use of
# each queue can be controlled. the max outgoing bandwidth is 1.5Mbps.

# define the parameters for the child queues.
# std_ext        - the standard queue. also the default queue for
#                  outgoing traffic on fxp0.
# www_ext        - container queue for WWW server queues. limit to
#                  500Kbps.
#   www_ext_http - http traffic from the WWW server; higher priority.
#   www_ext_misc - all non-http traffic from the WWW server.
# boss_ext       - traffic coming from the boss's computer.

#              traffic on dc0.
#   it_int   - traffic to the IT Dept network; reserve them 500Kbps.
#   boss_int - traffic to the boss's PC; assign a higher priority.
