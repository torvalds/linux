-- All tests provided by the FreeBSD base system should set the test_suite
-- property to FreeBSD.  This creates a namespace in the configuration file
-- in which specific run-time properties can be passed to the tests below.
test_suite('FreeBSD')

-- Register the various test programs into the test suite defined in this
-- directory.
--
-- Note that, while Kyua supports overriding the test case metadata
-- properties (e.g. their timeout) along the test program definition, you
-- should not do so for ATF test programs.  The ATF test cases themselves
-- encode the right values.
