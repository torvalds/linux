  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permission Specifying.

To specify where to pass through or to block a packet, either block or pass
is used. In and out are used to describe the direction in which the packet
is travelling through a network interface. Eg:

# setup default to block all packets.
block in all
block out all
# pass packets from host firewall to any destination
pass in from firewall to any

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Select network Interfaces

To select which interface a packet is currently associated with, either its
destination as a result of route processing or where it has been received
from, the on keyword is used. Whilst not compulsory, it is recommended that
each rule include it for clarity. Eg:

# drop all inbound packets from localhost coming from ethernet
block in on le0 from localhost to any

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Netmasks and hosts

As not all networks are formed with classical network boundaries, it is
necessary to provide a mechanism to support VLSM (Variable Length Subnet
Masks). This package provides several ways to do this. Eg:

#
block in on le0 from mynet/26 to any
#
block in on le0 from mynet/255.255.255.192 to any
#
block in on le0 from mynet mask 255.255.255.192 to any
#
block in on le0 from mynet mask 0xffffffc0 to any

Are all valid and legal syntax with this package. However, when regenerating
rules (ie using ipfstat), this package will prefer to use the shortest valid
notation (top down).

The default netmask, when none is given is 255.255.255.255 or "/32".

To invert the match on a hostname or network, include an ! before the name
or number with no space between them.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protocol

To filter on an individual protocol, it is possible to specify the protocol
in a filter rule. Eg:

# block all incoming ICMP packets
block in on le0 proto icmp all

The name of the protocol can be any valid name from /etc/protocols or a
number.

# allow all IP packets in which are protocol 4
pass in on le0 proto 4 all

There is one exception to this rule, being "tcp/udp". If given in a ruleset,
it will match either of the two protocols. This is useful when setting up
port restrictions. Eg:

# prevent any packets destined for NFS from coming in
block in on le0 proto tcp/udp from any to any port = 2049

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Filtering IP fragments

IP fragments are bad news, in general. Recent study has shown that IP
fragments can pose a large threat to IP packet filtering, IF there are rules
used which rely on data which may be distributed across fragments. To this
package, the threat is that the TCP flags field of the TCP packet may be in
the 2nd or 3rd fragment or possibly be believed to be in the first when
actually in the 2nd or 3rd.

To filter out these nasties, it is possible to select fragmented packets out
as follows:

#
# get rid of all IP fragments
#
block in all with frag

The problem arises that fragments can actually be a non-malicious. The
really malicious ones can be grouped under the term "short fragments" and
can be filtered out as follows:

#
# get rid of all short IP fragments (too small for valid comparison)
#
block in proto tcp all with short

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

IP Options

IP options have a bad name for being a general security threat. They can be
of some use, however, to programs such as traceroute but many find this
usefulness not worth the risk.

Filtering on IP options can be achieved two ways. The first is by naming
them collectively and is done as follows:

#
# drop and log any IP packets with options set in them.
#
block in log all with ipopts
#

The second way is to actually list the names of the options you wish to
filter.

#
# drop any source routing options
#
block in quick all with opt lsrr
block in quick all with opt ssrr

[Image] NOTE that options are matched explicitly, so if I had lsrr,ssrr it
would only match packets with both options set.

It is also possible to select packets which DON'T have various options
present in the packet header. For example, to allow telnet connections
without any IP options present, the following would be done:

#
# Allow anyone to telnet in so long as they don't use IP options.
#
pass in proto tcp from any to any port = 23 with no ipopts
#
# Allow packets with strict source routing and no loose source routing
#
pass in from any to any with opt ssrr not opt lsrr

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Filtering by ports

Filtering by port number only works with the TCP and UDP IP protocols. When
specifying port numbers, either the number or the service name from
/etc/services may be used. If the proto field is used in a filter rule, it
will be used in conjunction with the port name in determining the port
number.

The possible operands available for use with port numbers are:

Operand Alias   Parameters      Result
<       lt      port#           true if port is less than given value
>       gt      port#           true if port is greater than given value
=       eq      port#           true if port is equal to than given value
!=      ne      port#           true if port is not equal to than given value
<=      le      port#           true if port is less than or equal to given value
=>      ge      port#           true if port is greater than or equal to given value

Eg:

#
# allow any TCP packets from the same subnet as foo is on through to host
# 10.1.1.2 if they are destined for port 6667.
#
pass in proto tcp from fubar/24 to 10.1.1.2/32 port = 6667
#
# allow in UDP packets which are NOT from port 53 and are destined for
# localhost
#
pass in proto udp from fubar port != 53 to localhost

Two range comparisons are also possible:

Expression Syntax:
port1#  <>      port2#          true if port is less than port1 or greater than port2
port1#  ><      port2#          true if port is greater than port1 and less than port2

[Image] NOTE that in neither case, when the port number is equal to one of
those given, does it match. Eg:

#
# block anything trying to get to X terminal ports, X:0 to X:9
#
block in proto tcp from any to any port 5999 >< 6010
#
# allow any connections to be made, except to BSD print/r-services
# this will also protect syslog.
#
block in proto tcp/udp all
pass in proto tcp/udp from any to any port 512 <> 515

Note that the last one above could just as easily be done in the reverse
fashion: allowing everything through and blocking only a small range. Note
that the port numbers are different, however, due to the difference in the
way they are compared.

#
# allow any connections to be made, except to BSD print/r-services
# this will also protect syslog.
#
pass in proto tcp/udp all
block in proto tcp/udp from any to any port 511 >< 516

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

TCP Flags (established)

Filtering on TCP flags is useful, but fraught with danger. I'd recommend
that before using TCP flags in your IP filtering, you become at least a
little bit acquainted with what the role of each of them is and when they're
used. This package will compare the flags present in each TCP packet, if
asked, and match if those present in the TCP packet are the same as in the
IP filter rule.

Some IP filtering/firewall packages allow you to filter out TCP packets
which belong to an "established" connection. This is, simply put, filtering
on packets which have the ACK bit set. The ACK bit is only set in packets
transmitted during the lifecycle of a TCP connection. It is necessary for
this flag to be present from either end for data to be transferred. If you
were using a rule which as worded something like:

allow proto tcp 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0 port = 23 10.2.0.0 255.255.0.0 established

It could be rewritten as:

pass in proto tcp 10.1.0.0/16 port = 23 10.2.0.0/16 flags A/A
pass out proto tcp 10.1.0.0/16 port = 23 10.2.0.0/16 flags A/A

A more useful flag to filter on, for TCP connections, I find, is the SYN
flag. This is only set during the initial stages of connection negotiation,
and for the very first packet of a new TCP connection, it is the only flag
set. At all other times, an ACK or maybe even an URG/PUSH flag may be set.
So, if I want to stop connections being made to my internal network
(10.1.0.0) from the outside network, I might do something like:

#
# block incoming connection requests to my internal network from the big bad
# internet.
#
block in on le0 proto tcp from any to 10.1.0.0/16 flags S/SA

If you wanted to block the replies to this (the SYN-ACK's), then you might
do:

block out on le0 proto tcp from 10.1.0.0 to any flags SA/SA

where SA represents the SYN-ACK flags both being set.

The flags after the / represent the TCP flag mask, indicating which bits of
the TCP flags you are interested in checking. When using the SYN bit in a
check, you SHOULD specify a mask to ensure that your filter CANNOT be
defeated by a packet with SYN and URG flags, for example, set (to Unix, this
is the same as a plain SYN).
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

ICMP Type/Code

ICMP can be a source of a lot of trouble for Internet Connected networks.
Blocking out all ICMP packets can be useful, but it will disable some
otherwise useful programs, such as "ping". Filtering on ICMP type allows for
pings (for example) to work. Eg:

# block all ICMP packets.
#
block in proto icmp all
#
# allow in ICMP echos and echo-replies.
#
pass in on le1 proto icmp from any to any icmp-type echo
pass in on le1 proto icmp from any to any icmp-type echorep

To specify an ICMP code, the numeric value must be used. So, if we wanted to
block all port-unreachables, we would do:

#
# block all ICMP destination unreachable packets which are port-unreachables
#
block in on le1 proto icmp from any to any icmp-type unreach code 3

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Responding to a BAD packet

To provide feedback to people trying to send packets through your filter
which you wish to disallow, you can send back either an ICMP error
(Destination Unreachable) or, if they're sending a TCP packet, a TCP RST
(Reset).

What's the difference ? TCP/IP stacks take longer to pass the ICMP errors
back, through to the application, as they can often be due to temporary
problems (network was unplugged for a second) and it is `incorrect' to shut
down a connection for this reason. Others go to the other extreme and will
shut down all connections between the two hosts for which the ICMP error is
received. The TCP RST, however, is for only *one* connection (cannot be used
for more than one) and will cause the connection to immediately shut down.
So, for example, if you're blocking port 113, and setup a rule to return a
TCP RST rather than nothing or an ICMP packet, you won't experience any
delay if the other end was attempting to make a connection to an identd
service.

Some examples are as follows:

#
# block all incoming TCP connections but send back a TCP-RST for ones to
# the ident port
#
block in proto tcp from any to any flags S/SA
block return-rst in quick proto tcp from any to any port = 113 flags S/SA
#
# block all inbound UDP packets and send back an ICMP error.
#
block return-icmp in proto udp from any to any

When returning ICMP packets, it is also possible to specify the type of ICMP
error return. This was requested so that traceroute traces could be forced
to end elegantly. To do this, the requested ICMP Unreachable code is placed
in brackets following the "return-icmp" directive:

#
# block all inbound UDP packets and send back an ICMP error.
#
block return-icmp (3) in proto udp from any to any port > 30000
block return-icmp (port-unr) in proto udp from any to any port > 30000

Those two examples are equivalent, and return an ICMP port unreachable error
packet to in response to any UDP packet received destined for a port greater
than 30,000.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Filtering IP Security Classes

For users who have packets which contain IP security bits, filtering on the
defined classes and authority levels is supported. Currently, filtering on
16bit authority flags is not supported.

As with ipopts and other IP options, it is possible to say that the packet
only matches if a certain class isn't present.

Some examples of filtering on IP security options:

#
# drop all packets without IP security options
#
block in all with no opt sec
#
# only allow packets in and out on le0 which are top secret
#
block out on le1 all
pass out on le1 all with opt sec-class topsecret
block in on le1 all
pass in on le1 all with opt sec-class topsecret

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Packet state filtering

Packet state filtering can be used for any TCP flow to short-cut later
filtering. The "short-cuts" are kept in a table, with no alterations to the
packet filter list made. Subsequent packets, if a matching packet is found
in the table, are not passed through the list. For TCP flows, the filter
will follow the ack/sequence numbers of packets and only allow packets
through which fall inside the correct window.

#
# Keep state for all outgoing telnet connections
# and disallow all other TCP traffic.
#
pass out on le1 proto tcp from any to any port = telnet keep state
block out on le1 all

For UDP packets, packet exchanges are effectively stateless. However, if a
packet is first sent out from a given port, a reply is usually expected in
answer, in the `reverse' direction.

#
# allow UDP replies back from name servers
#
pass out on le1 proto udp from any to any port = domain keep state

Held UDP state is timed out, as is TCP state for entries added which do not
have the SYN flag set. If an entry is created with the SYN flag set, any
subsequent matching packet which doesn't have this flag set (ie a SYN-ACK)
will cause it to be "timeless" (actually, the timeout defaults to 5 days),
until either a FIN or RST is seen.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Network Address Translation (NAT)

Network address translation is used to remap IP #'s from one address range
to another range of network addresses. For TCP and UDP, this also can
include the port numbers. The IP#'s/port #'s are changed when a packet is
going out through an interface and IP Filter matches it against a NAT rules.

Packets coming back in the same interface are remapped, as a matter of
course, to their original address information.

# map all tcp connections from 10.1.0.0/16 to 240.1.0.1, changing the source
# port number to something between 10,000 and 20,000 inclusive.  For all other
# IP packets, allocate an IP # between 240.1.0.0 and 240.1.0.255, temporarily
# for each new user.  In this example, ed1 is the external interface.
# Use ipnat, not ipf to load these rules.
#
map ed1 10.1.0.0/16 -> 240.1.0.1/32 portmap tcp 10000:20000
map ed1 10.1.0.0/16 -> 240.1.0.0/24

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transparent Proxy Suppoer

Transparent proxies are supported through redirection, which works in a
similar way to NAT, except that rules are triggered by input packets. To
effect redirection rules, ipnat must be used (same as for NAT) rather than
ipf.

# Redirection is triggered for input packets.
# For example, to redirect FTP connections through this box (in this case ed0
# is the interface on the "inside" where default routes point), to the local
# ftp port, forcing them to connect through a proxy, you would use:
#
rdr ed0 0.0.0.0/0 port ftp -> 127.0.0.1 port ftp

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transparent routing

Transparent routing can be performed in two ways using IP Filter. The first
is to use the keyword "fastroute" in a rule, using the normal route lookup
to occur or using a fixed route with "to". Both effect transparent routing
by not causing any decrement in the TTL to occur as it passes through the
kernel.

# Route all UDP packets through transparently.
#
pass in quick fastroute proto udp all
#
# Route all ICMP packets to network 10 (on le0) out through le1, to "router"
#
pass in quick on le0 to le1:router proto icmp all

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logging packets to the network

Logging packets to the network devices is supported for both packets being
passed through the filter and those being blocked. For packets being passed
on, the "dup-to" keyword must be used, but for packets being blocked, either
"to" (more efficient) or "dup-to" can be used.

To log packets to the interface without requiring ARP to work, create a
static arp cache for a meaningless IP# (say 10.0.0.1) and log packets to
this IP#.

# Log all short TCP packets to qe3, with "packetlog" as the intended
# destination for the packet.
#
block in quick to qe3:packetlog proto tcp all with short
#
# Log all connection attempts for TCP
#
pass in quick on ppp0 dup-to le1:packetlog proto tcp all flags S/SA

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule groups

To aide in making rule processing more efficient, it is possible to setup
rule `groups'. By default, all rules are in group 0 and all other groups
have it as their ultimate parent. To start a new group, a rule includes a
`head' statement, such as this:

# Process all incoming ppp packets on ppp0 with group 100, with the default for
# this interface to block all incoming.
#
block in quick on ppp0 all head 100

If we then wanted to allow people to connect to our WWW server, via ppp0, we
could then just add a rule about WWW. NOTE: only packets which match the
above rule are processed by any group 100 rules.

# Allow connections to the WWW server via ppp0.
#
pass in quick proto tcp from any to any port = WWW keep state group 100
