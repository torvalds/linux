# Three Australian stations in Antarctica have changed their time zone:
# Casey moved from UTC+8 to UTC+11

# Mawson moved from UTC+6 to UTC+5
# The changes occurred on 2009-10-18 at 02:00 (local times).

# From Steffen Thorsen (2010-03-10):
# We got these changes from the Australian Antarctic Division: ...
#
# - Casey station reverted to its normal time of UTC+8 on 5 March 2010.
# The change to UTC+11 is being considered as a regular summer thing but
# has not been decided yet.
#
# - Davis station will revert to its normal time of UTC+7 at 10 March 2010
# 20:00 UTC.
#
# - Mawson station stays on UTC+5.
#
# Background:
# https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/antartica-time-changes-2010.html

# From Steffen Thorsen (2016-10-28):
# Australian Antarctica Division informed us that Casey changed time
# zone to UTC+11 in "the morning of 22nd October 2016".

# From Steffen Thorsen (2020-10-02, as corrected):
# Based on information we have received from the Australian Antarctic
# Division, Casey station and Macquarie Island station will move to Tasmanian
# daylight savings time on Sunday 4 October. This will take effect from 0001
# hrs on Sunday 4 October 2020 and will mean Casey and Macquarie Island will
# be on the same time zone as Hobart.  Some past dates too for this 3 hour
# time change back and forth between UTC+8 and UTC+11 for Casey:
# - 2018 Oct  7 4:00 - 2019 Mar 17 3:00 - 2019 Oct  4 3:00 - 2020 Mar  8 3:00

# From Paul-Inge Flakstad (2014-03-10):
# I recently had a long dialog about this with the developer of timegenie.com.
# In the absence of specific dates, he decided to choose some likely ones:
#   GMT +1 - From March 1 to the last Sunday in March
#   GMT +2 - From the last Sunday in March until the last Sunday in October
#   GMT +1 - From the last Sunday in October until November 7
#   GMT +0 - From November 7 until March 1
# The dates for switching to and from UTC+0 will probably not be absolutely
# correct, but they should be quite close to the actual dates.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2014-03-21):
# The CET-switching Troll rules require zic from tz 2014b or later, so as
# suggested by Bengt-Inge Larsson comment them out for now, and approximate
# with only UTC and CEST.  Uncomment them when 2014b is more prevalent.

# Vostok, since 1957-12-16, temporarily closed 1994-02/1994-11
# From Craig Mundell (1994-12-15):
# http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/antarctica/QA/computers/Directions,Time,ZIP
# Vostok, which is one of the Russian stations, is set on the same
# time as Moscow, Russia.
#
# From Lee Hotz (2001-03-08):
# I queried the folks at Columbia who spent the summer at Vostok and this is
# what they had to say about time there:
# "in the US Camp (East Camp) we have been on New Zealand (McMurdo)
# time, which is 12 hours ahead of GMT. The Russian Station Vostok was
# 6 hours behind that (although only 2 miles away, i.e. 6 hours ahead
# of GMT). This is a time zone I think two hours east of Moscow. The
# natural time zone is in between the two: 8 hours ahead of GMT."
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-05-04):
# This seems to be hopelessly confusing, so I asked Lee Hotz about it
# in person.  He said that some Antarctic locations set their local
# time so that noon is the warmest part of the day, and that this
# changes during the year and does not necessarily correspond to mean
# solar noon.  So the Vostok time might have been whatever the clocks
# happened to be during their visit.  So we still don't really know what time
# it is at Vostok.
#
# From Zakhary V. Akulov (2023-12-17 22:00:48 +0700):
# ... from December, 18, 2023 00:00 by my decision the local time of
# the Antarctic research base Vostok will correspond to UTC+5.
# (2023-12-19): We constantly interact with Progress base, with company who
# builds new wintering station, with sledge convoys, with aviation - they all
# use UTC+5. Besides, difference between Moscow time is just 2 hours now, not 4.
# (2023-12-19, in response to the question "Has local time at Vostok
# been UTC+6 ever since 1957, or has it changed before?"): No. At least
# since my antarctic career start, 10 years ago, Vostok base has UTC+7.
# (In response to a 2023-12-18 question "from 02:00 to 00:00 today"): This.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2023-12-18):
# For lack of better info, guess Vostok was at +07 from founding through today,
# except when closed.

# Siple, the first commander of the South Pole station,
# stated that he would have liked to have kept GMT at the station,
# but that he found it more convenient to keep GMT+12
# as supplies for the station were coming from McMurdo Sound,
# which was on GMT+12 because New Zealand was on GMT+12 all year
# at that time (1957).  (Source: Siple's book 90° South.)
#
# From Susan Smith
# http://www.cybertours.com/whs/pole10.html
# (1995-11-13 16:24:56 +1300, no longer available):
# We use the same time as McMurdo does.
# And they use the same time as Christchurch, NZ does....
# One last quirk about South Pole time.
# All the electric clocks are usually wrong.
# Something about the generators running at 60.1hertz or something
# makes all of the clocks run fast.  So every couple of days,
# we have to go around and set them back 5 minutes or so.
# Maybe if we let them run fast all of the time, we'd get to leave here sooner!!
#
# See Pacific/Auckland.
