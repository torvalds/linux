# Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
# Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
#
# Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
# for time zone data was the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
# IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
#
# For data circa 1899, a common source is:
# Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899 Feb;13(2):173-94.
# https://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359
#
# These tables use numeric abbreviations like -03 and -0330 for
# integer hour and minute UT offsets.  Although earlier editions used
# alphabetic time zone abbreviations, these abbreviations were
# invented and did not reflect common practice.

# From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
# Argentina: first Sunday in October to first Sunday in April since 1976.
# Double Summer time from 1969 to 1974.  Switches at midnight.

# From U. S. Naval Observatory (1988-01-19):
# ARGENTINA           3 H BEHIND   UTC

# From Hernan G. Otero (1995-06-26):
# I am sending modifications to the Argentine time zone table...
# AR was chosen because they are the ISO letters that represent Argentina.

# From Peter Gradelski via Steffen Thorsen (2000-03-01):
# We just checked with our São Paulo office and they say the government of

# So Buenos Aires should be -3 hours from GMT at all times.
#
# From Fabián L. Arce Jofré (2000-04-04):
# The law that claimed DST for Argentina was derogated by President Fernando
# de la Rúa on March 2, 2000, because it would make people spend more energy
# in the winter time, rather than less.  The change took effect on March 3.
#
# From Mariano Absatz (2001-06-06):
# one of the major newspapers here in Argentina said that the 1999
# Timezone Law (which never was effectively applied) will (would?) be
# in effect.... The article is at
# http://ar.clarin.com/diario/2001-06-06/e-01701.htm
# ... The Law itself is "Ley No. 25155", sanctioned on 1999-08-25, enacted
# 1999-09-17, and published 1999-09-21.  The official publication is at:

# http://ar.clarin.com/diario/2001-06-12/s-03501.htm
#
# (2001-06-25):
# Last Friday (yes, the last working day before the date of the change), the
# Senate annulled the 1999 law that introduced the changes later postponed.
# http://www.clarin.com.ar/diario/2001-06-22/s-03601.htm
# It remains the vote of the Deputies..., but it will be the same....
# This kind of things had always been done this way in Argentina.
# We are still -03:00 all year round in all of the country.
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2007-12-21):
# A user (Leonardo Chaim) reported that Argentina will adopt DST....
# all of the country (all Zone-entries) are affected.  News reports like

#
# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2007-12-26)
# The last hurdle of Argentina DST is over, the proposal was approved in

# http://www.gobernac.mendoza.gov.ar/boletin/pdf/20040521-27158-normas.pdf
# From Paul Eggert (2004-05-24):
# It's Law No. 7,210.  This change is due to a public power emergency, so for
# now we'll assume it's for this year only.

# Hora de verano para la República Argentina
# http://buenasiembra.com.ar/esoterismo/astrologia/hora-de-verano-de-la-republica-argentina-27.html
# says that standard time in Argentina from 1894-10-31
# to 1920-05-01 was -4:16:48.25.  Go with this more precise value
# over Shanks & Pottenger.  It is upward compatible with Milne, who
# says Córdoba time was -4:16:48.2.

#
# From Mariano Absatz (2004-06-05):
# These media articles from a major newspaper mostly cover the current state:
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/05/27/de_604825.asp
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/05/28/de_605203.asp
#
# The following eight (8) provinces pulled clocks back to UTC-04:00 at
# midnight Monday May 31st. (that is, the night between 05/31 and 06/01).
# Apparently, all nine provinces would go back to UTC-03:00 at the same
# time in October 17th.
#
# Catamarca, Chubut, La Rioja, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Cruz,
# Tierra del Fuego, Tucumán.
#
# From Mariano Absatz (2004-06-14):
# ... this weekend, the Province of Tucumán decided it'd go back to UTC-03:00
# yesterday midnight (that is, at 24:00 Saturday 12th), since the people's
# annoyance with the change is much higher than the power savings obtained....
#
# From Gwillim Law (2004-06-14):
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/06/10/de_609078.asp ...
#     "The time change in Tierra del Fuego was a conflicted decision from
#   the start.  The government had decreed that the measure would take
#   effect on June 1, but a normative error forced the new time to begin
#   three days earlier, from a Saturday to a Sunday....
# Our understanding was that the change was originally scheduled to take place
# on June 1 at 00:00 in Chubut, Santa Cruz, Tierra del Fuego (and some other
# provinces).  Sunday was May 30, only two days earlier.  So the article
# contains a contradiction.  I would give more credence to the Saturday/Sunday
# date than the "three days earlier" phrase, and conclude that Tierra del
# Fuego set its clocks back at 2004-05-30 00:00.
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2004-10-05):
# The previous law 7210 which changed the province of Mendoza's time zone
# back in May have been modified slightly in a new law 7277, which set the
# new end date to 2004-09-26 (original date was 2004-10-17).

#
# From Mariano Absatz (2004-10-05):
# San Juan changed from UTC-03:00 to UTC-04:00 at midnight between

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-01-17):
# Here are articles that Argentina Province San Luis is planning to end DST
# as earlier as upcoming Monday January 21, 2008 or February 2008:
#
# Provincia argentina retrasa reloj y marca diferencia con resto del país
# (Argentine Province delayed clock and mark difference with the rest of the
# country)
# http://cl.invertia.com/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=200801171849_EFE_ET4373&idtel
#
# Es inminente que en San Luis atrasen una hora los relojes

# https://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/253414/Economia/Es-inminente-que-en-San-Luis-atrasen-una-hora-los-relojes.html
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_argentina02.html

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-01-18):
# The page of the San Luis provincial government
# http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/notas.asp?idCanal=0&id=22812
# confirms what Alex Krivenyshev has earlier sent to the tz
# emailing list about that San Luis plans to return to standard
# time much earlier than the rest of the country. It also
# confirms that upon request the provinces San Juan and Mendoza
# refused to follow San Luis in this change.
#
# The change is supposed to take place Monday the 21st at 0:00
# hours. As far as I understand it if this goes ahead, we need
# a new timezone for San Luis (although there are also documented
# independent changes in the southamerica file of San Luis in
# 1990 and 1991 which has not been confirmed).

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-01-25):
# Unfortunately the below page has become defunct, about the San Luis
# time change. Perhaps because it now is part of a group of pages "Most
# important pages of 2008."
#
# You can use
# http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/notas.asp?idCanal=8141&id=22834
# instead it seems. Or use "Buscador" from the main page of the San Luis
# government, and fill in "huso" and click OK, and you will get 3 pages
# from which the first one is identical to the above.

# From Mariano Absatz (2008-01-28):
# I can confirm that the Province of San Luis (and so far only that
# province) decided to go back to UTC-3 effective midnight Jan 20th 2008
# (that is, Monday 21st at 0:00 is the time the clocks were delayed back
# 1 hour), and they intend to keep UTC-3 as their timezone all year round
# (that is, unless they change their mind any minute now).
#
# So we'll have to add yet another city to 'southamerica' (I think San
# Luis city is the mos populated city in the Province, so it'd be
# America/Argentina/San_Luis... of course I can't remember if San Luis's
# history of particular changes goes along with Mendoza or San Juan :-(
# (I only remember not being able to collect hard facts about San Luis
# back in 2004, when these provinces changed to UTC-4 for a few days, I
# mailed them personally and never got an answer).

# From Paul Eggert (2014-08-12):
# Unless otherwise specified, data entries are from Shanks & Pottenger through
# 1992, from the IATA otherwise.  As noted below, Shanks & Pottenger say that
# America/Cordoba split into 6 subregions during 1991/1992, one of which
# was America/San_Luis, but we haven't verified this yet so for now we'll
# keep America/Cordoba a single region rather than splitting it into the
# other 5 subregions.

# From Mariano Absatz (2009-03-13):
# Yesterday (with our usual 2-day notice) the Province of San Luis
# decided that next Sunday instead of "staying" @utc-03:00 they will go
# to utc-04:00 until the second Saturday in October...
#
# The press release is at
# http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/SL/Paginas/NoticiaDetalle.asp?TemaId=1&InfoPrensaId=3102
# (I couldn't find the decree, but www.sanluis.gov.ar
# is the official page for the Province Government.)
#
# There's also a note in only one of the major national papers ...
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1107912
#
# The press release says [quick and dirty translation]:
# ... announced that next Sunday, at 00:00, Puntanos (the San Luis
# inhabitants) will have to turn back one hour their clocks
#
# Since then, San Luis will establish its own Province timezone. Thus,
# during 2009, this timezone change will run from 00:00 the third Sunday
# in March until 24:00 of the second Saturday in October.

# From Mariano Absatz (2009-10-16):
# ...the Province of San Luis is a case in itself.
#
# The Law at
# http://www.diputadossanluis.gov.ar/diputadosasp/paginas/verNorma.asp?NormaID=276
# is ambiguous because establishes a calendar from the 2nd Sunday in
# October at 0:00 thru the 2nd Saturday in March at 24:00 and the
# complement of that starting on the 2nd Sunday of March at 0:00 and
# ending on the 2nd Saturday of March at 24:00.
#
# This clearly breaks every time the 1st of March or October is a Sunday.
#
# IMHO, the "spirit of the Law" is to make the changes at 0:00 on the 2nd
# Sunday of October and March.
#
# The problem is that the changes in the rest of the Provinces that did
# change in 2007/2008, were made according to the Federal Law and Decrees
# that did so on the 3rd Sunday of October and March.
#
# In fact, San Luis actually switched from UTC-4 to UTC-3 last Sunday
# (October 11th) at 0:00.
#
# So I guess a new set of rules, besides "Arg", must be made and the last
# America/Argentina/San_Luis entries should change to use these...
# ...

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2010-04-09):
# According to news reports from El Diario de la República Province San
# Luis, Argentina (standard time UTC-04) will keep Daylight Saving Time
# after April 11, 2010 - will continue to have same time as rest of
# Argentina (UTC-3) (no DST).
#
# Confirmaron la prórroga del huso horario de verano (Spanish)

# or (some English translation):
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_argentina08.html

# From Mariano Absatz (2010-04-12):
# yes...I can confirm this...and given that San Luis keeps calling
# UTC-03:00 "summer time", we should't just let San Luis go back to "Arg"
# rules...San Luis is still using "Western ARgentina Time" and it got
# stuck on Summer daylight savings time even though the summer is over.

# From Paul Eggert (2018-01-23):
# Perhaps San Luis operates on the legal fiction that it is at -04
# with perpetual daylight saving time, but ordinary usage typically seems to
# just say it's at -03; see, for example,
# https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hora_oficial_argentina
# We've documented similar situations as being plain changes to
# standard time, so let's do that here too.  This does not change UTC
# offsets, only tm_isdst and the time zone abbreviations.  One minor
# plus is that this silences a zic complaint that there's no POSIX TZ
# setting for timestamps past 2038.

# Brazil

# From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):
# The mayor of Rio recently attempted to change the time zone rules
# just in his city, in order to leave more summer time for the tourist trade.
# The rule change lasted only part of the day;
# the federal government refused to follow the city's rules, and business
# was in a chaos, so the mayor backed down that afternoon.

# From IATA SSIM (1996-02):
# _Only_ the following states in BR1 observe DST: Rio Grande do Sul (RS),
# Santa Catarina (SC), Paraná (PR), São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ),
# Espírito Santo (ES), Minas Gerais (MG), Bahia (BA), Goiás (GO),
# Distrito Federal (DF), Tocantins (TO), Sergipe [SE] and Alagoas [AL].
# [The last three states are new to this issue of the IATA SSIM.]

# From Gwillim Law (1996-10-07):
# Geography, history (Tocantins was part of Goiás until 1989), and other
# sources of time zone information lead me to believe that AL, SE, and TO were
# always in BR1, and so the only change was whether or not they observed DST....
# The earliest issue of the SSIM I have is 2/91.  Each issue from then until
# 9/95 says that DST is observed only in the ten states I quoted from 9/95,
# along with Mato Grosso (MT) and Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), which are in BR2
# (UTC-4)....  The other two time zones given for Brazil are BR3, which is
# UTC-5, no DST, and applies only in the state of Acre (AC); and BR4, which is
# UTC-2, and applies to Fernando de Noronha (formerly FN, but I believe it's
# become part of the state of Pernambuco).  The boundary between BR1 and BR2
# has never been clearly stated.  They've simply been called East and West.
# However, some conclusions can be drawn from another IATA manual: the Airline
# Coding Directory, which lists close to 400 airports in Brazil.  For each
# airport it gives a time zone which is coded to the SSIM.  From that
# information, I'm led to conclude that the states of Amapá (AP), Ceará (CE),
# Maranhão (MA), Paraíba (PR), Pernambuco (PE), Piauí (PI), and Rio Grande do
# Norte (RN), and the eastern part of Pará (PA) are all in BR1 without DST.

# From Marcos Tadeu (1998-09-27):
# Brazilian official page <http://pcdsh01.on.br/verao1.html>

# From Jesper Nørgaard (2000-11-03):
# [For an official list of which regions in Brazil use which time zones, see:]
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/Fusbr.htm
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/Fusbrhv.htm

# From Celso Doria via David Madeo (2002-10-09):
# The reason for the delay this year has to do with elections in Brazil.
#
# Unlike in the United States, elections in Brazil are 100% computerized and
# the results are known almost immediately.  Yesterday, it was the first
# round of the elections when 115 million Brazilians voted for President,
# Governor, Senators, Federal Deputies, and State Deputies.  Nobody is
# counting (or re-counting) votes anymore and we know there will be a second
# round for the Presidency and also for some Governors.  The 2nd round will
# take place on October 27th.
#
# The reason why the DST will only begin November 3rd is that the thousands
# of electoral machines used cannot have their time changed, and since the
# Constitution says the elections must begin at 8:00 AM and end at 5:00 PM,
# the Government decided to postpone DST, instead of changing the Constitution
# (maybe, for the next elections, it will be possible to change the clock)...

# From Rodrigo Severo (2004-10-04):
# It's just the biannual change made necessary by the much hyped, supposedly
# modern Brazilian ... voting machines which, apparently, can't deal
# with a time change between the first and the second rounds of the elections.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2007-09-20):
# Brazil will start DST on 2007-10-14 00:00 and end on 2008-02-17 00:00:
# http://www.mme.gov.br/site/news/detail.do;jsessionid=BBA06811AFCAAC28F0285210913513DA?newsId=13975

# From Paul Schulze (2008-06-24):
# ...by law number 11.662 of April 24, 2008 (published in the "Diario
# Oficial da União"...) in Brazil there are changes in the timezones,
# effective today (00:00am at June 24, 2008) as follows:
#
# a) The timezone UTC+5 is extinguished, with all the Acre state and the
# part of the Amazonas state that had this timezone now being put to the
# timezone UTC+4
# b) The whole Pará state now is put at timezone UTC+3, instead of just
# part of it, as was before.
#
# This change follows a proposal of senator Tiao Viana of Acre state, that
# proposed it due to concerns about open television channels displaying
# programs inappropriate to youths in the states that had the timezone
# UTC+5 too early in the night. In the occasion, some more corrections
# were proposed, trying to unify the timezones of any given state. This
# change modifies timezone rules defined in decree 2.784 of 18 June,
# 1913.

# From Rodrigo Severo (2008-06-24):
# Just correcting the URL:
# https://www.in.gov.br/imprensa/visualiza/index.jsp?jornal=do&secao=1&pagina=1&data=25/04/2008
#
# As a result of the above Decree I believe the America/Rio_Branco
# timezone shall be modified from UTC-5 to UTC-4 and a new timezone shall
# be created to represent the...west side of the Pará State. I
# suggest this new timezone be called Santarem as the most
# important/populated city in the affected area.
#
# This new timezone would be the same as the Rio_Branco timezone up to
# the 2008/06/24 change which would be to UTC-3 instead of UTC-4.

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-06-24):
# This is a quick reference page for New and Old Brazil Time Zones map.
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/brazil-time-new-old.php
#
# - 4 time zones replaced by 3 time zones - eliminating time zone UTC-05
# (state Acre and the part of the Amazonas will be UTC/GMT-04) - western
# part of Par state is moving to one timezone UTC-03 (from UTC-04).

# From Paul Eggert (2002-10-10):
# The official decrees referenced below are mostly taken from
# Decretos sobre o Horário de Verão no Brasil.
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/DecHV.html

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-08-29):
# As announced by the government and many newspapers in Brazil late
# yesterday, Brazil will start DST on 2008-10-19 (need to change rule) and
# it will end on 2009-02-15 (current rule for Brazil is fine). Based on
# past years experience with the elections, there was a good chance that
# the start was postponed to November, but it did not happen this year.

# The announcement was made by Governor Jaques Wagner in an interview to a

# From Guilherme Bernardes Rodrigues (2011-10-07):
# There is news in the media, however there is still no decree about it.
# I just send a e-mail to Zulmira Brandao at http://pcdsh01.on.br/ the
# official agency about time in Brazil, and she confirmed that the old rule is
# still in force.

# From Guilherme Bernardes Rodrigues (2011-10-14)
# It's official, the President signed a decree that includes Bahia in summer
# time.
#	 [ and in a second message (same day): ]
# I found the decree.

# Senator Jorge Viana announced that Acre will change time zone on November 10.
# He did not specify the time of the change, nor if western parts of Amazonas
# will change as well.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2013-10-17):
# For now, assume western Amazonas will change as well.

# From Daniel C. Sobral (1998-02-12):
# In 1997, the DS began on October 6. The stated reason was that
# because international television networks ignored Brazil's policy on DS,
# they bought the wrong times on satellite for coverage of Pope's visit.
# This year, the ending date of DS was postponed to March 1
# to help dealing with the shortages of electric power.

# Chile

# From Paul Eggert (2022-03-15):
# Shanks & Pottenger says America/Santiago introduced standard time in
# 1890 and rounds its UT offset to 70W40; guess that in practice this
# was the same offset as in 1916-1919.  It also says Pacific/Easter
# standardized on 109W22 in 1890; assume this didn't change the clocks.
#
# Dates for America/Santiago from 1910 to 2004 are primarily from
# the following source, cited by Oscar van Vlijmen (2006-10-08):
# [1] Chile Law
# http://www.webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/chile.html
# This contains a copy of this official table:
# Cambios en la hora oficial de Chile desde 1900 (retrieved 2008-03-30)
# https://web.archive.org/web/20080330200901/http://www.horaoficial.cl/cambio.htm
# [1] needs several corrections, though.
#
# The first set of corrections is from:
# [2] History of the Official Time of Chile
# http://www.horaoficial.cl/ing/horaof_ing.html (retrieved 2012-03-06).  See:
# https://web.archive.org/web/20120306042032/http://www.horaoficial.cl/ing/horaof_ing.html
# This is an English translation of:
# Historia de la hora oficial de Chile (retrieved 2012-10-24).  See:
# https://web.archive.org/web/20121024234627/http://www.horaoficial.cl/horaof.htm
# A fancier Spanish version (requiring mouse-clicking) is at:
# http://www.horaoficial.cl/historia_hora.php
# Conflicts between [1] and [2] were resolved as follows:
#
#  - [1] says the 1910 transition was Jan 1, [2] says Jan 10 and cites
#    Boletín No. 1, Aviso No. 1 (1910).  Go with [2].
#
#  - [1] says SMT was -4:42:45, [2] says Chile's official time from
#    1916 to 1919 was -4:42:46.3, the meridian of Chile's National
#    Astronomical Observatory (OAN), then located in what is now
#    Quinta Normal in Santiago.  Go with [1], as this matches the meridian
#    referred to by the relevant Chilean laws to this day.
#
#  - [1] says the 1918 transition was Sep 1, [2] says Sep 10 and cites
#    Boletín No. 22, Aviso No. 129/1918 (1918-08-23).  Go with [2].
#
#  - [1] does not give times for transitions; assume they occur
#    at midnight mainland time, the current common practice.  However,
#    go with [2]'s specification of 23:00 for the 1947-05-21 transition.
#
# Another correction to [1] is from Jesper Nørgaard Welen, who
# wrote (2006-10-08), "I think that there are some obvious mistakes in
# the suggested link from Oscar van Vlijmen,... for instance entry 66
# says that GMT-4 ended 1990-09-12 while entry 67 only begins GMT-3 at
# 1990-09-15 (they should have been 1990-09-15 and 1990-09-16
# respectively), but anyhow it clears up some doubts too."
#
# Data for Pacific/Easter from 1910 through 1967 come from Shanks &
# Pottenger.  After that, for lack of better info assume
# Pacific/Easter is always two hours behind America/Santiago;
# this is known to work for DST transitions starting in 2008 and
# may well be true for earlier transitions.

# From Tim Parenti (2022-07-06):
# For a brief period of roughly six weeks in 1946, DST was only observed on an
# emergency basis in specific regions of central Chile; namely, "the national
# territory between the provinces of Coquimbo and Concepción, inclusive".
# This was enacted by Decree 3,891, dated 1946-07-13, and took effect
# 1946-07-14 24:00, advancing these central regions to -03.
# https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/versiones-anteriores/do-h/19460715/#page/1
# The decree contemplated "[t]hat this advancement of the Official Time, even
# though it has been proposed for the cities of Santiago and Valparaíso only,
# must be agreed with that of other cities, due to the connection of various
# activities that require it, such as, for example, the operation of rail
# services".  It was originally set to expire after 30 days but was extended
# through 1946-08-31 by Decree 4,506, dated 1946-08-13.
# https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/versiones-anteriores/do-h/19460814/#page/1
#
# Law Number 8,522, promulgated 1946-08-27, reunified Chilean clocks at their
# new "Summer Time" of -04, reckoned as that of "the meridian of the
# Astronomical Observatory of Lo Espejo, advanced by 42 minutes and 45
# seconds".  Although this law specified the new Summer Time to start on 1
# September each year, a special "transitional article" started it a few days
# early, as soon as the law took effect.  As the law was to take force "from
# the date of its publication in the 'Diario Oficial', which happened the
# following day, presume the change took place in Santiago and its environs
# from 24:00 -03 to 23:00 -04 on Wednesday 1946-08-28.  Although this was a
# no-op for wall clocks in the north and south of the country, put their formal
# start to DST an hour later when they reached 24:00 -04.
# https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/versiones-anteriores/do-h/19460828/#page/1
# After a brief "Winter Time" stint at -05 beginning 1947-04-01, Law Number
# 8,777, promulgated 1947-05-17, established year-round -04 "from 23:00 on the
# second day after it is published in the 'Diario Oficial'."  It was published
# on Monday 1947-05-19 and so took effect from Wednesday 1947-05-21 23:00.
# https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/versiones-anteriores/do-h/19470519/#page/1

# From Eduardo Krell (1995-10-19):
# The law says to switch to DST at midnight [24:00] on the second SATURDAY
# of October....  The law is the same for March and October.
# (1998-09-29):
# Because of the drought this year, the government decided to go into
# DST earlier (saturday 9/26 at 24:00). This is a one-time change only ...
# (unless there's another dry season next year, I guess).

# From Julio I. Pacheco Troncoso (1999-03-18):
# Because of the same drought, the government decided to end DST later,
# on April 3, (one-time change).

# From Germán Poo-Caamaño (2008-03-03):
# Due to drought, Chile extends Daylight Time in three weeks.  This
# is one-time change (Saturday 3/29 at 24:00 for America/Santiago
# and Saturday 3/29 at 22:00 for Pacific/Easter)

# Subject: DST in Chile exceptionally extended to 3 April due to earthquake
# http://www.gobiernodechile.cl/viewNoticia.aspx?idArticulo=30098
#
# From Arthur David Olson (2010-03-06):
# Angel Chiang's message confirmed by Julio Pacheco; Julio provided a patch.

# From Glenn Eychaner (2011-03-28):
# http://diario.elmercurio.com/2011/03/28/_portada/_portada/noticias/7565897A-CA86-49E6-9E03-660B21A4883E.htm?id=3D{7565897A-CA86-49E6-9E03-660B21A4883E}
# In English:
# Chile's clocks will go back an hour this year on the 7th of May instead

# August, not in October as they have since 1968.

# From Mauricio Parada (2012-02-22), translated by Glenn Eychaner (2012-02-23):
# As stated in the website of the Chilean Energy Ministry
# http://www.minenergia.cl/ministerio/noticias/generales/gobierno-anuncia-fechas-de-cambio-de.html
# The Chilean Government has decided to postpone the entrance into winter time
# (to leave DST) from March 11 2012 to April 28th 2012....
# Quote from the website communication:
#
# 6. For the year 2012, the dates of entry into winter time will be as follows:
# a. Saturday April 28, 2012, clocks should go back 60 minutes; that is, at
# 23:59:59, instead of passing to 0:00, the time should be adjusted to be 23:00
# of the same day.
# b. Saturday, September 1, 2012, clocks should go forward 60 minutes; that is,
# at 23:59:59, instead of passing to 0:00, the time should be adjusted to be
# 01:00 on September 2.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-02-15):
# According to several news sources, Chile has extended DST this year,
# they will end DST later and start DST earlier than planned.  They
# hope to save energy.  The new end date is 2013-04-28 00:00 and new
# start date is 2013-09-08 00:00....

# From Juan Correa (2016-03-18):
# The decree regarding DST has been published in today's Official Gazette...

# this scheme will stick.
# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):

# Falklands

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Between 1990 and 2000 inclusive, Shanks & Pottenger and the IATA agree except
# the IATA gives 1996-09-08.  Go with Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Falkland Islands Government Office, London (2001-01-22)
# via Jesper Nørgaard:
# ... the clocks revert back to Local Mean Time at 2 am on Sunday 15
# April 2001 and advance one hour to summer time at 2 am on Sunday 2
# September.  It is anticipated that the clocks will revert back at 2
# am on Sunday 21 April 2002 and advance to summer time at 2 am on
# Sunday 1 September.

# From Rives McDow (2001-02-13):
#
# I have communicated several times with people there, and the last
# time I had communications that was helpful was in 1998.  Here is
# what was said then:
#
# "The general rule was that Stanley used daylight saving and the Camp
# did not. However for various reasons many people in the Camp have
# started to use daylight saving (known locally as 'Stanley Time')
# There is no rule as to who uses daylight saving - it is a matter of
# personal choice and so it is impossible to draw a map showing who
# uses it and who does not. Any list would be out of date as soon as
# it was produced. This year daylight saving ended on April 18/19th
# and started again on September 12/13th.  I do not know what the rule
# is, but can find out if you like.  We do not change at the same time
# as UK or Chile."
#
# I did have in my notes that the rule was "Second Saturday in Sep at
# 0:00 until third Saturday in Apr at 0:00".  I think that this does
# not agree in some cases with Shanks; is this true?
#
# Also, there is no mention in the list that some areas in the
# Falklands do not use DST.  I have found in my communications there
# that these areas are on the western half of East Falkland and all of
# West Falkland.  Stanley is the only place that consistently observes
# DST.  Again, as in other places in the world, the farmers don't like
# it.  West Falkland is almost entirely sheep farmers.
#
# I know one lady there that keeps a list of which farm keeps DST and
# which doesn't each year.  She runs a shop in Stanley, and says that
# the list changes each year.  She uses it to communicate to her
# customers, catching them when they are home for lunch or dinner.

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-05):
# For now, we'll just record the time in Stanley, since we have no
# better info.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2011-04-01):
# The Falkland Islands will not turn back clocks this winter, but stay on
# daylight saving time.
#
# One source:
# http://www.falklandnews.com/public/story.cfm?get=5914&source=3
#
# We have gotten this confirmed by a clerk of the legislative assembly:
# Normally the clocks revert to Local Mean Time (UTC/GMT -4 hours) on the
# third Sunday of April at 0200hrs and advance to Summer Time (UTC/GMT -3
# hours) on the first Sunday of September at 0200hrs.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: During 2011, on a trial basis, the Falkland Islands
# will not revert to local mean time, but clocks will remain on Summer
# time (UTC/GMT - 3 hours) throughout the whole of 2011.  Any long term
# change to local time following the trial period will be notified.
#
# From Andrew Newman (2012-02-24)
# A letter from Justin McPhee, Chief Executive,
# Cable & Wireless Falkland Islands (dated 2012-02-22)
# states...
#   The current Atlantic/Stanley entry under South America expects the
#   clocks to go back to standard Falklands Time (FKT) on the 15th April.
#   The database entry states that in 2011 Stanley was staying on fixed
#   summer time on a trial basis only.  FIG need to contact IANA and/or
#   the maintainers of the database to inform them we're adopting
#   the same policy this year and suggest recommendations for future years.
#
# For now we will assume permanent -03 for the Falklands
# until advised differently (to apply for 2012 and beyond, after the 2011

# https://www.gacetaoficial.gov.py/index/detalle_publicacion/89723
# The text of the law says that it enters into force on the first
# Sunday in October 2024 (6 October 2024).  But the constitution
# prohibits retroactive effect, and the civil code says that laws
# enter into force on the day after their publication or on the day
# that they specify, and it also says that they don't have retroactive
# effect.  So I think that the time change on 6 October 2024 should
# still be considered as DST according to the previous law, and
# permanently UTC-3 from 15 October 2024 according to the new law....

# Uruguay

# Uruguay wins the prize for the strangest peacetime manipulation of the rules.
#
# From Tim Parenti (2018-02-20), per Jeremie Bonjour (2018-01-31) and Michael
# Deckers (2018-02-20):
# ... At least they kept good records...
#
# http://www.armada.mil.uy/ContenidosPDFs/sohma/web/almanaque/almanaque_2018.pdf#page=36
# Page 36 of Almanaque 2018, published by the Oceanography, Hydrography, and
# Meteorology Service of the Uruguayan Navy, seems to give many transitions
# with greater clarity than we've had before.  It directly references many laws
# and decrees which are, in turn, referenced below.  They can be viewed in the
# public archives of the Diario Oficial (in Spanish) at
# http://www.impo.com.uy/diariooficial/
#
# Ley No. 3920 of 1908-06-10 placed the determination of legal time under the
# auspices of the National Institute for the Prediction of Time.  It is unclear
# exactly what offset was used during this period, though Ley No. 7200 of
# 1920-04-23 used the Observatory of the National Meteorological Institute in
# Montevideo (34° 54' 33" S, 56° 12' 45" W) as its reference meridian,
# retarding legal time by 15 minutes 9 seconds from 1920-04-30 24:00,
# resulting in UT-04.  Assume the corresponding LMT of UT-03:44:51 (given on
# page 725 of the Proceedings of the Second Pan-American Scientific Congress,
# 1915-1916) was in use, and merely became official from 1908-06-10.
# https://www.impo.com.uy/diariooficial/1908/06/18/12
# https://www.impo.com.uy/diariooficial/1920/04/27/9
#
# Ley No. 7594 of 1923-06-28 specified legal time as Observatory time advanced
# by 44 minutes 51 seconds (UT-03) "from 30 September to 31 March", and by 14
# minutes 51 seconds (UT-03:30) "the rest of the year"; a message from the
# National Council of Administration the same day, published directly below the
# law in the Diario Oficial, specified the first transition to be 1923-09-30
# 24:00.  This effectively established standard time at UT-03:30 with 30
# minutes DST.  Assume transitions at 24:00 on the specified days until Ley No.
# 7919 of 1926-03-05 ended this arrangement, repealing all "laws and other
# provisions which oppose" it, resulting in year-round UT-03:30; a Resolución
# of 1926-03-11 puts the final transition at 1926-03-31 24:00, the same as it
# would have been under the previous law.

#
# It appears Ley No. 9122 of 1933 was never published as such in the Diario
# Oficial, but instead appeared as Document 26 in the Diario on Friday
# 1933-10-27 as a decree made Monday 1933-10-23 and filed under the Ministry of
# National Defense.  It reinstituted a DST of 30 minutes (to UT-03) "from the
# last Sunday of October...until the last Saturday of March."  In accordance
# with this provision, the first transition was explicitly specified in Article
# 2 of the decree as Saturday 1933-10-28 at 24:00; that is, Sunday 1933-10-29
# at 00:00.  Assume transitions at 00:00 Sunday throughout.
#
# Departing from the matter-of-fact nature of previous timekeeping laws, the
# 1933 decree "consider[s] the advantages of...the advance of legal time":
#
#   "Whereas: The measure adopted by almost all nations at the time of the last
#    World War still persists in North America and Europe, precisely because of
#    the economic, hygienic, and social advantages derived from such an
#    emergency measure...
#
#    Whereas: The advance of the legal time during the summer seasons, by
#    displacing social activity near sunrise, favors the citizen populations
#    and especially the society that creates and works..."
#
# It further specified that "necessary measures" be taken to ensure that
# "public spectacles finish, in general, before [01:00]."

# From Tim Parenti (2018-02-15):
# Most of the Rules below, and their contemporaneous Zone lines, have been
# updated simply to match the Almanaque 2018.  Although the document does not
# list exact transition times, midnight transitions were already present in our
# data here for all transitions through 2004-09, and this is both consistent
# with prior transitions and verified in several decrees marked below between
# 1939-09 and 2004-09, wherein the relevant text was typically of the form:
#
#   "From 0 hours on [date], the legal time of the entire Republic will be...
#
#    In accordance with [the preceding], on [previous date] at 24 hours, all
#    clocks throughout the Republic will be [advanced/retarded] by..."
#
# It is possible that there is greater specificity to be found for the Rules
# below, but it is buried in no fewer than 40 different decrees individually
# referenced by the Almanaque for the period from 1939-09 to 2014-09.
# Four-fifths of these were promulgated less than two weeks before taking
