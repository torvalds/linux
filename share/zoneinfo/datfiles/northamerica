# United States

# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
# Howse writes (pp 121-125) that time zones were invented by
# Professor Charles Ferdinand Dowd (1825-1904),
# Principal of Temple Grove Ladies' Seminary (Saratoga Springs, NY).
# His pamphlet "A System of National Time for Railroads" (1870)
# was the result of his proposals at the Convention of Railroad Trunk Lines
# in New York City (1869-10).  His 1870 proposal was based on Washington, DC,
# but in 1872-05 he moved the proposed origin to Greenwich.

# From Paul Eggert (2024-11-18):
# Dowd's proposal left many details unresolved, such as where to draw
# lines between time zones.  Sandford Fleming of the Canadian Pacific Railway
# argued for Dowd's proposal in 1876, and Cleveland Abbe of the American
# Meteorology Society published a report in 1879 recommending four US time
# zones based on GMT.  However, the key individual who made time zones
# work in the US was William Frederick Allen - railway engineer,
# managing editor of the Travelers' Guide, and secretary of the
# General Time Convention, a railway standardization group.  Allen
# spent months in dialogs with scientific and railway leaders,
# developed a workable plan to institute time zones, and presented it
# to the General Time Convention on 1883-04-11, saying that his plan
# meant "local time would be practically abolished" - a plus for
# railway scheduling.  By the next convention on 1883-10-11 nearly all
# railroads had agreed and it took effect on 1883-11-18.  That Sunday
# was called the "day of two noons", as some locations observed noon
# twice.  Allen witnessed the transition in New York City, writing:
#
#   I heard the bells of St. Paul's strike on the old time.  Four
#   minutes later, obedient to the electrical signal from the Naval
#   Observatory ... the time-ball made its rapid descent, the chimes
#   of old Trinity rang twelve measured strokes, and local time was
#   abandoned, probably forever.
#
# Most of the US soon followed suit.  See:
# Bartky IR. The adoption of standard time. Technol Cult 1989 Jan;30(1):25-56.
# https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3105430

# From Paul Eggert (2005-04-16):
# That 1883 transition occurred at 12:00 new time, not at 12:00 old time.
# See p 46 of David Prerau, Seize the daylight, Thunder's Mouth Press (2005).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# A good source for time zone historical data in the US is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The American Atlas (5th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).
# Make sure you have the errata sheet; the book is somewhat useless without it.
# It is the source for most of the pre-1991 US entries below.

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Daylight Saving Time was first suggested as a joke by Benjamin Franklin
# in his whimsical essay "An Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost
# of Light" published in the Journal de Paris (1784-04-26).
# Not everyone is happy with the results:
#
#	I don't really care how time is reckoned so long as there is some
#	agreement about it, but I object to being told that I am saving
#	daylight when my reason tells me that I am doing nothing of the kind.
#	I even object to the implication that I am wasting something
#	valuable if I stay in bed after the sun has risen.  As an admirer
#	of moonlight I resent the bossy insistence of those who want to
#	reduce my time for enjoying it.  At the back of the Daylight Saving
#	scheme I detect the bony, blue-fingered hand of Puritanism, eager
#	to push people into bed earlier, and get them up earlier, to make
#	them healthy, wealthy and wise in spite of themselves.
#

#
# Shanks says that DST was called "War Time" in the US in 1918 and 1919.
# However, DST was imposed by the Standard Time Act of 1918, which
# was the first nationwide legal time standard, and apparently
# time was just called "Standard Time" or "Daylight Saving Time".

# From Paul Eggert (2019-06-04):
# Here is the legal basis for the US federal rules.
# * Public Law 65-106 (1918-03-19) implemented standard and daylight saving
#   time for the first time across the US, springing forward on March's last
#   Sunday and falling back on October's last Sunday.
#   https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/65th-congress/session-2/c65s2ch24.pdf
# * Public Law 66-40 (1919-08-20) repealed DST on October 1919's last Sunday.
#   https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/66th-congress/session-1/c66s1ch51.pdf
# * Public Law 77-403 (1942-01-20) started wartime DST on 1942-02-09.
#   https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/77th-congress/session-2/c77s2ch7.pdf
# * Public Law 79-187 (1945-09-25) ended wartime DST on 1945-09-30.
#   https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/79th-congress/session-1/c79s1ch388.pdf
# * Public Law 89-387 (1966-04-13) reinstituted a national standard for DST,
#   from April's last Sunday to October's last Sunday, effective 1967.
#   https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-80/pdf/STATUTE-80-Pg107.pdf
# * Public Law 93-182 (1973-12-15) moved the 1974 spring-forward to 01-06.
#   https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-87/pdf/STATUTE-87-Pg707.pdf
# * Public Law 93-434 (1974-10-05) moved the 1975 spring-forward to
#   February's last Sunday.
#   https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-88/pdf/STATUTE-88-Pg1209.pdf
# * Public Law 99-359 (1986-07-08) moved the spring-forward to April's first
#   Sunday.
#   https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-100/pdf/STATUTE-100-Pg764.pdf
# * Public Law 109-58 (2005-08-08), effective 2007, moved the spring-forward
#   to March's second Sunday and the fall-back to November's first Sunday.

# All transitions are at 02:00 local time.

# From Arthur David Olson:
# Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of
# Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.

# From Arthur David Olson (2000-09-25):
# Last night I heard part of a rebroadcast of a 1945 Arch Oboler radio drama.
# In the introduction, Oboler spoke of "Eastern Peace Time."
# An AltaVista search turned up:
# https://web.archive.org/web/20000926032210/http://rowayton.org/rhs/hstaug45.html
# "When the time is announced over the radio now, it is 'Eastern Peace
# Time' instead of the old familiar 'Eastern War Time.'  Peace is wonderful."
# (August 1945) by way of confirmation.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-09-23):
# This was the V-J Day issue of the Clamdigger, a Rowayton, CT newsletter.

# From Joseph Gallant citing
# George H. Douglas, _The Early Days of Radio Broadcasting_ (1987):
# At 7 P.M. (Eastern War Time) [on 1945-08-14], the networks were set
# to switch to London for Attlee's address, but the American people
# never got to hear his speech live. According to one press account,
# CBS' Bob Trout was first to announce the word of Japan's surrender,
# but a few seconds later, NBC, ABC and Mutual also flashed the word
# of surrender, all of whom interrupting the bells of Big Ben in
# London which were to precede Mr. Attlee's speech.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-02-09): It was Robert St John, not Bob Trout.  From
# Myrna Oliver's obituary of St John on page B16 of today's Los Angeles Times:
#
# ... a war-weary U.S. clung to radios, awaiting word of Japan's surrender.
# Any announcement from Asia would reach St. John's New York newsroom on a
# wire service teletype machine, which had prescribed signals for major news.
# Associated Press, for example, would ring five bells before spewing out
# typed copy of an important story, and 10 bells for news "of transcendental
# importance."
#
# On Aug. 14, stalling while talking steadily into the NBC networks' open
# microphone, St. John heard five bells and waited only to hear a sixth bell,
# before announcing confidently: "Ladies and gentlemen, World War II is over.
# The Japanese have agreed to our surrender terms."
#
# He had scored a 20-second scoop on other broadcasters.

# From Arthur David Olson (2005-08-22):
# Paul has been careful to use the "US" rules only in those locations
# that are part of the United States; this reflects the real scope of
# U.S. government action.  So even though the "US" rules have changed
# in the latest release, other countries won't be affected.

# Although the 1918 names were officially "United States Standard

# From Dave Cantor (2004-11-02):
# Early this summer I had the occasion to visit the Mount Washington
# Observatory weather station atop (of course!) Mount Washington [, NH]....
# One of the staff members said that the station was on Eastern Standard Time
# and didn't change their clocks for Daylight Saving ... so that their
# reports will always have times which are 5 hours behind UTC.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-08-26):
# According to today's Huntsville Times
# http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/news/1125047783228320.xml&coll=1
# a few towns on Alabama's "eastern border with Georgia, such as Phenix City
# in Russell County, Lanett in Chambers County and some towns in Lee County,
# set their watches and clocks on Eastern time."  It quotes H.H. "Bubba"

# in Columbus."
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-02-22):
# Four cities are involved.  The two not mentioned above are Smiths Station
# and Valley.  Barbara Brooks, Valley's assistant treasurer, heard it started
# because West Point Pepperell textile mills were in Alabama while the

# In 1869 the Chicago Astronomical Society contracted with the city to keep
# time.  Though delayed by the Great Fire, by 1880 a wire ran from the
# Dearborn Observatory (on the University of Chicago campus) to City Hall,
# which then sent signals to police and fire stations.  However, railroads got
# their time signals from the Allegheny Observatory, the Madison Observatory,
# the Ann Arbor Observatory, etc., so their clocks did not agree with each

# From an email administrator of the City of Fort Pierre, SD (2015-12-21):
# Fort Pierre is technically located in the Mountain time zone as is

# uses the Central time zone due to doing most of their business in
# Pierre so it simplifies schedules.  I have lived in Stanley County
# all my life and it has been that way since I can remember.  (43 years!)
#
# From Paul Eggert (2015-12-25):
# Assume this practice predates 1970, so Fort Pierre can use America/Chicago.

# From Paul Eggert (2015-04-06):
# In 1950s Nashville a public clock had dueling faces, one for conservatives
# and the other for liberals; the two sides didn't agree about the time of day.
# I haven't found a photo of this clock, nor have I tracked down the TIME
# magazine report cited below, but here's the story as told by the late
# American journalist John Seigenthaler, who was there:
#
# "The two [newspaper] owners held strongly contrasting political and
# ideological views.  Evans was a New South liberal, Stahlman an Old South
# conservative, and their two papers frequently clashed editorially, often on
# the same day....  In the 1950s as the state legislature was grappling with
# the question of whether to approve daylight saving time for the entire state,
# TIME magazine reported:
#
# "'The Nashville Banner and The Nashville Tennessean rarely agree on anything
# but the time of day - and last week they couldn't agree on that.'
#
# "It was all too true. The clock on the front of the building had two faces -
# The Tennessean side of the building facing west, the other, east.  When it
# was high noon Banner time, it was 11 a.m. Tennessean time."
#
# Seigenthaler J. For 100 years, Tennessean had it covered.

# US mountain time, represented by Denver

# Colorado, far western Kansas, Montana, western
# Nebraska, Nevada border (Jackpot, Owyhee, and Mountain City),
# New Mexico, southwestern North Dakota,
# western South Dakota, far western Texas (El Paso County, Hudspeth County,

#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-10-25):
# On 1921-03-04 federal law placed all of Texas into the central time zone.
# However, El Paso ignored the law for decades and continued to observe
# mountain time, on the grounds that that's what they had always done
# and they weren't about to let the federal government tell them what to do.
# Eventually the federal government gave in and changed the law on
# 1970-04-10 to match what El Paso was actually doing.  Although
# that's slightly after our 1970 cutoff, there is no need to create a
# separate zone for El Paso since they were ignoring the law anyway.  See:
# Long T. El Pasoans were time rebels, fought to stay in Mountain zone.

# north of the Salmon River, and the towns of Burgdorf and Warren),

# From Paul Eggert (2016-08-20):
# In early February 1948, in response to California's electricity shortage,
# PG&E changed power frequency from 60 to 59.5 Hz during daylight hours,
# causing electric clocks to lose six minutes per day.  (This did not change
# legal time, and is not part of the data here.)  See:
# Ross SA. An energy crisis from the past: Northern California in 1948.
# Working Paper No. 8, Institute of Governmental Studies, UC Berkeley,
# 1973-11.  https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8x22k30c
#
# In another measure to save electricity, DST was instituted from 1948-03-14
# at 02:01 to 1949-01-16 at 02:00, with the governor having the option to move
# the fallback transition earlier.  See pages 3-4 of:
# http://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1948/48Vol1_Chapters.pdf
#
# In response:
#
#   Governor Warren received a torrent of objecting mail, and it is not too much
#   to speculate that the objections to Daylight Saving Time were one important
#   factor in the defeat of the Dewey-Warren Presidential ticket in California.
#     -- Ross, p 25
#
# On December 8 the governor exercised the option, setting the date to January 1
# (LA Times 1948-12-09).  The transition time was 02:00 (LA Times 1949-01-01).
#
# Despite the controversy, in 1949 California voters approved Proposition 12,
# which established DST from April's last Sunday at 01:00 until September's
# last Sunday at 02:00. This was amended by 1962's Proposition 6, which changed
# the fall-back date to October's last Sunday. See:

# Alaska
# AK%sT is the modern abbreviation for -09 per USNO.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-06-15):
# Howse writes that Alaska switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar,
# and from east-of-GMT to west-of-GMT days, when the US bought it from Russia.
# On Friday, 1867-10-18 (Gregorian), at precisely 15:30 local time, the
# Russian forts and fleet at Sitka fired salutes to mark the ceremony of
# formal transfer.  See the Sacramento Daily Union (1867-11-14), p 3, col 2.
# https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SDU18671114.2.12.1
# Sitka workers did not change their calendars until Sunday, 1867-10-20,
# and so celebrated two Sundays that week.  See: Ahllund T (tr Hallamaa P).
# From the memoirs of a Finnish workman. Alaska History. 2006 Fall;21(2):1-25.
# http://alaskahistoricalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ahllund-2006-Memoirs-of-a-Finnish-Workman.pdf
# Include only the time zone part of this transition, ignoring the switch
# from Julian to Gregorian, since we can't represent the Julian calendar.
#
# As far as we know, of the locations mentioned below only Sitka was
# permanently inhabited in 1867 by anyone using either calendar.
# (Yakutat was colonized by the Russians in 1799, but the settlement was
# destroyed in 1805 by a Yakutat-kon war party.)  Many of Alaska's inhabitants
# were unaware of the US acquisition of Alaska, much less of any calendar or
# time change.  However, the Russian-influenced part of Alaska did observe
# Russian time, and it is more accurate to model this than to ignore it.
# The database format requires an exact transition time; use the Russian
# salute as a somewhat-arbitrary time for the formal transfer of control for
# all of Alaska.  Sitka's UTC offset is -9:01:13; adjust its 15:30 to the
# local times of other Alaskan locations so that they change simultaneously.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-18):
# One opinion of the early 1980s turmoil in Alaska over time zones and
# daylight saving time appeared as graffiti on a Juneau airport wall:
# "Welcome to Juneau.  Please turn your watch back to the 19th century."
# See: Turner W. Alaska's four time zones now two. NY Times 1983-11-01.
# http://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/01/us/alaska-s-four-time-zones-now-two.html

# http://alaskahistoricalsociety.org/discover-alaska/glimpses-of-the-past/keeping-time-in-alaska/

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-02-01):
# Here's database-relevant material from the 2001 "Alaska History" article:
#
# On September 20 [1979]...DOT...officials decreed that on April 27,
# 1980, Juneau and other nearby communities would move to Yukon Time.
# Sitka, Petersburg, Wrangell, and Ketchikan, however, would remain on
# Pacific Time.
#
# ...on September 22, 1980, DOT Secretary Neil E. Goldschmidt rescinded the
# Department's September 1979 decision. Juneau and other communities in
# northern Southeast reverted to Pacific Time on October 26.
#
# On October 28 [1983]...the Metlakatla Indian Community Council voted
# unanimously to keep the reservation on Pacific Time.
#
# According to DOT official Joanne Petrie, Indian reservations are not
# bound to follow time zones imposed by neighboring jurisdictions.
#
# (The last is consistent with how the database now handles the Navajo
# Nation.)

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-02-09):
# I just spoke by phone with a staff member at the Metlakatla Indian
# Community office (using contact information available at
# http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CIS.cfm?Comm_Boro_name=Metlakatla
# It's shortly after 1:00 here on the east coast of the United States;
# the staffer said it was shortly after 10:00 there. When I asked whether
# that meant they were on Pacific time, they said no - they were on their
# own time. I asked about daylight saving; they said it wasn't used. I
# did not inquire about practices in the past.

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-08-17):
# For lack of better information, assume that Metlakatla's
# abandonment of use of daylight saving resulted from the 1983 vote.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2015-11-09):
# It seems Metlakatla did go off PST on Sunday, November 1, changing
# their time to AKST and are going to follow Alaska's DST, switching
# between AKST and AKDT from now on....
# https://www.krbd.org/2015/10/30/annette-island-times-they-are-a-changing/

# From Ryan Stanley (2018-11-06):
# The Metlakatla community in Alaska has decided not to change its
# clock back an hour starting on November 4th, 2018 (day before yesterday).
# They will be gmtoff=-28800 year-round.

# From Paul Eggert (2018-12-16):
# In a 2018-12-11 special election, Metlakatla voted to go back to
# Alaska time (including daylight saving time) starting next year.
# https://www.krbd.org/2018/12/12/metlakatla-to-follow-alaska-standard-time-allow-liquor-sales/
#
# From Ryan Stanley (2019-01-11):
# The community will be changing back on the 20th of this month...
# From Tim Parenti (2019-01-11):
# Per an announcement on the Metlakatla community's official Facebook page, the
# "fall back" will be on Sunday 2019-01-20 at 02:00:
# https://www.facebook.com/141055983004923/photos/607150969728753/
# So they won't be waiting for Alaska to join them on 2019-03-10, but will
# rather change their clocks twice in seven weeks.

# From Arthur David Olson (2010-12-09):
# "Hawaiian Time" by Robert C. Schmitt and Doak C. Cox appears on pages 207-225

# the article is available at
# https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/239/2/JL26215.pdf
# and indicates that standard time was adopted effective noon, January
# 13, 1896 (page 218), that in "1933, the Legislature decreed daylight
# saving for the period between the last Sunday of each April and the
# last Sunday of each September, but less than a month later repealed the

# 90...At 2 o'clock ante meridian of the last Sunday in April of each

# Now we turn to US areas that have diverged from the consensus since 1970.

# Arizona mostly uses MST.

# From Paul Eggert (2002-10-20):
#
# The information in the rest of this paragraph is derived from the
# Daylight Saving Time web page
# <http://www.dlapr.lib.az.us/links/daylight.htm> (2002-01-23)
# maintained by the Arizona State Library, Archives and Public Records.
# Between 1944-01-01 and 1944-04-01 the State of Arizona used standard
# time, but by federal law railroads, airlines, bus lines, military
# personnel, and some engaged in interstate commerce continued to
# observe war (i.e., daylight saving) time.  The 1944-03-17 Phoenix
# Gazette says that was the date the law changed, and that 04-01 was
# the date the state's clocks would change.  In 1945 the State of
# Arizona used standard time all year, again with exceptions only as
# mandated by federal law.  Arizona observed DST in 1967, but Arizona
# Laws 1968, ch. 183 (effective 1968-03-21) repealed DST.
#
# Shanks says the 1944 experiment came to an end on 1944-03-17.

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Indiana
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-11-30):
# A brief but entertaining history of time in Indiana describes a 1949 debate
# in the Indiana House where city legislators (who favored "fast time")
# tussled with farm legislators (who didn't) over a bill to outlaw DST:
#  "Lacking enough votes, the city faction tries to filibuster until time runs
#   out on the session at midnight, but rural champion Rep. Herbert Copeland,
#   R-Madison, leans over the gallery railing and forces the official clock
#   back to 9 p.m., breaking it in the process.  The clock sticks on 9 as the
#   debate rages on into the night.  The filibuster finally dies out and the
#   bill passes, while outside the chamber, clocks read 3:30 a.m.  In the end,
#   it doesn't matter which side won.  The law has no enforcement powers and
#   is simply ignored by fast-time communities."
# How Indiana went from 'God's time' to split zones and daylight-saving.

#
# From Paul Eggert (2007-08-17):
# Since 1970, most of Indiana has been like America/Indiana/Indianapolis,
# with the following exceptions:
#
# - Gibson, Jasper, Lake, LaPorte, Newton, Porter, Posey, Spencer,
#   Vanderburgh, and Warrick counties have been like America/Chicago.
#
# - Dearborn and Ohio counties have been like America/New_York.
#
# - Clark, Floyd, and Harrison counties have been like
#   America/Kentucky/Louisville.
#
# - Crawford, Daviess, Dubois, Knox, Martin, Perry, Pike, Pulaski, Starke,
#   and Switzerland counties have their own time zone histories as noted below.
#
# Shanks partitioned Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
# and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
# Those Hoosiers!  Such a flighty and changeable people!
# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
#
# Other than Indianapolis, the Indiana place names are so nondescript
# that they would be ambiguous if we left them at the 'America' level.
# So we reluctantly put them all in a subdirectory 'America/Indiana'.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-26):
# https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2006/01/20/06-563/standard-time-zone-boundary-in-the-state-of-indiana
# says "DOT is relocating the time zone boundary in Indiana to move Starke,
# Pulaski, Knox, Daviess, Martin, Pike, Dubois, and Perry Counties from the
# Eastern Time Zone to the Central Time Zone.... The effective date of
# this rule is 2 a.m. EST Sunday, April 2, 2006, which is the
# changeover date from standard time to Daylight Saving Time."
# Strictly speaking, this meant the affected counties changed their
# clocks twice that night, but this obviously was in error.  The intent
# was that 01:59:59 EST be followed by 02:00:00 CDT.

# From Gwillim Law (2007-02-10):
# The Associated Press has been reporting that Pulaski County, Indiana is
# going to switch from Central to Eastern Time on March 11, 2007....

# From Paul Eggert (2018-03-20):
# The Louisville & Nashville Railroad's 1883-11-18 change occurred at
# 10:00 old local time; train were supposed to come to a standstill
# for precisely 18 minutes.  See Bartky Fig. 1 (page 50).  It is not
# clear how this matched civil time in Louisville, so for now continue
# to assume Louisville switched at noon new local time, like New York.
#
# From Michael Deckers (2019-08-06):
# From the contemporary source given by Alois Treindl,
# the switch in Louisville on 1946-04-28 was on 00:01
# From Paul Eggert (2019-08-26):
# That source was the Louisville Courier-Journal, 1946-04-27, p 4.
# Shanks gives 02:00 for all 20th-century transition times in Louisville.
# Evidently this is wrong for spring 1946.  Although also likely wrong
# for other dates, we have no data.
#
# Part of Kentucky left its clocks alone in 1974.

# Wayne County, Kentucky
#
# From Lake Cumberland LIFE
# http://www.lake-cumberland.com/life/archive/news990129time.shtml
# (1999-01-29) via WKYM-101.7:
# Clinton County has joined Wayne County in asking the DoT to change from
# the Central to the Eastern time zone....  The Wayne County government made
# the same request in December.  And while Russell County officials have not
# taken action, the majority of respondents to a poll conducted there in
# August indicated they would like to change to "fast time" also.
# The three Lake Cumberland counties are the farthest east of any U.S.
# location in the Central time zone.
#
# From Rich Wales (2000-08-29):
# After prolonged debate, and despite continuing deep differences of opinion,
# Wayne County (central Kentucky) is switching from Central (-0600) to Eastern
# (-0500) time.  They won't "fall back" this year.  See Sara Shipley,
# The difference an hour makes, Nando Times (2000-08-29 15:33 -0400).
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-07-16):
# The final rule was published in the
# Federal Register 65, 160 (2000-08-17), pp 50154-50158.

# From Rives McDow (2000-08-30):
# Here ... are all the changes in the US since 1985.

#	previously split between MST and CST) ... 1990-10
# Starke County, IN (from CST to EST) ... 1991-10

# West Wendover, NV (from PST TO MST) ... 1999-10
# Wayne County, KY (from CST to EST) ... 2000-10
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-07-17):
# We don't know where the line used to be within Kearny County, KS,
# so omit that change for now.
# See America/Indiana/Knox for the Starke County, IN change.
# See America/North_Dakota/Center for the Oliver County, ND change.
# West Wendover, NV officially switched from Pacific to mountain time on
# 1999-10-31.  See the
# Federal Register 64, 203 (1999-10-21), pp 56705-56707.
# https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1999-10-21/html/99-27240.htm
# However, the Federal Register says that West Wendover already operated
# on mountain time, and the rule merely made this official;
# hence a separate tz entry is not needed.

# Michigan
#
# From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
# Michigan didn't observe DST from 1968 to 1973.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
# Shanks writes that Michigan started using standard time on 1885-09-18,
# but Howse writes (pp 124-125, referring to Popular Astronomy, 1901-01)
# that Detroit kept
#
#	local time until 1900 when the City Council decreed that clocks should
#	be put back twenty-eight minutes to Central Standard Time.  Half the
#	city obeyed, half refused.  After considerable debate, the decision
#	was rescinded and the city reverted to Sun time.  A derisive offer to
#	erect a sundial in front of the city hall was referred to the
#	Committee on Sewers.  Then, in 1905, Central time was adopted
#	by city vote.
#
# This story is too entertaining to be false, so go with Howse over Shanks.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Garland (1927) writes "Cleveland and Detroit advanced their clocks
# one hour in 1914."  This change is not in Shanks.  We have no more
# info, so omit this for now.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2019-07-06):
# Due to a complicated set of legal maneuvers, in 1967 Michigan did
# not start daylight saving time when the rest of the US did.
# Instead, it began DST on Jun 14 at 00:01.  This was big news:
# the Detroit Free Press reported it at the top of Page 1 on
# 1967-06-14, in an article "State Adjusting to Switch to Fast Time"
# by Gary Blonston, above an article about Thurgood Marshall's
# confirmation to the US Supreme Court.  Although Shanks says Detroit
# observed DST until 1967-10-29 00:01, that time of day seems to be
# incorrect, as the Free Press later said DST ended in Michigan at the
# same time as the rest of the US.  Also, although Shanks reports no DST in
# Detroit in 1968, it did observe DST that year; in the November 1968
# election Michigan voters narrowly repealed DST, effective 1969.
#
# Most of Michigan observed DST from 1973 on, but was a bit late in 1975.

# From Chris Walton (2011-12-01)
# In the first of Tammy Hardwick's articles
# http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&t=spec&ar=260
# she quotes the Friday November 1/1918 edition of the Creston Review.
# The quote includes these two statements:
# 'Sunday the CPR went back to the old system of time...'
# '... The daylight saving scheme was dropped all over Canada at the same time,'
# These statements refer to a transition from daylight time to standard time
# that occurred nationally on Sunday October 27/1918.  This transition was
# also documented in the Saturday October 26/1918 edition of the Toronto Star.

# In light of that evidence, we alter the date from the earlier believed
# Oct 31, to Oct 27, 1918 (and Sunday is a more likely transition day
# than Thursday) in all Canadian rulesets.

# west Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward I,
# Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Listuguj reserve

# From Brian Inglis (2015-07-20):
# From the historical weather station records available at:
# https://weatherspark.com/history/28351/1971/Sydney-Nova-Scotia-Canada
# Sydney shares the same time history as Glace Bay, so was
# likely to be the same across the island....
# Sydney, as the capital and most populous location, or Cape Breton, would
# have been better names for the zone had we known this in 1996.

# From Paul Eggert (2015-07-20):
# Shanks & Pottenger write that since 1970 most of this region has been like
# Halifax.  Many locales did not observe peacetime DST until 1972;
# the Cape Breton area, represented by Glace Bay, is the largest we know of
# (Glace Bay was perhaps not the best name choice but no point changing now).
# Shanks & Pottenger also write that Liverpool, NS was the only town
# in Canada to observe DST in 1971 but not 1970; for now we'll assume
# this is a typo.

# From Jeffery Nichols (2020-01-09):
# America/Halifax ... also applies to Îles-de-la-Madeleine and the Listuguj
# reserve in Quebec. Officially, this came into effect on January 1, 2007
# (Legal Time Act, CQLR c T-5.1), but the legislative debates surrounding that
# bill say that it is "accommodating the customs and practices" of those
# regions, which suggests that they have always been in-line with Halifax.

# Ontario

# From Mark Brader (2003-07-26):
# [According to the Toronto Star] Orillia, Ontario, adopted DST
# effective Saturday, 1912-06-22, 22:00; the article mentions that
# Port Arthur (now part of Thunder Bay, Ontario) as well as Moose Jaw
# have already done so.  In Orillia DST was to run until Saturday,
# 1912-08-31 (no time mentioned), but it was met with considerable
# hostility from certain segments of the public, and was revoked after
# only two weeks - I copied it as Saturday, 1912-07-07, 22:00, but
# presumably that should be -07-06.  (1912-06-19, -07-12; also letters
# earlier in June).
#
# Kenora, Ontario, was to abandon DST on 1914-06-01 (-05-21).

# "The first Sunday after the switch was made, [DST proponent and

# This became a symbol of the downfall of daylight saving in Orillia."
# The mayor became known as "Daylight Bill".

# From Mark Brader (2010-03-06):
#
# In the (Toronto) Globe and Mail for Saturday, 1955-09-24, in the bottom
# right corner of page 1, it says that Toronto will return to standard
# time at 2 am Sunday morning (which agrees with the database), and that:
#
#     The one-hour setback will go into effect throughout most of Ontario,
#     except in areas like Windsor which remains on standard time all year.
#
# ... I don't know if Windsor began observing DST when Detroit did,
# or in 1974, or on some other date.
#
# By the way, the article continues by noting that:
#
#     Some cities in the United States have pushed the deadline back
#     three weeks and will change over from daylight saving in October.

#   A list of the places in Canada using daylight saving time would
# require yearly revision. From information kindly furnished by
# the provincial governments and by the postmasters in many cities
# and towns, it is found that the following places used daylight sav-
# ing in 1930. The information for the province of Quebec is definite,
# for the other provinces only approximate:
#
#	Province	Daylight saving time used
# Prince Edward Island	Not used.
# Nova Scotia		In Halifax only.
# New Brunswick		In St. John only.
# Quebec		In the following places:
#			Montreal	Lachine
#			Quebec		Mont-Royal
#			Lévis		Iberville
#			St. Lambert	Cap de la Madelèine
#			Verdun		Loretteville
#			Westmount	Richmond
#			Outremont	St. Jérôme
#			Longueuil	Greenfield Park
#			Arvida		Waterloo
#			Chambly-Canton	Beaulieu
#			Melbourne	La Tuque
#			St. Théophile	Buckingham
# Ontario		Used generally in the cities and towns along
#			the southerly part of the province. Not
#			used in the northwesterly part.
# Manitoba		Not used.
# Saskatchewan		In Regina only.
# Alberta		Not used.
# British Columbia	Not used.
#
#   With some exceptions, the use of daylight saving may be said to be limited
# to those cities and towns lying between Quebec city and Windsor, Ont.

# Manitoba

# From Rob Douglas (2006-04-06):
# the old Manitoba Time Act - as amended by Bill 2, assented to
# March 27, 1987 ... said ...
# "between two o'clock Central Standard Time in the morning of
# the first Sunday of April of each year and two o'clock Central
# Standard Time in the morning of the last Sunday of October next
# following, one hour in advance of Central Standard Time."...
# I believe that the English legislation [of the old time act] had
# been assented to (March 22, 1967)....
# Also, as far as I can tell, there was no order-in-council varying
# the time of Daylight Saving Time for 2005 and so the provisions of
# the 1987 version would apply - the changeover was at 2:00 Central
# Standard Time (i.e. not until 3:00 Central Daylight Time).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-10):
# Shanks & Pottenger say Manitoba switched at 02:00 (not 02:00s)
# starting 1966.  Since 02:00s is clearly correct for 1967 on, assume
# it was also 02:00s in 1966.

# Saskatchewan

# From Mark Brader (2003-07-26):
# The first actual adoption of DST in Canada was at the municipal
# level.  As the [Toronto] Star put it (1912-06-07), "While people
# elsewhere have long been talking of legislation to save daylight,
# the city of Moose Jaw [Saskatchewan] has acted on its own hook."
# DST in Moose Jaw began on Saturday, 1912-06-01 (no time mentioned:
# presumably late evening, as below), and would run until "the end of
# the summer".  The discrepancy between municipal time and railroad
# time was noted.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-07-27):
# Willett (1914-03) notes that DST "has been in operation ... in the
# City of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, for one year."

# From Paul Eggert (2019-07-25):
# Pearce's book says Regina observed DST in 1914-1917.  No dates and times,
# unfortunately.  It also says that in 1914 Saskatoon observed DST
# from 1 June to 6 July, and that DST was also tried out in Davidson,
# Melfort, and Prince Albert.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that since 1970 this region has mostly been as Regina.
# Some western towns (e.g. Swift Current) switched from MST/MDT to CST in 1972.
# Other western towns (e.g. Lloydminster) are like Edmonton.
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Denare Beach and Creighton
# are like Winnipeg, in violation of Saskatchewan law.

# From W. Jones (1992-11-06):
# The. . .below is based on information I got from our law library, the
# provincial archives, and the provincial Community Services department.
# A precise history would require digging through newspaper archives, and
# since you didn't say what you wanted, I didn't bother.
#
# Saskatchewan is split by a time zone meridian (105W) and over the years
# the boundary became pretty ragged as communities near it reevaluated
# their affiliations in one direction or the other.  In 1965 a provincial
# referendum favoured legislating common time practices.
#
# On 15 April 1966 the Time Act (c. T-14, Revised Statutes of
# Saskatchewan 1978) was proclaimed, and established that the eastern
# part of Saskatchewan would use CST year round, that districts in
# northwest Saskatchewan would by default follow CST but could opt to
# follow Mountain Time rules (thus 1 hour difference in the winter and
# zero in the summer), and that districts in southwest Saskatchewan would
# by default follow MT but could opt to follow CST.
#
# It took a few years for the dust to settle (I know one story of a town
# on one time zone having its school in another, such that a mom had to
# serve her family lunch in two shifts), but presently it seems that only
# a few towns on the border with Alberta (e.g. Lloydminster) follow MT
# rules any more; all other districts appear to have used CST year round
# since sometime in the 1960s.

# From Chris Walton (2006-06-26):
# The Saskatchewan time act which was last updated in 1996 is about 30 pages
# long and rather painful to read.

# Alberta

# From Alois Treindl (2019-07-19):
# There was no DST in Alberta in 1967... Calgary Herald, 29 April 1967.
# 1969, no DST, from Edmonton Journal 18 April 1969
#
# From Paul Eggert (2019-07-25):
# Pearce's book says that Alberta's 1948 Daylight Saving Act required
# Mountain Standard Time without DST, and that "anyone who broke that law
# could be fined up to $25 and costs".  There seems to be no record of
# anybody paying the fine.  The law was not changed until an August 1971
# plebiscite reinstituted DST in 1972.  This story is also mentioned in:

# British Columbia

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger write that since 1970 most of this region has
# been like Vancouver.
# Dawson Creek uses MST.  Much of east BC is like Edmonton.

# From Matt Johnson (2015-09-21):
# Fort Nelson, BC, Canada will cancel DST this year.  So while previously they
# were aligned with America/Vancouver, they're now aligned with
# America/Dawson_Creek.
# http://www.northernrockies.ca/EN/meta/news/archives/2015/northern-rockies-time-change.html
#
# From Tim Parenti (2015-09-23):
# This requires a new zone for the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality,
# America/Fort_Nelson.  The resolution of 2014-12-08 was reached following a
# 2014-11-15 poll with nearly 75% support.  Effectively, the municipality has
# been on MST (-0700) like Dawson Creek since it advanced its clocks on
# 2015-03-08.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2019-07-25):
# Shanks says Fort Nelson did not observe DST in 1946, unlike Vancouver.
# Alois Treindl confirmed this on 07-22, citing the 1946-04-27 Vancouver Daily
# Province.  He also cited the 1946-09-28 Victoria Daily Times, which said
# that Vancouver, Victoria, etc. "change at midnight Saturday"; for now,
# guess they meant 02:00 Sunday since 02:00 was common practice in Vancouver.
#
# Early Vancouver, Volume Four, by Major J.S. Matthews, V.D., 2011 edition
# says that a 1922 plebiscite adopted DST, but a 1923 plebiscite rejected it.
# http://former.vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/archives/digitized/EarlyVan/SearchEarlyVan/Vol4pdf/MatthewsEarlyVancouverVol4_DaylightSavings.pdf
# A catalog entry for a newspaper clipping seems to indicate that Vancouver

# From Chris Walton (2022-11-06):
# The 5th edition of the Atlas of Canada contains a time zone map that
# shows both legislated and observed time zone boundaries.
# All communities on Baffin Island are shown to be observing Eastern time.
# The date on the map is 1984.
# https://ftp.maps.canada.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/raster/atlas_5_ed/eng/other/referencemaps/mcr4056.pdf

# From Rives McDow (1999-09-04):
# Nunavut ... moved ... to incorporate the whole territory into one time zone.
# Nunavut moves to single time zone Oct. 31
# http://www.nunatsiaq.com/nunavut/nvt90903_13.html

# From Paul Eggert (1999-09-20):
# Basic Facts: The New Territory
# http://www.nunavut.com/basicfacts/english/basicfacts_1territory.html
# (1999) reports that ... Coral Harbour does not observe DST.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) say the following, but we lack histories
# for these potential new Zones.
#
# The Canadian Forces station at Alert uses Eastern Time while the
# handful of residents at the Eureka weather station [in the Central
# zone] skip daylight savings.  Baffin Island, which is crossed by the
# Central, Eastern and Atlantic Time zones only uses Eastern Time.
# Gjoa Haven, Taloyoak and Pelly Bay all use Mountain instead of
# Central Time and Southampton Island [in the Central zone] is not
# required to use daylight savings.

# From <http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/nunavut001130/nvt21110_02.html>
# Nunavut now has two time zones (2000-11-10):
# The Nunavut government would allow its employees in Kugluktuk and
# Cambridge Bay to operate on central time year-round, putting them
# one hour behind the rest of Nunavut for six months during the winter.
# At the end of October the two communities had rebelled against
# Nunavut's unified time zone, refusing to shift to eastern time with
# the rest of the territory for the winter.  Cambridge Bay remained on
# central time, while Kugluktuk, even farther west, reverted to
# mountain time, which they had used before the advent of Nunavut's
# unified time zone in 1999.
#
# From Rives McDow (2001-01-20), quoting the Nunavut government:
# The preceding decision came into effect at midnight, Saturday Nov 4, 2000.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-12-04):
# Let's just keep track of the official times for now.

# From Rives McDow (2001-03-07):
# The premier of Nunavut has issued a ministerial statement advising
# that effective 2001-04-01, the territory of Nunavut will revert
# back to three time zones (mountain, central, and eastern).  Of the
# cities in Nunavut, Coral Harbor is the only one that I know of that
# has said it will not observe dst, staying on EST year round.  I'm
# checking for more info, and will get back to you if I come up with
# more.
# [Also see <http://www.nunatsiaq.com/nunavut/nvt10309_06.html> (2001-03-09).]

# From Gwillim Law (2005-05-21):
# According to ...
# http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/geomap.asp
# (from a 1998 Canadian Geographic article), the de facto and de jure time
# for Southampton Island (at the north end of Hudson Bay) is UTC-5 all year
# round.  Using Google, it's easy to find other websites that confirm this.
# I wasn't able to find how far back this time regimen goes, but since it
# predates the creation of Nunavut, it probably goes back many years....
# The Inuktitut name of Coral Harbour is Sallit, but it's rarely used.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2014-10-17):
# For lack of better information, assume that Southampton Island observed
# daylight saving only during wartime.  Gwillim Law's email also
# mentioned maps now maintained by National Research Council Canada;
# see above for an up-to-date link.

# From Chris Walton (2007-03-01):
# ... the community of Resolute (located on Cornwallis Island in
# Nunavut) moved from Central Time to Eastern Time last November.
# Basically the community did not change its clocks at the end of
# daylight saving....
# http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2006-11/nov13_06none.html

# From Chris Walton (2011-03-21):
# Back in 2007 I initiated the creation of a new "zone file" for Resolute
# Bay. Resolute Bay is a small community located about 900km north of
# the Arctic Circle. The zone file was required because Resolute Bay had
# decided to use UTC-5 instead of UTC-6 for the winter of 2006-2007.
#
# According to new information which I received last week, Resolute Bay
# went back to using UTC-6 in the winter of 2007-2008...
#
# On March 11/2007 most of Canada went onto daylight saving. On March
# 14/2007 I phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office to do a "time check." I
# talked to somebody that was both knowledgeable and helpful. I was able
# to confirm that Resolute Bay was still operating on UTC-5. It was
# explained to me that Resolute Bay had been on the Eastern Time zone
# (EST) in the winter, and was now back on the Central Time zone (CDT).
# i.e. the time zone had changed twice in the last year but the clocks
# had not moved. The residents had to know which time zone they were in
# so they could follow the correct TV schedule...
#
# On Nov 02/2008 most of Canada went onto standard time. On Nov 03/2008 I
# phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office...[D]ue to the challenging nature
# of the phone call, I decided to seek out an alternate source of
# information. I found an e-mail address for somebody by the name of
# Stephanie Adams whose job was listed as "Inns North Support Officer for
# Arctic Co-operatives." I was under the impression that Stephanie lived
# and worked in Resolute Bay...
#
# On March 14/2011 I phoned the hamlet office again. I was told that
# Resolute Bay had been using Central Standard Time over the winter of
# 2010-2011 and that the clocks had therefore been moved one hour ahead
# on March 13/2011. The person I talked to was aware that Resolute Bay
# had previously experimented with Eastern Standard Time but he could not
# tell me when the practice had stopped.
#
# On March 17/2011 I searched the Web to find an e-mail address of
# somebody that might be able to tell me exactly when Resolute Bay went
# off Eastern Standard Time. I stumbled on the name "Aziz Kheraj." Aziz
# used to be the mayor of Resolute Bay and he apparently owns half the
# businesses including "South Camp Inn." This website has some info on
# Aziz:
# http://www.uphere.ca/node/493
#
# I sent Aziz an e-mail asking when Resolute Bay had stopped using
# Eastern Standard Time.
#
# Aziz responded quickly with this: "hi, The time was not changed for the
# 1 year only, the following year, the community went back to the old way
# of "spring ahead-fall behind" currently we are zulu plus 5 hrs and in
# the winter Zulu plus 6 hrs"
#
# This of course conflicted with everything I had ascertained in November 2008.
#
# I sent Aziz a copy of my 2008 e-mail exchange with Stephanie. Aziz
# responded with this: "Hi, Stephanie lives in Winnipeg. I live here, You
# may want to check with the weather office in Resolute Bay or do a
# search on the weather through Env. Canada. web site"
#
# If I had realized the Stephanie did not live in Resolute Bay I would
# never have contacted her.  I now believe that all the information I
# obtained in November 2008 should be ignored...
# I apologize for reporting incorrect information in 2008.

# From Tim Parenti (2020-03-05):
# The government of Yukon announced [yesterday] the cessation of seasonal time
# changes.  "After clocks are pushed ahead one hour on March 8, the territory
# will remain on [UTC-07].  ... [The government] found 93 per cent of
# respondents wanted to end seasonal time changes and, of that group, 70 per
# cent wanted 'permanent Pacific Daylight Saving Time.'"
# https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-end-daylight-saving-time-1.5486358
#
# Although the government press release prefers PDT, we prefer MST for
# consistency with nearby Dawson Creek, Creston, and Fort Nelson.
# https://yukon.ca/en/news/yukon-end-seasonal-time-change

# From Andrew G. Smith (2020-09-24):
# Yukon has completed its regulatory change to be on UTC -7 year-round....
# http://www.gov.yk.ca/legislation/regs/oic2020_125.pdf
# What we have done is re-defined Yukon Standard Time, as we are
# authorized to do under section 33 of our Interpretation Act:
# http://www.gov.yk.ca/legislation/acts/interpretation_c.pdf
#
# From Paul Eggert (2020-09-24):
# tzdb uses the obsolete YST abbreviation for standard time in Yukon through
# about 1970, and uses PST for standard time in Yukon since then.  Consistent
# with that, use MST for -07, the new standard time in Yukon effective Nov. 1.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-12-07):
# The Investigation and Analysis Service of the
# Mexican Library of Congress (MLoC) has published a
# history of Mexican local time (in Spanish)
# http://www.diputados.gob.mx/bibliot/publica/inveyana/polisoc/horver/index.htm
#
# Here are the discrepancies between Shanks & Pottenger (S&P) and the MLoC.
# (In all cases we go with the MLoC.)
# S&P report that Baja was at -8:00 in 1922/1923.
# S&P say the 1930 transition in Baja was 1930-11-16.
# S&P report no DST during summer 1931.
# S&P report a transition at 1932-03-30 23:00, not 1932-04-01.

# From Gwillim Law (2001-02-20):
# There are some other discrepancies between the Decrees page and the
# tz database.  I think they can best be explained by supposing that
# the researchers who prepared the Decrees page failed to find some of
# the relevant documents.

# From Heitor David Pinto (2024-08-04):
# In 1931, the decree implementing DST specified that it would take
# effect on 30 April....

# In 1942, the decree changing Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora,
# Sinaloa and Nayarit to UTC-7 was published on 24 April, but it said that it

# occurred. The database currently shows 24 April 1942.

#
# In 1948, the decree changing Baja California to UTC-7 specified that it

#
# All changes in Baja California from 1948 to 1952 match those in California,
# on the same dates or with a difference of one day.
# So it may be easier to implement these changes as DST with rule CA
# during this whole period.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2024-08-18):
# For now, maintain the slightly-different history for Baja California,
# as we have no information on whether 1948/1952 clocks in Tijuana followed
# the decrees or followed San Diego.

# From Alan Perry (1996-02-15):
# A guy from our Mexico subsidiary finally found the Presidential Decree
# outlining the timezone changes in Mexico.
#
# ------------- Begin Forwarded Message -------------
#
# I finally got my hands on the Official Presidential Decree that sets up the
# rules for the DST changes. The rules are:
#
# 1. The country is divided in 3 timezones:
#    - Baja California Norte (the Mexico/BajaNorte TZ)
#    - Baja California Sur, Nayarit, Sinaloa and Sonora (the Mexico/BajaSur TZ)
#    - The rest of the country (the Mexico/General TZ)
#
# 2. From the first Sunday in April at 2:00 AM to the last Sunday in October
#    at 2:00 AM, the times in each zone are as follows:
#    BajaNorte: GMT+7
#    BajaSur:   GMT+6
#    General:   GMT+5
#
# 3. The rest of the year, the times are as follows:
#    BajaNorte: GMT+8
#    BajaSur:   GMT+7
#    General:   GMT+6
#
# The Decree was published in Mexico's Official Newspaper on January 4th.
#
# -------------- End Forwarded Message --------------
# From Paul Eggert (1996-06-12):
# For an English translation of the decree, see
# "Diario Oficial: Time Zone Changeover" (1996-01-04).
# http://mexico-travel.com/extra/timezone_eng.html

# From Rives McDow (1998-10-08):
# The State of Quintana Roo has reverted back to central STD and DST times
# (i.e. UTC -0600 and -0500 as of 1998-08-02).

# From Rives McDow (2000-01-10):
# Effective April 4, 1999 at 2:00 AM local time, Sonora changed to the time

# ... Mexico City Mayor López Obrador "...is threatening to keep

# (2001-02-01) shows Baja and Chihauhua as still using US DST rules,

# James F. Smith writes in today's LA Times
# * Sonora will continue to observe standard time.
# * Last week Mexico City's mayor Andrés Manuel López Obrador decreed that
#   the Federal District will not adopt DST.
# * 4 of 16 district leaders announced they'll ignore the decree.
# * The decree does not affect federal-controlled facilities including
#   the airport, banks, hospitals, and schools.
#
# For now we'll assume that the Federal District will bow to federal rules.

# From Jesper Nørgaard (2001-04-01):
# I found some references to the Mexican application of daylight
# saving, which modifies what I had already sent you, stating earlier
# that a number of northern Mexican states would go on daylight
# saving. The modification reverts this to only cover Baja California
# (Norte), while all other states (except Sonora, who has no daylight
# saving all year) will follow the original decree of president
# Vicente Fox, starting daylight saving May 6, 2001 and ending
# September 30, 2001.

# From Reuters (2001-09-04):
# Mexico's Supreme Court on Tuesday declared that daylight savings was
# unconstitutional in Mexico City, creating the possibility the
# capital will be in a different time zone from the rest of the nation
# next year....  The Supreme Court's ruling takes effect at 2:00
# a.m. (0800 GMT) on Sept. 30, when Mexico is scheduled to revert to
# standard time. "This is so residents of the Federal District are not
# subject to unexpected time changes," a statement from the court said.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2002-03-12):
# ... consulting my local grocery store(!) and my coworkers, they all insisted

# http://www.conae.gob.mx/ahorro/horaver2001_m1_2002.html (2002-02-20)

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Formerly there was an America/Ensenada zone, which differed from
# America/Tijuana only in that it did not observe DST from 1976
# through 1995.  This was as per Shanks (1999).  But Shanks & Pottenger say
# Ensenada did not observe DST from 1948 through 1975.  Guy Harris reports
# that the 1987 OAG says "Only Ensenada, Mexicali, San Felipe and
# Tijuana observe DST," which agrees with Shanks & Pottenger but implies that
# DST-observance was a town-by-town matter back then.  This concerns
# data after 1970 so most likely there should be at least one Zone
# other than America/Tijuana for Baja, but it's not clear yet what its
# name or contents should be.

# From Paul Eggert (2015-10-08):

# The transitions below are derived from P Chan's sources, except that the 1977
# through 1980 transitions are from Shanks & Pottenger since we have no better
# data there.  Of particular note, the 1944 DST regulation only advanced the
# time to "exactly three and a half hours later than Greenwich mean time", as
# opposed to "three hours" in the 1942 and 1943 regulations.

# Bermuda

# From Paul Eggert (2022-07-27):
# For 1899 Milne gives -4:19:18.3 as the meridian of the clock tower,
# Bermuda dockyard, Ireland I.  This agrees with standard offset given in the
# Daylight Saving Act, 1917 cited below.
# It is not known when this time became standard for Bermuda; guess 1890.
# The transition to -04 was specified by:

# From Paul Eggert (2013-02-21):
# Milne gives -5:28:50.45 for the observatory at Havana, -5:29:23.57
# for the port, and -5:30 for meteorological observations.
# For now, stick with Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Arthur David Olson (1999-03-29):
# The 1999-03-28 exhibition baseball game held in Havana, Cuba, between
# the Cuban National Team and the Baltimore Orioles was carried live on
# the Orioles Radio Network, including affiliate WTOP in Washington, DC.
# During the game, play-by-play announcer Jim Hunter noted that
# "We'll be losing two hours of sleep...Cuba switched to Daylight Saving
# Time today."  (The "two hour" remark referred to losing one hour of
# sleep on 1999-03-28 - when the announcers were in Cuba as it switched
# to DST - and one more hour on 1999-04-04 - when the announcers will have
# returned to Baltimore, which switches on that date.)

# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-11-11):
# DST start in Cuba in 2004 ... does not follow the same rules as the
# years before.  The correct date should be Sunday 2004-03-28 00:00 ...
# https://web.archive.org/web/20040402060750/http://www.granma.cu/espanol/2004/marzo/sab27/reloj.html

# From Evert van der Veer via Steffen Thorsen (2004-10-28):
# Cuba is not going back to standard time this year.
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2004/septiembre/juev30/41medid-i.html
# says that it's due to a problem at the Antonio Guiteras
# thermoelectric plant, and says "This October there will be no return
# to normal hours (after daylight saving time)".
# For now, let's assume that it's a temporary measure.

# From Carlos A. Carnero Delgado (2005-11-12):
# This year (just like in 2004-2005) there's no change in time zone
# adjustment in Cuba.  We will stay in daylight saving time:
# http://www.granma.cu/espanol/2005/noviembre/mier9/horario.html

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2006-10-21):
# An article in GRANMA INTERNACIONAL claims that Cuba will end
# the 3 years of permanent DST next weekend, see
# http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2006/octubre/lun16/43horario.html
# "On Saturday night, October 28 going into Sunday, October 29, at 01:00,
# watches should be set back one hour - going back to 00:00 hours - returning
# to the normal schedule....

# From Paul Eggert (2007-03-02):
# <http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu/english/news/art89.html>, dated yesterday,
# says Cuban clocks will advance at midnight on March 10.
# For lack of better information, assume Cuba will use US rules,
# except that it switches at midnight standard time as usual.
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2007-10-25):
# Carlos Alberto Fonseca Arauz informed me that Cuba will end DST one week
# earlier - on the last Sunday of October, just like in 2006.
#
# He supplied these references:

#
# From Alex Krivenyshev (2007-10-25):
# Here is also article from Granma (Cuba):
#
# Regirá el Horario Normal desde el próximo domingo 28 de octubre
# http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu/2007/10/24/nacional/artic07.html
#
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_cuba03.html

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-09):
# I'm in Maryland which is now observing United States Eastern Daylight
# Time. At 9:44 local time I used RealPlayer to listen to
# http://media.enet.cu/radioreloj
# a Cuban information station, and heard
# the time announced as "ocho cuarenta y cuatro" ("eight forty-four"),
# indicating that Cuba is still on standard time.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-03-12):
# It seems that Cuba will start DST on Sunday, 2007-03-16...
# It was announced yesterday, according to this source (in Spanish):
# http://www.nnc.cubaweb.cu/marzo-2008/cien-1-11-3-08.htm
#
# Some more background information is posted here:
# https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/cuba-starts-dst-march-16.html
#
# The article also says that Cuba has been observing DST since 1963,
# while Shanks (and tzdata) has 1965 as the first date (except in the
# 1940's). Many other web pages in Cuba also claim that it has been
# observed since 1963, but with the exception of 1970 - an exception
# which is not present in tzdata/Shanks. So there is a chance we need to
# change some historic records as well.
#
# One example:
# http://www.radiohc.cu/espanol/noticias/mar07/11mar/hor.htm

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-03-13):
# The Cuban time change has just been confirmed on the most authoritative
# web site, the Granma.  Please check out
# http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu/2008/03/13/nacional/artic10.html
#
# Basically as expected after Steffen Thorsen's information, the change
# will take place midnight between Saturday and Sunday.

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-12):
# Assume Sun>=15 (third Sunday) going forward.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2009-03-04)
# According to the Radio Reloj - Cuba will start Daylight Saving Time on
# midnight between Saturday, March 07, 2009 and Sunday, March 08, 2009-
# not on midnight March 14 / March 15 as previously thought.
#
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_cuba05.html
# (in Spanish)

# From Arthur David Olson (2009-03-09)
# I listened over the Internet to
# http://media.enet.cu/readioreloj
# this morning; when it was 10:05 a. m. here in Bethesda, Maryland the
# the time was announced as "diez cinco" - the same time as here, indicating
# that has indeed switched to DST. Assume second Sunday from 2009 forward.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2011-03-08):
# Granma announced that Cuba is going to start DST on 2011-03-20 00:00:00
# this year. Nothing about the end date known so far (if that has
# changed at all).

# From Paul Eggert (2000-12-04):

# From Rives McDow (2000-12-01):
# Dominican Republic changed its mind and presidential decree on Tuesday,
# November 28, 2000, with a new decree.  On Sunday, December 3 at 1:00 AM the
# Dominican Republic will be reverting to 8 hours from the International Date
# Line, and will not be using DST in the foreseeable future.  The reason they
# decided to use DST was to be in synch with Puerto Rico, who was also going
# to implement DST.  When Puerto Rico didn't implement DST, the president
# decided to revert.

# Haiti
# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-15):
# Risto O. Nykänen wrote me that Haiti is now on DST.
# I searched for confirmation, and I found a press release
# on the Web page of the Haitian Consulate in Chicago (2005-03-31),
# <http://www.haitianconsulate.org/time.doc>.  Translated from French, it says:
#
#  "The Prime Minister's Communication Office notifies the public in general
#   and the press in particular that, following a decision of the Interior
#   Ministry and the Territorial Collectivities [I suppose that means the
#   provinces], Haiti will move to Eastern Daylight Time in the night from next
#   Saturday the 2nd to Sunday the 3rd.
#
#  "Consequently, the Prime Minister's Communication Office wishes to inform
#   the population that the country's clocks will be set forward one hour
#   starting at midnight.  This provision will hold until the last Saturday in
#   October 2005.
#
#  "Port-au-Prince, March 31, 2005"
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-04-04):
# I have been informed by users that Haiti observes DST this year like
# last year, so the current "only" rule for 2005 might be changed to a
# "max" rule or to last until 2006. (Who knows if they will observe DST
# next year or if they will extend their DST like US/Canada next year).
#
# I have found this article about it (in French):
# http://www.haitipressnetwork.com/news.cfm?articleID=7612
#
# The reason seems to be an energy crisis.

# From Stephen Colebourne (2007-02-22):
# Some IATA info: Haiti won't be having DST in 2007.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2012-03-11):
# According to several news sources, Haiti will observe DST this year,
# apparently using the same start and end date as USA/Canada.
# So this means they have already changed their time.
#
# http://www.alterpresse.org/spip.php?article12510
# http://radiovision2000haiti.net/home/?p=13253
#
# From Arthur David Olson (2012-03-11):
# The alterpresse.org source seems to show a US-style leap from 2:00 a.m. to
# 3:00 a.m. rather than the traditional Haitian jump at midnight.
# Assume a US-style fall back as well.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-03-10):
# It appears that Haiti is observing DST this year as well, same rules
# as US/Canada.  They did it last year as well, and it looks like they
# are going to observe DST every year now...

# during the Arnoldo Alemán administration."...
# The northamerica file says that Nicaragua has been on UTC-6 continuously
# since December 1998.  I wasn't able to find any details of Nicaraguan time

#
# From Chris Dunn in

# (2007-03-15): In the Turks & Caicos Islands (America/Grand_Turk) the
# daylight saving dates for time changes have been adjusted to match
# the recent U.S. change of dates.
#
# From Brian Inglis (2007-04-28):
# http://www.turksandcaicos.tc/calendar/index.htm [2007-04-26]
# there is an entry for Nov 4 "Daylight Savings Time Ends 2007" and three
# rows before that there is an out of date entry for Oct:
# "Eastern Standard Times Begins 2007
# Clocks are set back one hour at 2:00 a.m. local Daylight Saving Time"
# indicating that the normal ET rules are followed.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-08-19):
# The 2014-08-13 Cabinet meeting decided to stay on UT -04 year-round.  See:

# "permanent daylight saving time" by one year....

# From the Turks & Caicos Cabinet (2017-07-20), heads-up from Steffen Thorsen:
# ... agreed to the reintroduction in TCI of Daylight Saving Time (DST)
# during the summer months and Standard Time, also known as Local
# Time, during the winter months with effect from April 2018 ...

# From Paul Eggert (2017-08-26):
# The date of effect of the spring 2018 change appears to be March 11,
# which makes more sense.  See: Hamilton D. Time change back
# by March 2018 for TCI. Magnetic Media. 2017-08-25.

# Standard Time Declaration Order 2017 (L.N. 31/2017)

#
# From Tim Parenti (2020-12-05):
# Although L.N. 31/2017 reads that it "shall come into operation at 2:00 a.m.
# on 11th March 2018", a precise interpretation here poses some problems.  The
# order states that "the standard time to be observed throughout the Turks and
# Caicos Islands shall be the same time zone as the Eastern United States of
# America" and further clarifies "[f]or the avoidance of doubt" that it
# "applies to the Eastern Standard Time as well as any changes thereto for
# Daylight Saving Time."  However, as clocks in Turks and Caicos approached
# 02:00 -04, and thus the declared implementation time, it was still 01:00 EST
# (-05), as DST in the Eastern US would not start until an hour later.
#
# Since it is unlikely that those on the islands switched their clocks twice in
# the span of an hour, we assume instead that the adoption of EDT actually took
# effect once clocks in the Eastern US had sprung forward, from 03:00 -04.
# This discrepancy only affects the time zone abbreviation and DST flag for the
# intervening hour, not wall clock times, as -04 was maintained throughout.
