# Queensland
#
# From Alex Livingston (1996-11-01):
# I have heard or read more than once that some resort islands off the coast
# of Queensland chose to keep observing daylight-saving time even after
# Queensland ceased to.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):
# IATA SSIM (1993-02/1994-09) say that the Holiday Islands (Hayman, Lindeman,
# Hamilton) observed DST for two years after the rest of Queensland stopped.
# Hamilton is the largest, but there is also a Hamilton in Victoria,
# so use Lindeman.
#
# From J William Piggott (2016-02-20):
# There is no location named Holiday Islands in Queensland Australia; holiday
# islands is a colloquial term used globally.  Hayman and Lindeman are at the
# north and south extremes of the Whitsunday Islands archipelago, and
# Hamilton is in between; it is reasonable to believe that this time zone
# applies to all of the Whitsundays.

# in the Government of Fiji Gazette Supplement No. 24 (2015-08-28),
# via Ken Rylander (2015-09-02):
# the daylight saving period is 1 hour in advance of the standard time
# commencing at 2.00 am on Sunday 1st November, 2015 and ending at
# 3.00 am on Sunday 17th January, 2016.

# From Raymond Kumar (2016-10-04):

# From Paul Eggert (2017-08-21):

# Extraordinary Government of Fiji Gazette Supplement No. 21 (2017-08-27),
# [Legal Notice No. 41] of an order of the previous day by J Usamate.

# From Raymond Kumar (2018-07-13):
# http://www.fijitimes.com/government-approves-2018-daylight-saving/

# From Paul Eggert (2019-08-06):
# Today Raymond Kumar reported the Government of Fiji Gazette Supplement No. 27
# (2019-08-02) said that Fiji observes DST "commencing at 2.00 am on
# Sunday, 10 November 2019 and ending at 3.00 am on Sunday, 12 January 2020."
# For now, guess DST from 02:00 the second Sunday in November to 03:00
# the first Sunday on or after January 12.  January transitions reportedly
# depend on when school terms start.  Although the guess is ad hoc, it matches
# transitions planned this year and seems more likely to match future practice

# In a 2021-10-10 speech concerning updated Covid-19 mitigation measures in
# Fiji, prime minister Josaia Voreqe "Frank" Bainimarama announced the
# suspension of DST for the 2021/2022 season: "Given that we are in the process
# of readjusting in the midst of so many changes, we will also put Daylight
# Savings Time on hold for this year. It will also make the reopening of
# scheduled commercial air service much smoother if we don't have to be
# concerned shifting arrival and departure times, which may look like a simple
# thing but requires some significant logistical adjustments domestically and
# internationally."

# From Shalvin Narayan (2022-10-27):
# Please note that there will not be any daylight savings time change
# in Fiji for 2022-2023....

# From Almaz Mingaleev (2023-10-06):
# Cabinet approved the suspension of Daylight Saving and appropriate
# legislative changes will be considered including the repeal of the
# Daylight Saving Act 1998
# https://www.fiji.gov.fj/Media-Centre/Speeches/English/CABINET-DECISIONS-3-OCTOBER-2023
#
# From Paul Eggert (2023-10-06):
# For now, assume DST is suspended indefinitely.

# Cook Is
#
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2021-03-24):
# In 1899 the Cook Islands celebrated Christmas twice to correct the calendar.
# According to the old books, missionaries were unaware of
# the International Date line, when they came from Sydney.
# Thus the Cook Islands were one day ahead....

# https://atojs.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/atojs?a=d&d=AJHR1900-I.2.1.2.3
# (page 20)
#
# From Michael Deckers (2021-03-24):
# ... in the Cook Island Act of 1915-10-11, online at
# http://www.paclii.org/ck/legis/ck-nz_act/cia1915132/
# "651. The hour of the day shall in each of the islands included in the
#  Cook Islands be determined in accordance with the meridian of that island."
# so that local (mean?) time was still used in Rarotonga (and Niue) in 1915.
# This was changed in the Cook Island Amendment Act of 1952-10-16 ...
# http://www.paclii.org/ck/legis/ck-nz_act/ciaa1952212/
# "651 (1) The hour of the day in each of the islands included in the Cook
#  Islands, other than Niue, shall be determined as if each island were
#  situated on the meridian one hundred and fifty-seven degrees thirty minutes
#  West of Greenwich.  (2) The hour of the day in the Island of Niue shall be
#  determined as if that island were situated on the meridian one hundred and
#  seventy degrees West of Greenwich."
# This act does not state when it takes effect, so one has to assume it
# applies since 1952-10-16.  But there is the possibility that the act just
# legalized prior existing practice, as we had seen with the Guernsey law of
# 1913-06-18 for the switch in 1909-04-19.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2021-03-24):
# Transitions after 1952 are from Shanks & Pottenger.

# US minor outlying islands

# Howland, Baker
# Howland was mined for guano by American companies 1857-1878 and British
# 1886-1891; Baker was similar but exact dates are not known.
# Inhabited by civilians 1935-1942; U.S. military bases 1943-1944;
# uninhabited thereafter.
# Howland observed Hawaii Standard Time (UT -10:30) in 1937;
# see page 206 of Elgen M. Long and Marie K. Long,
# Amelia Earhart: the Mystery Solved, Simon & Schuster (2000).
# So most likely Howland and Baker observed Hawaii Time from 1935
# until they were abandoned after the war.

# Jarvis
# Mined for guano by American companies 1857-1879 and British 1883?-1891?.
# Inhabited by civilians 1935-1942; IGY scientific base 1957-1958;
# uninhabited thereafter.
# no information; was probably like Pacific/Kiritimati

# Johnston
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-02-10):
# Sometimes Johnston kept Hawaii time, and sometimes it was an hour behind.
# Details are uncertain.  We have no data for Johnston after 1970, so
# treat it like Hawaii for now.  Since Johnston is now uninhabited,
# its link to Pacific/Honolulu is in the 'backward' file.
#
# In his memoirs of June 6th to October 4, 1945
# <http://www.315bw.org/Herb_Bach.htm> (2005), Herbert C. Bach writes,
# "We started our letdown to Kwajalein Atoll and landed there at 5:00 AM
# Johnston time, 1:30 AM Kwajalein time."  This was in June 1945, and
# confirms that Johnston kept the same time as Honolulu in summer 1945.
#
# From Lyle McElhaney (2014-03-11):
# [W]hen JI was being used for that [atomic bomb] testing, the time being used
# was not Hawaiian time but rather the same time being used on the ships,
# which had a GMT offset of -11 hours.  This apparently applied to at least the
# time from Operation Newsreel (Hardtack I/Teak shot, 1958-08-01) to the last
# Operation Fishbowl shot (Tightrope, 1962-11-04).... [See] Herman Hoerlin,
# "The United States High-Altitude Test Experience: A Review Emphasizing the
# Impact on the Environment", Los Alamos LA-6405, Oct 1976.
# https://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/docs1/00322994.pdf
# See the table on page 4 where he lists GMT and local times for the tests; a
# footnote for the JI tests reads that local time is "JI time = Hawaii Time
# Minus One Hour".

# Australia

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
# Daylight saving time has long been controversial in Australia, pitting
# region against region, rural against urban, and local against global.
# For example, in her review of Graeme Davison's _The Unforgiving
# Minute: how Australians learned to tell the time_ (1993), Perth native
# Phillipa J Martyr wrote, "The section entitled 'Saving Daylight' was
# very informative, but was (as can, sadly, only be expected from a
# Melbourne-based study) replete with the usual chuckleheaded
# Queenslanders and straw-chewing yokels from the West prattling fables
# about fading curtains and crazed farm animals."

# From Paul Eggert (2005-12-08):
# Implementation Dates of Daylight Saving Time within Australia
# http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/dst_times.shtml
# summarizes daylight saving issues in Australia.

# From Arthur David Olson (2005-12-12):
# Lawlink NSW:Daylight Saving in New South Wales
# http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Corporate/ll_agdinfo.nsf/pages/community_relations_daylight_saving
# covers New South Wales in particular.

# From John Mackin (1991-03-06):
# We in Australia have _never_ referred to DST as 'daylight' time.
# It is called 'summer' time.  Now by a happy coincidence, 'summer'
# and 'standard' happen to start with the same letter; hence, the
# abbreviation does _not_ change...
# The legislation does not actually define abbreviations, at least
# in this State, but the abbreviation is just commonly taken to be the
# initials of the phrase, and the legislation here uniformly uses
# the phrase 'summer time' and does not use the phrase 'daylight
# time'.
# Announcers on the Commonwealth radio network, the ABC (for Australian
# Broadcasting Commission), use the phrases 'Eastern Standard Time'
# or 'Eastern Summer Time'.  (Note, though, that as I say in the
# current australasia file, there is really no such thing.)  Announcers
# on its overseas service, Radio Australia, use the same phrases
# prefixed by the word 'Australian' when referring to local times;
# time announcements on that service, naturally enough, are made in UTC.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
#
# Inspired by Mackin's remarks quoted above, earlier versions of this
# file used "EST" for both Eastern Standard Time and Eastern Summer
# Time in Australia, and similarly for "CST", "CWST", and "WST".
# However, these abbreviations were confusing and were not common
# practice among Australians, and there were justifiable complaints
# about them, so I attempted to survey current Australian usage.
# For the tz database, the full English phrase is not that important;
# what matters is the abbreviation.  It's difficult to survey the web
# directly for abbreviation usage, as there are so many false hits for
# strings like "EST" and "EDT", so I looked for pages that defined an
# abbreviation for eastern or central DST in Australia, and got the
# following numbers of unique hits for the listed Google queries:
#
#   10 "Eastern Daylight Time AEST" site:au [some are false hits]
#   10 "Eastern Summer Time AEST" site:au
#   10 "Summer Time AEDT" site:au
#   13 "EDST Eastern Daylight Saving Time" site:au
#   18 "Summer Time ESST" site:au
#   28 "Eastern Daylight Saving Time EDST" site:au
#   39 "EDT Eastern Daylight Time" site:au [some are false hits]
#   53 "Eastern Daylight Time EDT" site:au [some are false hits]
#   54 "AEDT Australian Eastern Daylight Time" site:au
#  182 "Eastern Daylight Time AEDT" site:au
#
#   17 "Central Daylight Time CDT" site:au [some are false hits]
#   46 "Central Daylight Time ACDT" site:au
#
# I tried several other variants (e.g., "Eastern Summer Time EST") but
# they all returned fewer than 10 unique hits.  I also looked for pages
# mentioning both "western standard time" and an abbreviation, since
# there is no WST in the US to generate false hits, and found:
#
#  156 "western standard time" AWST site:au
#  226 "western standard time" WST site:au
#
# I then surveyed the top ten newspapers in Australia by circulation as
# listed in Wikipedia, using Google queries like "AEDT site:heraldsun.com.au"
# and obtaining estimated counts from the initial page of search results.
# All ten papers greatly preferred "AEDT" to "EDT".  The papers
# surveyed were the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Courier-Mail,
# The Sydney Morning Herald, The West Australian, The Age, The Advertiser,
# The Australian, The Financial Review, and The Herald (Newcastle).
#
# I also searched for historical usage, to see whether abbreviations
# like "AEDT" are new.  A Trove search <http://trove.nla.gov.au/>
# found only one newspaper (The Canberra Times) with a house style
# dating back to the 1970s, I expect because other newspapers weren't
# fully indexed.  The Canberra Times strongly preferred abbreviations
# like "AEDT".  The first occurrence of "AEDT" was a World Weather
# column (1971-11-17, page 24), and of "ACDT" was a Scoreboard column
# (1993-01-24, p 16).  The style was the typical usage but was not
# strictly enforced; for example, "Welcome to the twilight zones ..."
# (1994-10-29, p 1) uses the abbreviations AEST/AEDT, CST/CDT, and
# WST, and goes on to say, "The confusion and frustration some feel
# about the lack of uniformity among Australia's six states and two
# territories has prompted one group to form its very own political
# party -- the Sydney-based Daylight Saving Extension Party."
#
# I also surveyed federal government sources.  They did not agree:
#
#   The Australian Government (2014-03-26)
#   http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-country/time
#   (This document was produced by the Department of Finance.)

#   http://www.ga.gov.au/geodesy/astro/sunrise.jsp
#   AEST ACST AWST AEDT ACDT
#
#   Parliamentary Library (2008-11-10)
#   https://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/rp/2008-09/09rp14.pdf
#   EST CST WST preferred for standard time; AEST AEDT ACST ACDT also used
#
#   The Transport Safety Bureau has an extensive series of accident reports,
#   and investigators seem to use whatever abbreviation they like.
#   Googling site:atsb.gov.au found the following number of unique hits:
#   311 "ESuT", 195 "EDT", 26 "AEDT", 83 "CSuT", 46 "CDT".
#   "_SuT" tended to appear in older reports, and "A_DT" tended to
#   appear in reports of events with international implications.
#
# From the above it appears that there is a working consensus in
# Australia to use trailing "DT" for daylight saving time; although
# some sources use trailing "SST" or "ST" or "SuT" they are by far in
# the minority.  The case for leading "A" is weaker, but since it
# seems to be preferred in the overall web and is preferred in all
# the leading newspaper websites and in many government departments,
# it has a stronger case than omitting the leading "A".  The current
# version of the database therefore uses abbreviations like "AEST" and
# "AEDT" for Australian time zones.

# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
# Shanks & Pottenger report 2:00 for all autumn changes in Australia and NZ.
# Mark Prior writes that his newspaper
# reports that NSW's fall 1995 change will occur at 2:00,
# but Robert Elz says it's been 3:00 in Victoria since 1970
# and perhaps the newspaper's '2:00' is referring to standard time.
# For now we'll continue to assume 2:00s for changes since 1960.

# From Paul Eggert (2018-04-01):
# The Guardian Express of Perth, Australia reported today that the
# government decided to advance the clocks permanently on January 1,
# 2019, from UT +08 to UT +09.  The article noted that an exemption
# would be made for people aged 61 and over, who "can apply in writing
# to have the extra hour of sunshine removed from their area."  See:
# Daylight saving coming to WA in 2019. Guardian Express. 2018-04-01.

# The Australian Bureau of Meteorology FAQ
# http://www.bom.gov.au/faq/faqgen.htm
# (1999-09-27) writes that Giles Meteorological Station uses
# South Australian time even though it's located in Western Australia.

# From Rives McDow (2002-04-09):
# The most interesting region I have found consists of three towns on the
# southern coast....  South Australia observes daylight saving time; Western
# Australia does not.  The two states are one and a half hours apart.  The
# residents decided to forget about this nonsense of changing the clock so
# much and set the local time 20 hours and 45 minutes from the
# international date line, or right in the middle of the time of South
# Australia and Western Australia....
#
# From Paul Eggert (2002-04-09):
# This is confirmed by the section entitled
# "What's the deal with time zones???" in
# http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~awatkins/null.html
#
# From Alex Livingston (2006-12-07):
# ... it was just on four years ago that I drove along the Eyre Highway,
# which passes through eastern Western Australia close to the southern
# coast of the continent.
#
# I paid particular attention to the time kept there. There can be no
# dispute that UTC+08:45 was considered "the time" from the border
# village just inside the border with South Australia to as far west
# as just east of Caiguna. There can also be no dispute that Eucla is
# the largest population centre in this zone....
#
# Now that Western Australia is observing daylight saving, the
# question arose whether this part of the state would follow suit. I
# just called the border village and confirmed that indeed they have,
# meaning that they are now observing UTC+09:45.
#
# (2006-12-09):
# I personally doubt that either experimentation with daylight saving
# in WA or its introduction in SA had anything to do with the genesis
# of this time zone.  My hunch is that it's been around since well
# before 1975.  I remember seeing it noted on road maps decades ago.

# "The time zone exists for about 340 kilometres and takes in the tiny
# roadhouse communities of Cocklebiddy, Madura, Eucla and Border Village."
# ... and an indication that the zone has definitely been in existence
# since before the 1970 cut-off of the database ...
# From Paul Eggert (2019-05-17):
# That ABC Esperance story by Christien de Garis also says:
#    Although the Central Western Time Zone is not officially recognised (your
#    phones won't automatically change), there is a sign instructing you which
#    way to wind your clocks 45 minutes and scrawled underneath one of them in
#    Texta is the word: 'Why'?
#    "Good question," Mr Pike said.
#    "I don't even know that, and it's been going for over 50 years."

# From Paul Eggert (2006-12-15):
# For lack of better info, assume the tradition dates back to the
# introduction of standard time in 1895.

# From Scott Harrington (2001-08-29):
# On KQED's "City Arts and Lectures" program last night I heard an

# discussing his book "The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar
# Observatories"[1], and in particular the Shrine of Remembrance[2] located
# in Melbourne, Australia.
#
# Apparently the shrine's main purpose is a beam of sunlight which
# illuminates a special spot on the floor at the 11th hour of the 11th day
# of the 11th month (Remembrance Day) every year in memory of Australia's
# fallen WWI soldiers.  And if you go there on Nov. 11, at 11am local time,
# you will indeed see the sunbeam illuminate the special spot at the
# expected time.
#
# However, that is only because of some special mirror contraption that had
# to be employed, since due to daylight savings time, the true solar time of
# the remembrance moment occurs one hour later (or earlier?).  Perhaps
# someone with more information on this jury-rig can tell us more.

# New South Wales

# From Arthur David Olson:
# New South Wales and subjurisdictions have their own ideas of a fun time.
# Based on law library research by John Mackin,
# who notes:
#	In Australia, time is not legislated federally, but rather by the
#	individual states.  Thus, while such terms as "Eastern Standard Time"
#	[I mean, of course, Australian EST, not any other kind] are in common
#	use, _they have NO REAL MEANING_, as they are not defined in the
#	legislation.  This is very important to understand.
#	I have researched New South Wales time only...

# From Eric Ulevik (1999-05-26):

# Lord Howe Island is located off the New South Wales coast, and is half an
# hour ahead of NSW time.

# From James Lonergan, Secretary, Lord Howe Island Board (2000-01-27):
# Lord Howe Island summer time in 2000/2001 will commence on the same
# date as the rest of NSW (i.e. 2000-08-27).  For your information the
# Lord Howe Island Board (controlling authority for the Island) is
# seeking the community's views on various options for summer time
# arrangements on the Island, e.g. advance clocks by 1 full hour
# instead of only 30 minutes.  [Dependent] on the wishes of residents
# the Board may approach the NSW government to change the existing
# arrangements.  The starting date for summer time on the Island will
# however always coincide with the rest of NSW.

# From James Lonergan, Secretary, Lord Howe Island Board (2000-10-25):
# Lord Howe Island advances clocks by 30 minutes during DST in NSW and retards
# clocks by 30 minutes when DST finishes. Since DST was most recently
# introduced in NSW, the "changeover" time on the Island has been 02:00 as
# shown on clocks on LHI. I guess this means that for 30 minutes at the start
# of DST, LHI is actually 1 hour ahead of the rest of NSW.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# For Lord Howe dates we use Shanks & Pottenger through 1989, and
# Lonergan thereafter.  For times we use Lonergan.

# From Paul Eggert (2007-07-23):
# See "southeast Australia" above for 2008 and later.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2009-04-28):
# According to the official press release, South Australia's extended daylight

# summer (southern hemisphere).

# Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands and Marcus Island (Minami-Tori-shima)

# From Wakaba (2019-01-28) via Phake Nick:
# National Diet Library of Japan has several reports by Japanese Government
# officers that describe the time used in islands when they visited there.
# According to them (and other sources such as newspapers), standard time UTC
# + 10 (JST + 1) and DST UTC + 11 (JST + 2) was used until its return to Japan
# at 1968-06-26 00:00 JST.  The exact periods of DST are still unknown.
# I guessed Guam, Mariana, and Bonin and Marcus districts might have
# synchronized their DST periods, but reports imply they had their own
# decisions, i.e. there were three or more different time zones....
#
# https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/小笠原諸島の標準時

# From Phake Nick (2019-02-12):
# Because their last time change to return to Japanese time when they returned

# rule, the information doesn't warrant creation of a new timezone for Bonin
# Islands itself and is thus as an anecdotal note for interest purpose only.
# ... [The abovementioned link] described some special timekeeping phenomenon
# regarding Marcus island, another remote island currently owned by Japanese
# in the same administrative unit as Bonin Islands.  Many reports claim that
# the American coastal guard on the American quarter of the island use its own
# coastal guard time, and most sources describe the time as UTC+11, being two
# hours faster than JST used by some Japanese personnel on the island.  Some
# sites describe it as same as Wake Island/Guam time although it would be
# incorrect to be same as Guam.  And then in a few Japanese governmental
# report from 1980s (from National Institute of Information and Communications
# Technology) regarding the construction of VLBI facility on the Marcus
# Island, it claimed that there are three time standards being used on the
# island at the time which include not just JST (UTC+9) or [US]CG time
# (UTC+11) but also a JMSDF time (UTC+10) (Japan Maritime Self-Defense
# Force).  Unfortunately there are no other sources that mentioned such time
# and there are also no information on things like how the time was used.


# Fiji

# Howse writes (p 153) that in 1879 the British governor of Fiji
# enacted an ordinance standardizing the islands on Antipodean Time
# instead of the American system (which was one day behind).

# From Rives McDow (1998-10-08):
# Fiji will introduce DST effective 0200 local time, 1998-11-01
# until 0300 local time 1999-02-28.  Each year the DST period will
# be from the first Sunday in November until the last Sunday in February.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-01-08):
# IATA SSIM (1999-09) says DST ends 0100 local time.  Go with McDow.

# From the BBC World Service in
# http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/205226.stm (1998-10-31 16:03 UTC):
# The Fijian government says the main reasons for the time change is to
# improve productivity and reduce road accidents.... [T]he move is also
# intended to boost Fiji's ability to attract tourists to witness the dawning

# Kiribati

# From Paul Eggert (1996-01-22):

# "declared it the same day [throughout] the country as of Jan. 1, 1995"
# as part of the competition to be first into the 21st century.

# From Kerry Shetline (2018-02-03):
# December 31 was the day that was skipped, so that the transition
# would be from Friday December 30, 1994 to Sunday January 1, 1995.

# Kanton

# From Paul Eggert (2021-05-27):
# Kiribati's +13 timezone is represented by Kanton, its only populated
# island.  (It was formerly spelled "Canton", but Gilbertese lacks "C".)
# Kanton was settled on 1937-08-31 by two British radio operators
# <https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1937v02/d94>;
# Americans came the next year and built an airfield, partly to
# establish airline service and perhaps partly anticipating the
# next war.  Aside from the war, the airfield was used by commercial
# airlines until long-range jets became standard; although currently
# for emergency use only, China says it is considering rebuilding the
# airfield for high-end niche tourism.  Kanton has about two dozen
# people, caretakers who rotate in from the rest of Kiribati in 2-5
# year shifts, and who use some of the leftover structures
# <http://pipa.neaq.org/2012/06/images-of-kanton-island.html>.

# Kwajalein

# From an AP article (1993-08-22):
# "The nearly 3,000 Americans living on this remote Pacific atoll have a good
# excuse for not remembering Saturday night: there wasn't one.  Residents were
# going to bed Friday night and waking up Sunday morning because at midnight
# -- 8 A.M. Eastern daylight time on Saturday -- Kwajalein was jumping from
# one side of the international date line to the other."
# "In Marshall Islands, Friday is followed by Sunday", NY Times. 1993-08-22.
# https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/world/in-marshall-islands-friday-is-followed-by-sunday.html

# From Paul Eggert (2022-03-31):
# Phake Nick (2018-10-27) noted <https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/南洋群島の標準時>'s
# citation of a 1993 AP article published in the New York Times saying
# Kwajalein synchronized its day with the US mainland about 40 years earlier.
# However the AP article is vague and possibly wrong about this.  The article
# says the earlier switch was "about 40 years ago when the United States
# Army established a missile test range here".  However, the Kwajalein Test
# Center was established on 1960-10-01 and was run by the US Navy.  It was
# transferred to the US Army on 1964-07-01.  See "Seize the High Ground"
# <https://history.army.mil/html/books/070/70-88-1/cmhPub_70-88-1.pdf>.
# Given that Shanks was right on the money about the 1993 change, I'm inclined
# to take Shanks's word for the 1969 change unless we find better evidence.


# N Mariana Is, Guam

# From Phake Nick (2018-10-27):
# Guam Island was briefly annexed by Japan during ... year 1941-1944 ...
# however there are no detailed information about what time it use during that
# period.  It would probably be reasonable to assume Guam use GMT+9 during
# that period of time like the surrounding area.

# From Paul Eggert (2023-01-23):
# Howse writes (p 153) "The Spaniards, on the other hand, reached the
# Philippines and the Ladrones from America," and implies that the Ladrones
# (now called the Marianas) kept American date for quite some time.
# For now, we assume the Ladrones switched at the same time as the Philippines;
# see Asia/Manila.
#
# Use 1941-12-10 and 1944-07-31 for Guam WWII transitions, as the rough start
# and end of Japanese control of Agana.  We don't know whether the Northern
# Marianas followed Guam's DST rules from 1959 through 1977; for now, assume
# they did as that avoids the need for a separate zone due to our 1970 cutoff.
#
# US Public Law 106-564 (2000-12-23) made UT +10 the official standard time,
# under the name "Chamorro standard time".  There is no official abbreviation,
# but Congressman Robert A. Underwood, author of the bill that became law,
# wrote in a press release (2000-12-27) that he will seek the use of "ChST".

# See also the commentary for Micronesia.


# Marshall Is
# See the commentary for Micronesia.


# Micronesia (and nearby)

# From Paul Eggert (2018-11-18):
# Like the Ladrones (see Guam commentary), assume the Spanish East Indies
# kept American time until the Philippines switched at the end of 1844.

# From Paul Eggert (1999-10-29):
# The Federated States of Micronesia Visitors Board writes in
# The Federated States of Micronesia - Visitor Information (1999-01-26)
# http://www.fsmgov.org/info/clocks.html
# that Truk and Yap are UT +10, and Ponape and Kosrae are +11.
# We don't know when Kosrae switched from +12; assume January 1 for now.

# From Phake Nick (2018-10-27):
#
# From a Japanese wiki site https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/南洋群島の標準時
# ...
# For "Southern Islands" (modern region of Mariana + Palau + Federation of
# Micronesia + Marshall Islands):
#
# A 1906 Japanese magazine shown the Caroline Islands and Mariana Islands
# who was occupied by Germany at the time as GMT+10, together with the like
# of German New Guinea.  However there is a marking saying it have not been
# implemented (yet).  No further information after that were found.
#
# Japan invaded those islands in 1914, and records shows that they were
# instructed to use JST at the time.
#
# 1915 January telecommunication record on the Jaluit Atoll shows they use
# the meridian of 170E as standard time (GMT+11:20), which is similar to the
# longitude of the atoll.
# 1915 February record say the 170E standard time is to be used until
# February 9 noon, and after February 9 noon they are to use JST.
# However these are time used within the Japanese Military at the time and
# probably does not reflect the time used by local resident at the time (that
# is if they keep their own time back then)
#
# In January 1919 the occupying force issued a command that split the area
# into three different timezone with meridian of 135E, 150E, 165E (JST+0, +1,
# +2), and the command was to become effective from February 1 of the same
# year.  Despite the target of the command is still only for the occupying
# force itself, further publication have described the time as the standard
# time for the occupied area and thus it can probably be seen as such.
#  * Area that use meridian of 135E: Palau and Yap civil administration area
#    (Southern Islands Western Standard Time)
#  * Area that use meridian of 150E: Truk (Chuuk) and Saipan civil
#    administration area (Southern Islands Central Standard Time)
#  * Area that use meridian of 165E: Ponape (Pohnpei) and Jaluit civil
#    administration area (Southern Islands Eastern Standard Time).
#  * In the next few years Japanese occupation of those islands have been
#    formalized via League of Nation Mandate (South Pacific Mandate) and formal
#    governance structure have been established, these district [become
#    subprefectures] and timezone classification have been inherited as standard
#    time of the area.
#  * Saipan subprefecture include Mariana islands (exclude Guam which was
#    occupied by America at the time), Palau and Yap subprefecture rule the
#    Western Caroline Islands with 137E longitude as border, Truk and Ponape
#    subprefecture rule the Eastern Caroline Islands with 154E as border, Ponape
#    subprefecture also rule part of Marshall Islands to the west of 164E
#    starting from (1918?) and Jaluit subprefecture rule the rest of the
#    Marshall Islands.
#
# And then in year 1937, an announcement was made to change the time in the
# area into 2 timezones:
#  * Area that use meridian of 135E: area administered by Palau, Yap and
#    Saipan subprefecture (Southern Islands Western Standard Time)
#  * Area that use meridian of 150E: area administered by Truk (Chuuk),
#    Ponape (Pohnpei) and Jaluit subprefecture (Southern Islands Eastern
#    Standard Time)
#
# Another announcement issued in 1941 say that on April 1 that year,
# standard time of the Southern Islands would be changed to use the meridian
# of 135E (GMT+9), and thus abolishing timezone different within the area.
#
# Then Pacific theater of WWII started and Japan slowly lose control on the
# island.  The webpage I linked above contain no information during this
# period of time....
#
# After the end of WWII, in 1946 February, a document written by the
# (former?) Japanese military personnel describe there are 3 hours time
# different between Caroline islands time/Wake island time and the Chungking
# time, which would mean the time being used there at the time was GMT+10.
#
# After that, the area become Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands
# under American administration from year 1947.  The site listed some
# American/International books/maps/publications about time used in those
# area during this period of time but they doesn't seems to be reliable
# information so it would be the best if someone know where can more reliable
# information can be found.
#
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-11-18):
#
# For the above, use vague dates like "1914" and "1945" for transitions that
# plausibly exist but for which the details are not known.  The information
# for Wake is too sketchy to act on.
#
# The 1906 GMT+10 info about German-controlled islands might not have been
# done, so omit it from the data for now.
#
# The Jaluit info governs Kwajalein.


# Midway

# From Charles T O'Connor, KMTH DJ (1956),
# quoted in the KTMH section of the Radio Heritage Collection
# <http://radiodx.com/spdxr/KMTH.htm> (2002-12-31):
# For the past two months we've been on what is known as Daylight
# Saving Time.  This time has put us on air at 5am in the morning,
# your time down there in New Zealand.  Starting September 2, 1956
# we'll again go back to Standard Time.  This'll mean that we'll go to
# air at 6am your time.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2003-03-23):
# We don't know the date of that quote, but we'll guess they
# started DST on June 3.  Possibly DST was observed other years
# in Midway, but we have no record of it.

# Nauru

# From Phake Nick (2018-10-31):
# Currently, the tz database say Nauru use LMT until 1921, and then
# switched to GMT+11:30 for the next two decades.
# However, a number of timezone map published in America/Japan back then
# showed its timezone as GMT+11 per https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/ナウルの標準時
# And it would also be nice if the 1921 transition date could be sourced.

# Pitcairn

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-08):
# A Proclamation was signed by the Governor of Pitcairn on the 27th March 1998
# with regard to Pitcairn Standard Time.  The Proclamation is as follows.
#
#	The local time for general purposes in the Islands shall be
#	Co-ordinated Universal time minus 8 hours and shall be known
#	as Pitcairn Standard Time.
#
# ... I have also seen Pitcairn listed as UTC minus 9 hours in several
# references, and can only assume that this was an error in interpretation
# somehow in light of this proclamation.

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-09):
# The Proclamation regarding Pitcairn time came into effect on 27 April 1998
# ... at midnight.

# From Howie Phelps (1999-11-10), who talked to a Pitcairner via shortwave:
# Betty Christian told me yesterday that their local time is the same as
# Pacific Standard Time. They used to be ½ hour different from us here in
# Sacramento but it was changed a couple of years ago.


# (Western) Samoa and American Samoa

# Howse writes (p 153) that after the 1879 standardization on Antipodean
# time by the British governor of Fiji, the King of Samoa decided to change
# "the date in his kingdom from the Antipodean to the American system,
# ordaining - by a masterpiece of diplomatic flattery - that
# the Fourth of July should be celebrated twice in that year."
# This happened in 1892, according to the Evening News (Sydney) of 1892-07-20.
# https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/idl/idl_alaska_samoa.htm

# Although Shanks & Pottenger says they both switched to UT -11:30
# in 1911, and to -11 in 1950. many earlier sources give -11
# for American Samoa, e.g., the US National Bureau of Standards
# circular "Standard Time Throughout the World", 1932.
# Assume American Samoa switched to -11 in 1911, not 1950,
# and that after 1950 they agreed until (western) Samoa skipped a
# day in 2011.  Assume also that the Samoas follow the US and New
# Zealand's "ST"/"DT" style of daylight-saving abbreviations.


# Tonga

# From Paul Eggert (2021-03-04):
# In 1943 "The standard time kept is 12 hrs. 19 min. 12 sec. fast
# on Greenwich mean time." according to the Admiralty's Hydrographic
# Dept., Pacific Islands Pilot, Vol. II, 7th ed., 1943, p 360.

# From Michael Deckers (2021-03-03):
# [Ian R Bartky: "One Time Fits All: The Campaigns for Global Uniformity".
# Stanford University Press. 2007. p. 255]:
# On 10 September 1945 Tonga adopted a standard time 12 hours,
# 20 minutes in advance of Greenwich.

# From Paul Eggert (1996-01-22):
# Today's _Wall Street Journal_ (p 1) reports that "Tonga has been plotting
# to sneak ahead of [New Zealanders] by introducing daylight-saving time."
# Since Kiribati has moved the Date Line it's not clear what Tonga will do.

# Don Mundell writes in the 1997-02-20 Tonga Chronicle
# How Tonga became 'The Land where Time Begins':
# http://www.tongatapu.net.to/tonga/homeland/timebegins.htm
#
# Until 1941 Tonga maintained a standard time 50 minutes ahead of NZST
# 12 hours and 20 minutes ahead of GMT.  When New Zealand adjusted its
# standard time in 1940s, Tonga had the choice of subtracting from its
# local time to come on the same standard time as New Zealand or of
# advancing its time to maintain the differential of 13°
# (approximately 50 minutes ahead of New Zealand time).
#
# Because His Majesty King Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV, then Crown Prince
# Tungī, preferred to ensure Tonga's title as the land where time
# begins, the Legislative Assembly approved the latter change.
#
# But some of the older, more conservative members from the outer
# islands objected. "If at midnight on Dec. 31, we move ahead 40
# minutes, as your Royal Highness wishes, what becomes of the 40
# minutes we have lost?"
#
# The Crown Prince, presented an unanswerable argument: "Remember that
# on the World Day of Prayer, you would be the first people on Earth
# to say your prayers in the morning."
#
# From Tim Parenti (2021-09-13), per Paul Eggert (2006-03-22) and Michael
# Deckers (2021-03-03):
# Mundell places the transition from +12:20 to +13 in 1941, while Shanks &
# Pottenger say the transition was on 1968-10-01.
#
# The Air Almanac published contemporaneous tables of standard times,
# which listed +12:20 as of Nov 1960 and +13 as of Mar 1961:
#   Nov 1960: https://books.google.com/books?id=bVgtWM6kPZUC&pg=SL1-PA19
#   Mar 1961: https://books.google.com/books?id=W2nItAul4g0C&pg=SL1-PA19
# (Thanks to P Chan for pointing us toward these sources.)
# This agrees with Bartky, who writes that "since 1961 [Tonga's] official time
# has been thirteen hours in advance of Greenwich time" (p. 202) and further
# writes in an endnote that this was because "the legislation was amended" on
# 1960-10-19. (p. 255)
#
# Without greater specificity, presume that Bartky and the Air Almanac point to
# a 1961-01-01 transition, as Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV was still Crown Prince in
# 1961 and this still jives with the gist of Mundell's telling, and go with
# this over Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Eric Ulevik (1999-05-03):
# Tonga's director of tourism, who is also secretary of the National Millennium
# Committee, has a plan to get Tonga back in front.
# He has proposed a one-off move to tropical daylight saving for Tonga from
# October to March, which has won approval in principle from the Tongan
# Government.

# From Steffen Thorsen (1999-09-09):
# * Tonga will introduce DST in November
#
# I was given this link by John Letts:
# http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/asia-pacific/newsid_424000/424764.stm
#
# I have not been able to find exact dates for the transition in November
# yet. By reading this article it seems like Fiji will be 14 hours ahead
# of UTC as well, but as far as I know Fiji will only be 13 hours ahead
# (12 + 1 hour DST).

# From Arthur David Olson (1999-09-20):
# According to <http://www.tongaonline.com/news/sept1799.html>:
# "Daylight Savings Time will take effect on Oct. 2 through April 15, 2000
# and annually thereafter from the first Saturday in October through the
# third Saturday of April.  Under the system approved by Privy Council on
# Sept. 10, clocks must be turned ahead one hour on the opening day and
# set back an hour on the closing date."
# Alas, no indication of the time of day.

# From Rives McDow (1999-10-06):
# Tonga started its Daylight Saving on Saturday morning October 2nd at 0200am.
# Daylight Saving ends on April 16 at 0300am which is Sunday morning.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2000-10-31):
# Back in March I found a notice on the website http://www.tongaonline.com
# that Tonga changed back to standard time one month early, on March 19
# instead of the original reported date April 16. Unfortunately, the article
# is no longer available on the site, and I did not make a copy of the
# text, and I have forgotten to report it here.
# (Original URL was <http://www.tongaonline.com/news/march162000.htm>)

# From Rives McDow (2000-12-01):
# Tonga is observing DST as of 2000-11-04 and will stop on 2001-01-27.

# From Sione Moala-Mafi (2001-09-20) via Rives McDow:
# At 2:00am on the first Sunday of November, the standard time in the Kingdom
# shall be moved forward by one hour to 3:00am.  At 2:00am on the last Sunday
# of January the standard time in the Kingdom shall be moved backward by one
# hour to 1:00am.

#
# From Tim Parenti (2016-10-26):
# Assume Tonga will observe DST from the first Sunday in November at 02:00
# through the third Sunday in January at 03:00, like Fiji, for now.

# From David Wade (2017-10-18):
# In August government was dissolved by the King.  The current prime minister

#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-10-18):
# For now, guess that DST is discontinued.  That's what the IATA is guessing.


###############################################################################

# The International Date Line

# From Gwillim Law (2000-01-03):
#
# The International Date Line is not defined by any international standard,
# convention, or treaty.  Mapmakers are free to draw it as they please.
# Reputable mapmakers will simply ensure that every point of land appears on
# the correct side of the IDL, according to the date legally observed there.
#
# When Kiribati adopted a uniform date in 1995, thereby moving the Phoenix and
# Line Islands to the west side of the IDL (or, if you prefer, moving the IDL
# to the east side of the Phoenix and Line Islands), I suppose that most
# mapmakers redrew the IDL following the boundary of Kiribati.  Even that line
# has a rather arbitrary nature.  The straight-line boundaries between Pacific
# island nations that are shown on many maps are based on an international
# convention, but are not legally binding national borders.... The date is
# governed by the IDL; therefore, even on the high seas, there may be some
# places as late as fourteen hours later than UTC.  And, since the IDL is not
# an international standard, there are some places on the high seas where the
# correct date is ambiguous.

# From Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_time> (2023-01-23):
# The nautical time zone system is analogous to the terrestrial time zone
# system for use on high seas.  Under the system time changes are required for
# changes of longitude in one-hour steps.  The one-hour step corresponds to a
# time zone width of 15° longitude.  The 15° gore that is offset from GMT or
# UT1 (not UTC) by twelve hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two
# 7°30' gores that differ from GMT by ±12 hours.  A nautical date line is
# implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps.  It follows the 180th
# meridian except where it is interrupted by territorial waters adjacent to
# land, forming gaps: it is a pole-to-pole dashed line.

# From Paul Eggert (2023-01-23):
# The American Practical Navigator <https://msi.nga.mil/Publications/APN>,
# 2019 edition, merely says that the International Date Line
