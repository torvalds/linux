#	ATOMIC TIME
#	Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the reference time scale derived
#	from The "Temps Atomique International" (TAI) calculated by the Bureau
#	International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) using a worldwide network of atomic
#	clocks. UTC differs from TAI by an integer number of seconds; it is the basis
#	of all activities in the world.
#
#
#	ASTRONOMICAL TIME (UT1) is the time scale based on the rate of rotation of the earth.
#	It is now mainly derived from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). The various
#	irregular fluctuations progressively detected in the rotation rate of the Earth led
#	in 1972 to the replacement of UT1 by UTC as the reference time scale.
#
#
#	LEAP SECOND
#	Atomic clocks are more stable than the rate of the earth's rotation since the latter
#	undergoes a full range of geophysical perturbations at various time scales: lunisolar
#	and core-mantle torques, atmospheric and oceanic effects, etc.
#	Leap seconds are needed to keep the two time scales in agreement, i.e. UT1-UTC smaller
#	than 0.9 seconds. Therefore, when necessary a "leap second" is applied to UTC.
#	Since the adoption of this system in 1972 it has been necessary to add a number of seconds to UTC,
#	firstly due to the initial choice of the value of the second (1/86400 mean solar day of
#	the year 1820) and secondly to the general slowing down of the Earth's rotation. It is
#	theoretically possible to have a negative leap second (a second removed from UTC), but so far,
#	all leap seconds have been positive (a second has been added to UTC). Based on what we know about
#	the earth's rotation, it is unlikely that we will ever have a negative leap second.
#
#
#	HISTORY
#	The first leap second was added on June 30, 1972. Until the year 2000, it was necessary in average to add a
#       leap second at a rate of 1 to 2 years. Since the year 2000 leap seconds are introduced with an
#	average interval of 3 to 4 years due to the acceleration of the Earth's rotation speed.
#
#
#	RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DECISION TO INTRODUCE A LEAP SECOND IN UTC
#	The decision to introduce a leap second in UTC is the responsibility of the Earth Orientation Center of
#	the International Earth Rotation and reference System Service (IERS). This center is located at Paris
#	Observatory. According to international agreements, leap seconds should be scheduled only for certain dates:
#	first preference is given to the end of December and June, and second preference at the end of March
#	and September. Since the introduction of leap seconds in 1972, only dates in June and December were used.
