# Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
# Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
#
# Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
# for time zone data was the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
# IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.

# Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
# Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
# I found in the UCLA library.

# Armenia
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger have Yerevan switching to 3:00 (with Russian DST)
# in spring 1991, then to 4:00 with no DST in fall 1995, then
# readopting Russian DST in 1997.  Go with Shanks & Pottenger, even
# when they disagree with others.  Edgar Der-Danieliantz
# reported (1996-05-04) that Yerevan probably wouldn't use DST
# in 1996, though it did use DST in 1995.  IATA SSIM (1991/1998) reports that
# Armenia switched from 3:00 to 4:00 in 1998 and observed DST after 1991,
# but started switching at 3:00s in 1998.

# on April 11, 1919, newspaper in Shanghai said clocks in Shanghai will spring

# From Paul Eggert (2018-10-02):
# The following comes from Table 1 of:
# Li Yu. Research on the daylight saving movement in 1940s Shanghai.
# Nanjing Journal of Social Sciences. 2014;(2):144-50.
# http://oversea.cnki.net/kns55/detail.aspx?dbname=CJFD2014&filename=NJSH201402020
# The table lists dates only; I am guessing 00:00 and 24:00 transition times.
# Also, the table lists the planned end of DST in 1949, but the corresponding
# zone line cuts this off on May 28, when the Communists took power.

# From Phake Nick (2020-04-15):
#
# For the history of time in Shanghai between 1940-1942, the situation is
# actually slightly more complex than the table [below]....  At the time,
# there were three different authorities in Shanghai, including Shanghai
# International Settlement, a settlement established by western countries with
# its own westernized form of government, Shanghai French Concession, similar
# to the international settlement but is controlled by French, and then the
# rest of the city of Shanghai, which have already been controlled by Japanese
# force through a puppet local government (Wang Jingwei regime).  It was
# additionally complicated by the circumstances that, according to the 1940s
# Shanghai summer time essay cited in the database, some
# departments/businesses/people in the Shanghai city itself during that time
# period, refused to change their clock and instead only changed their opening
# hours.
#
# For example, as quoted in the article, in 1940, other than the authority
# itself, power, tram, bus companies, cinema, department stores, and other
# public service organizations have all decided to follow the summer time and
# spring forward the clock.  On the other hand, the custom office refused to
# spring forward the clock because of worry on mechanical wear to the physical
# clock, postal office refused to spring forward because of disruption to
# business and log-keeping, although they did changed their office hour to
# match rest of the city.  So is travel agents, and also weather
# observatory.  It is said both time standards had their own supporters in the
# city at the time, those who prefer new time standard would have moved their
# clock while those who prefer the old time standard would keep their clock
# unchange, and there were different clocks that use different time standard
# in the city at the time for people who use different time standard to adjust
# their clock to their preferred time.
#
# a. For the 1940 May 31 spring forward, the essay [says] ... "Hong
# Kong government implemented the spring forward in the same time on
# the same date as Shanghai".
#
# b. For the 1940 fall back, it was said that they initially intended to do
# so on September 30 00:59 at night, however they postponed it to October 12
# after discussion with relevant parties. However schools restored to the
# original schedule ten days earlier.
#
# c. For the 1941 spring forward, it is said to start from March 15
# "following the previous year's method", and in addition to that the essay
# cited an announcement in 1941 from the Wang regime which said the Special
# City of Shanghai under Wang regime control will follow the DST rule set by
# the Settlements, irrespective of the original DST plan announced by the Wang
# regime for other area under its control(April 1 to September 30). (no idea
# to situation before that announcement)
#
# d. For the 1941 fall back, it was said that the fall back would occurs at
# the end of September (A newspaper headline cited by the essay, published on
# October 1, 1941, have the headlines which said "French Concession would
# rewind to the old clock this morning), but it ultimately didn't happen due
# to disagreement between the international settlement authority and the
# French concession authority, and the fall back ultimately occurred on
# November 1.
#
# e. In 1941 December, Japan have officially started war with the United
# States and the United Kingdom, and in Shanghai they have marched into the
# international settlement, taken over its control
#
# f. For the 1942 spring forward, the essay said that the spring forward
# started on January 31. It said this time the custom office and postal
# department will also change their clocks, unlike before.
#
# g. The essay itself didn't cover any specific changes thereafter until the
# end of the war, it quoted a November 1942 command from the government of the
# Wang regime, which claim the daylight saving time applies year round during
# the war. However, the essay ambiguously said the period is "February 1 to
# September 30", which I don't really understand what is the meaning of such
# period in the context of year round implementation here.. More researches
# might be needed to show exactly what happened during that period of time.

# From Phake Nick (2020-04-15):
# According to a Japanese tour bus pamphlet in Nanjing area believed to be
# from around year 1941: http://www.tt-museum.jp/tairiku_0280_nan1941.html ,
# the schedule listed was in the format of Japanese time.  Which indicate some
# use of the Japanese time (instead of syncing by DST) might have occurred in
# the Yangtze river delta area during that period of time although the scope
# of such use will need to be investigated to determine.

# From Anthony Fok (2001-12-20):
# BTW, I did some research on-line and found some info regarding these five
# historic timezones from some Taiwan websites.  And yes, there are official
# Chinese names for these locales (before 1949).
#
# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2006-07-14):
# I have investigated the timezones around 1970 on the
# https://www.astro.com/atlas site [with provinces and county
# boundaries summarized below]....  A few other exceptions were two
# counties on the Sichuan side of the Xizang-Sichuan border,
# counties Dege and Baiyu which lies on the Sichuan side and are
# therefore supposed to be GMT+7, Xizang region being GMT+6, but Dege
# county is GMT+8 according to astro.com while Baiyu county is GMT+6
# (could be true), for the moment I am assuming that those two
# counties are mistakes in the astro.com data.

# From Paul Eggert (2017-01-05):
# Alois Treindl kindly sent me translations of the following two sources:
#
# (1)
# Guo Qing-sheng (National Time-Service Center, CAS, Xi'an 710600, China)
# Beijing Time at the Beginning of the PRC
# China Historical Materials of Science and Technology
# (Zhongguo ke ji shi liao, 中国科技史料). 2003;24(1):5-9.
# http://oversea.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?filename=ZGKS200301000&dbname=CJFD2003
# It gives evidence that at the beginning of the PRC, Beijing time was
# officially apparent solar time!  However, Guo also says that the
# evidence is dubious, as the relevant institute of astronomy had not
# been taken over by the PRC yet.  It's plausible that apparent solar
# time was announced but never implemented, and that people continued
# to use UT+8.  As the Shanghai radio station (and I presume the
# observatory) was still under control of French missionaries, it
# could well have ignored any such mandate.
#
# (2)
# Guo Qing-sheng (Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory, CAS, Xi'an 710600, China)
# A Study on the Standard Time Changes for the Past 100 Years in China
# [undated and unknown publication location]
# It says several things:
#   * The Qing dynasty used local apparent solar time throughout China.
#   * The Republic of China instituted Beijing mean solar time effective
#     the official calendar book of 1914.
#   * The French Concession in Shanghai set up signal stations in
#     French docks in the 1890s, controlled by Xujiahui (Zikawei)
#     Observatory and set to local mean time.
#   * "From the end of the 19th century" it changed to UT+8.
#   * Chinese Customs (by then reduced to a tool of foreign powers)
#     eventually standardized on this time for all ports, and it
#     became used by railways as well.
#   * In 1918 the Central Observatory proposed dividing China into
#     five time zones (see below for details).  This caught on
#     at first only in coastal areas observing UT+8.
#   * During WWII all of China was in theory was at UT+7.  In practice
#     this was ignored in the west, and I presume was ignored in
#     Japanese-occupied territory.
#   * Japanese-occupied Manchuria was at UT+9, i.e., Japan time.
#   * The five-zone plan was resurrected after WWII and officially put into
#     place (with some modifications) in March 1948.  It's not clear
#     how well it was observed in areas under Nationalist control.
#   * The People's Liberation Army used UT+8 during the civil war.
#
# An AP article "Shanghai Internat'l Area Little Changed" in the
# Lewiston (ME) Daily Sun (1939-05-29), p 17, said "Even the time is
# different - the occupied districts going by Tokyo time, an hour
# ahead of that prevailing in the rest of Shanghai."  Guess that the
# Xujiahui Observatory was under French control and stuck with UT +08.
#
# In earlier versions of this file, China had many separate Zone entries, but
# this was based on what were apparently incorrect data in Shanks & Pottenger.
# This has now been simplified to the two entries Asia/Shanghai and
# Asia/Urumqi, with the others being links for backward compatibility.
# Proposed in 1918 and theoretically in effect until 1949 (although in practice
# mainly observed in coastal areas), the five zones were:
#
# Changbai Time ("Long-white Time", Long-white = Heilongjiang area) UT +08:30
# Now part of Asia/Shanghai; its pre-1970 times are not recorded here.
# Heilongjiang (except Mohe county), Jilin
#
# Zhongyuan Time ("Central plain Time") UT +08
# Now part of Asia/Shanghai.
# most of China
# Milne gives 8:05:43.2 for Xujiahui Observatory time....
# Guo says Shanghai switched to UT +08 "from the end of the 19th century".
#
# Long-shu Time (probably as Long and Shu were two names of the area) UT +07
# Now part of Asia/Shanghai; its pre-1970 times are not recorded here.
# Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Ningxia, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Yunnan;
# most of Gansu; west Inner Mongolia; east Qinghai; and the Guangdong
# counties Deqing, Enping, Kaiping, Luoding, Taishan, Xinxing,
# Yangchun, Yangjiang, Yu'nan, and Yunfu.
#
# Xin-zang Time ("Xinjiang-Tibet Time") UT +06
# This region is now part of either Asia/Urumqi or Asia/Shanghai with
# current boundaries uncertain; times before 1970 for areas that
# disagree with Ürümqi or Shanghai are not recorded here.
# The Gansu counties Aksay, Anxi, Dunhuang, Subei; west Qinghai;
# the Guangdong counties  Xuwen, Haikang, Suixi, Lianjiang,
# Zhanjiang, Wuchuan, Huazhou, Gaozhou, Maoming, Dianbai, and Xinyi;
# east Tibet, including Lhasa, Chamdo, Shigaise, Jimsar, Shawan and Hutubi;
# east Xinjiang, including Ürümqi, Turpan, Karamay, Korla, Minfeng, Jinghe,
# Wusu, Qiemo, Xinyan, Wulanwusu, Jinghe, Yumin, Tacheng, Tuoli, Emin,
# Shihezi, Changji, Yanqi, Heshuo, Tuokexun, Tulufan, Shanshan, Hami,
# Fukang, Kuitun, Kumukuli, Miquan, Qitai, and Turfan.
#
# Kunlun Time UT +05:30
# This region is now in the same status as Xin-zang Time (see above).
# West Tibet, including Pulan, Aheqi, Shufu, Shule;
# West Xinjiang, including Aksu, Atushi, Yining, Hetian, Cele, Luopu, Nileke,
# Zhaosu, Tekesi, Gongliu, Chabuchaer, Huocheng, Bole, Pishan, Suiding,
# and Yarkand.

# From Luther Ma (2009-10-17):
# Almost all (>99.9%) ethnic Chinese (properly ethnic Han) living in
# Xinjiang use Chinese Standard Time. Some are aware of Xinjiang time,
# but have no need of it. All planes, trains, and schools function on
# what is called "Beijing time." When Han make an appointment in Chinese
# they implicitly use Beijing time.
#
# On the other hand, ethnic Uyghurs, who make up about half the
# population of Xinjiang, typically use "Xinjiang time" which is two
# hours behind Beijing time, or UT +06. The government of the Xinjiang
# Uyghur Autonomous Region, (XAUR, or just Xinjiang for short) as well as
# local governments such as the Ürümqi city government use both times in
# publications, referring to what is popularly called Xinjiang time as
# "Ürümqi time." When Uyghurs make an appointment in the Uyghur language
# they almost invariably use Xinjiang time.
#
# (Their ethnic Han compatriots would typically have no clue of its
# widespread use, however, because so extremely few of them are fluent in
# Uyghur, comparable to the number of Anglo-Americans fluent in Navajo.)
#
# (...As with the rest of China there was a brief interval ending in 1990
# or 1991 when summer time was in use.  The confusion was severe, with
# the province not having dual times but four times in use at the same
# time. Some areas remained on standard Xinjiang time or Beijing time and
# others moving their clocks ahead.)

# From Luther Ma (2009-11-19):
# With the risk of being redundant to previous answers these are the most common
# English "transliterations" (w/o using non-English symbols):
#
# 1. Wulumuqi...
# 2. Kashi...
# 3. Urumqi...
# 4. Kashgar...
# ...
# 5. It seems that Uyghurs in Ürümqi has been using Xinjiang since at least the
# 1960's. I know of one Han, now over 50, who grew up in the surrounding
# countryside and used Xinjiang time as a child.
#
# 6. Likewise for Kashgar and the rest of south Xinjiang I don't know of any
# start date for Xinjiang time.
#
# Without having access to local historical records, nor the ability to legally
# publish them, I would go with October 1, 1949, when Xinjiang became the Uyghur
# Autonomous Region under the PRC. (Before that Uyghurs, of course, would also
# not be using Beijing time, but some local time.)

# From David Cochrane (2014-03-26):
# Just a confirmation that Ürümqi time was implemented in Ürümqi on 1 Feb 1986:
# https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960684,00.html

# From Luther Ma (2014-04-22):
# I have interviewed numerous people of various nationalities and from
# different localities in Xinjiang and can confirm the information in Guo's
# report regarding Xinjiang, as well as the Time article reference by David
# Cochrane.  Whether officially recognized or not (and both are officially
# recognized), two separate times have been in use in Xinjiang since at least
# the Cultural Revolution: Xinjiang Time (XJT), aka Ürümqi Time or local time;
# and Beijing Time.  There is no confusion in Xinjiang as to which name refers
# to which time. Both are widely used in the province, although in some
# population groups might be use one to the exclusion of the other.  The only
# problem is that computers and smart phones list Ürümqi (or Kashgar) as
# having the same time as Beijing.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
# In the early days of the PRC, Tibet was given its own time zone (UT +06)
# but this was withdrawn in 1959 and never reinstated; see Tubten Khétsun,
# Memories of life in Lhasa under Chinese Rule, Columbia U Press, ISBN
# 978-0231142861 (2008), translator's introduction by Matthew Akester, p x.
# As this is before our 1970 cutoff, Tibet doesn't need a separate zone.
#
# Xinjiang Time is well-documented as being officially recognized.  E.g., see
# "The Working-Calendar for The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government"
# <http://www.sinkiang.gov.cn/service/ourworking/> (2014-04-22).
# Unfortunately, we have no good records of time in Xinjiang before 1986.
# During the 20th century parts of Xinjiang were ruled by the Qing dynasty,
# the Republic of China, various warlords, the First and Second East Turkestan
# Republics, the Soviet Union, the Kuomintang, and the People's Republic of
# China, and tracking down all these organizations' timekeeping rules would be
# quite a trick.  Approximate this lost history by a transition from LMT to
# UT +06 at the start of 1928, the year of accession of the warlord Jin Shuren,
# which happens to be the date given by Shanks & Pottenger (no doubt as a
# guess) as the transition from LMT.  Ignore the usage of +08 before
# 1986-02-01 under the theory that the transition date to +08 is unknown and
# that the sort of users who prefer Asia/Urumqi now typically ignored the
# +08 mandate back then.

# Kong. [According] to the DST record from Hong Kong Observatory (actually,
# it is not [an] observatory, but the official meteorological agency of HK,
# and also serves as the official timing agency), there are some missing

# From Joseph Myers (2018-11-18):

# ... the log of drop times in Table II shows that on Sunday 1904-10-30 the

# of broadcasting the new local time.
#
# From Phake Nick (2018-11-18):
# According to The Hong Kong Weekly Press, 1904-10-29, p.324, the

# From Phake Nick (2018-10-26):
# I went to check microfilm records stored at Hong Kong Public Library....
# on September 30 1941, according to Ta Kung Pao (Hong Kong edition), it was
# stated that fallback would occur on the next day (the 1st)'s "03:00 am (Hong
# Kong Time 04:00 am)" and the clock will fall back for a half hour. (03:00
# probably refer to the time commonly used in mainland China at the time given
# the paper's background) ... the sunrise/sunset time given by South China
# Morning Post for October 1st was indeed moved by half an hour compares to
# before.  After that, in December, the battle to capture Hong Kong started and
# the library doesn't seems to have any record stored about press during that
# period of time.  Some media resumed publication soon after that within the
# same month, but there were not much information about time there.  Later they
# started including a radio program guide when they restored radio service,
# explicitly mentioning it use Tokyo standard time, and later added a note
# saying it's half an hour ahead of the old Hong Kong standard time, and it
# also seems to indicate that Hong Kong was not using GMT+8 when it was
# captured by Japan.

# Taiwan

# From smallufo (2010-04-03):
# According to Taiwan's CWB [Central Weather Bureau],
# http://www.cwb.gov.tw/V6/astronomy/cdata/summert.htm
# Taipei has DST in 1979 between July 1st and Sep 30.

# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2013-07-12):
# On Dec 28, 1895, the Meiji Emperor announced Ordinance No. 167 of
# Meiji Year 28 "The clause about standard time", mentioned that
# Taiwan and Penghu Islands, as well as Yaeyama and Miyako Islands
# (both in Okinawa) adopt the Western Standard Time which is based on
# 120E. The adoption began from Jan 1, 1896. The original text can be
# found on Wikisource:
# https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/標準時ニ關スル件_(公布時)
# ... This could be the first adoption of time zone in Taiwan, because
# during the Qing Dynasty, it seems that there was no time zone
# declared officially.
#
# Later, in the beginning of World War II, on Sep 25, 1937, the Showa
# Emperor announced Ordinance No. 529 of Showa Year 12 "The clause of
# revision in the ordinance No. 167 of Meiji year 28 about standard
# time", in which abolished the adoption of Western Standard Time in
# western islands (listed above), which means the whole Japan
# territory, including later occupations, adopt Japan Central Time
# (UT+9). The adoption began on Oct 1, 1937. The original text can
# be found on Wikisource:

#
# That is, the time zone of Taipei switched to UT+9 on Oct 1, 1937.

# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):
# I've found more evidence about when the time zone was switched from UT+9
# back to UT+8 after WW2.  I believe it was on Sep 21, 1945.  In a document
# during Japanese era [1] in which the officer told the staff to change time
# zone back to Western Standard Time (UT+8) on Sep 21.  And in another
# history page of National Cheng Kung University [2], on Sep 21 there is a
# note "from today, switch back to Western Standard Time".  From these two
# materials, I believe that the time zone change happened on Sep 21.  And
# today I have found another monthly journal called "The Astronomical Herald"
# from The Astronomical Society of Japan [3] in which it mentioned the fact
# that:
#
# 1. Standard Time of the Country (Japan) was adopted on Jan 1, 1888, using
# the time at 135E (GMT+9)
#
# 2. Standard Time of the Country was renamed to Central Standard Time, on Jan
# 1, 1898, and on the same day, the new territories Taiwan and Penghu islands,
# as well as Yaeyama and Miyako islands, adopted a new time zone called
# Western Standard Time, which is in GMT+8.
#
# 3. Western Standard Time was deprecated on Sep 30, 1937. From then all the
# territories of Japan adopted the same time zone, which is Central Standard
# Time.

# Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-03):
# I finally have found the real official gazette about changing back to
# Western Standard Time on Sep 21 in Taiwan.  It's Taiwan Governor-General
# Bulletin No. 386 in Showa 20 years (1945), published on Sep 19, 1945. [1] ...
# [It] abolishes Bulletin No. 207 in Showa 12 years (1937), which is a local
# bulletin in Taiwan for that Ordinance No. 529. It also mentioned that 1am on
# Sep 21, 1945 will be 12am on Sep 21.  I think this bulletin is much more
# official than the one I mentioned in my first mail, because it's from the
# top-level government in Taiwan. If you're going to quote any resource, this
# would be a good one.
# [1] Taiwan Governor-General Gazette, No. 1018, Sep 19, 1945:

# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):
# In 1946, DST in Taiwan was from May 15 and ended on Sep 30. The info from
# Central Weather Bureau website was not correct.
#
# Original Bulletin:
# http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=03502F0AKM1AF
# http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=0350300AKM1B0 (cont.)
#
# In 1947, DST in Taiwan was expanded to Oct 31. There is a backup of that
# telegram announcement from Taiwan Province Government:
#
# http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=0360310AKZ431
#
# Here is a brief translation:
#
#   The Summer Time this year is adopted from midnight Apr 15 until Sep 20
#   midnight. To save (energy?) consumption, we're expanding Summer Time
#   adoption till Oct 31 midnight.
#
# The Central Weather Bureau website didn't mention that, however it can
# be found from historical government announcement database.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-03):
# As per Yu-Cheng Chuang, say that Taiwan was at UT +09 from 1937-10-01
# until 1945-09-21 at 01:00, overriding Shanks & Pottenger.
# Likewise, use Yu-Cheng Chuang's data for DST in Taiwan.

# Macau (Macao, Aomen)
#
# From P Chan (2018-05-10):
# * LegisMac
#   http://legismac.safp.gov.mo/legismac/descqry/Descqry.jsf?lang=pt
#   A database for searching titles of legal documents of Macau in
#   Chinese and Portuguese.  The term "HORÁRIO DE VERÃO" can be used for
#   searching decrees about summer time.
# * Archives of Macao
#   http://www.archives.gov.mo/en/bo/
#   It contains images of old official gazettes.
# * The Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau have a page listing the
#   summer time history.  But it is not complete and has some mistakes.
#   http://www.smg.gov.mo/smg/geophysics/e_t_Summer%20Time.htm
# Macau adopted GMT+8 on 30 Oct 1904 to follow Hong Kong.  Clocks were
# advanced by 25 minutes and 50 seconds.  Which means the LMT used was
# +7:34:10.  As stated in the "Portaria No. 204" dated 21 October 1904
# and published in the Official Gazette on 29 October 1904.

# Georgia
# From Paul Eggert (1994-11-19):
# Today's _Economist_ (p 60) reports that Georgia moved its clocks forward
# an hour recently, due to a law proposed by Zurab Murvanidze,
# an MP who went on a hunger strike for 11 days to force discussion about it!
# We have no details, but we'll guess they didn't move the clocks back in fall.
#
# From Mathew Englander, quoting AP (1996-10-23 13:05-04):
# Instead of putting back clocks at the end of October, Georgia
# will stay on daylight savings time this winter to save energy,
# President Eduard Shevardnadze decreed Wednesday.
#
# From the BBC via Joseph S. Myers (2004-06-27):
#
# Georgia moved closer to Western Europe on Sunday...  The former Soviet
# republic has changed its time zone back to that of Moscow.  As a result it
# is now just four hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time, rather than five hours
# ahead.  The switch was decreed by the pro-Western president of Georgia,
# Mikheil Saakashvili, who said the change was partly prompted by the process
# of integration into Europe.

# From Teimuraz Abashidze (2005-11-07):
# Government of Georgia ... decided to NOT CHANGE daylight savings time on
# [Oct.] 30, as it was done before during last more than 10 years.
# Currently, we are in fact GMT +4:00, as before 30 October it was GMT
# +3:00.... The problem is, there is NO FORMAL LAW or governmental document
# about it.  As far as I can find, I was told, that there is no document,
# because we just DIDN'T ISSUE document about switching to winter time....
# I don't know what can be done, especially knowing that some years ago our
# DST rules where changed THREE TIMES during one month.

# Milne 1899 says Tbilisi (Tiflis) time was 2:59:05.7.
# Byalokoz 1919 says Georgia was 2:59:11.

# East Timor

# From Tim Parenti (2024-07-01):
# The 1912-01-01 transition occurred at 00:00 new time, per the 1911-05-24
# Portuguese decree (see Europe/Lisbon).  A provision in article 5(c) of the
# decree prescribed that Timor "will keep counting time in harmony with
# neighboring foreign colonies, [for] as long as they do not adopt the time
# that belongs to them in [the Washington Convention] system."

# See Indonesia for the 1945 transition.

# From João Carrascalão, brother of the former governor of East Timor, in
# East Timor may be late for its millennium
# <https://etan.org/et99c/december/26-31/30ETMAY.htm> (1999-12-26/31):
# Portugal tried to change the time forward in 1974 because the sun
# rises too early but the suggestion raised a lot of problems with the
# Timorese and I still don't think it would work today because it
# conflicts with their way of life.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-12-04):
# We don't have any record of the above attempt.
# Most likely our records are incomplete, but we have no better data.

# From Manoel de Almeida e Silva, Deputy Spokesman for the UN Secretary-General
# http://www.hri.org/news/world/undh/2000/00-08-16.undh.html
# (2000-08-16):
# The Cabinet of the East Timor Transition Administration decided
# today to advance East Timor's time by one hour.  The time change,
# which will be permanent, with no seasonal adjustment, will happen at
# midnight on Saturday, September 16.

# India

# British astronomer Henry Park Hollis disliked India Standard Time's offset:
# "A new time system has been proposed for India, Further India, and Burmah.
# The scheme suggested is that the times of the meridians 5½ and 6½ hours
# east of Greenwich should be adopted in these territories.  No reason is
# given why hourly meridians five hours and six hours east should not be
# chosen; a plan which would bring the time of India into harmony with
# that of almost the whole of the civilised world."

# (2015-12-22):
# In January 1906, several thousand cotton-mill workers rioted on the
# outskirts of Bombay....  They were protesting the proposed abolition of
# local time in favor of Indian Standard Time....  Journalists called this
# dispute the "Battle of the Clocks."  It lasted nearly half a century.

# From Paul Eggert (2017-04-20):
# Good luck trying to nail down old timekeeping records in India.
# "... in the nineteenth century ... Madras Observatory took its magnetic
# measurements on Göttingen time, its meteorological measurements on Madras
# (local) time, dropped its time ball on Greenwich (ocean navigator's) time,
# and distributed civil (local time)." -- Bartky IR. Selling the true time:
# 19th-century timekeeping in america. Stanford U Press (2000), 247 note 19.
# "A more potent cause of resistance to the general adoption of the present
# standard time lies in the fact that it is Madras time.  The citizen of
# Bombay, proud of being 'primus in Indis' and of Calcutta, equally proud of
# his city being the Capital of India, and - for a part of the year - the Seat
# of the Supreme Government, alike look down on Madras, and refuse to change
# the time they are using, for that of what they regard as a benighted
# Presidency; while Madras, having for long given the standard time to the
# rest of India, would resist the adoption of any other Indian standard in its
# place." -- Oldham RD. On Time in India: a suggestion for its improvement.
# Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (April 1899), 49-55.
#
# "In 1870 ... Madras time - 'now used by the telegraph and regulated from the
# only government observatory' - was suggested as a standard railway time,
# first to be adopted on the Great Indian Peninsular Railway (GIPR)....
# Calcutta, Bombay, and Karachi, were to be allowed to continue with their
# local time for civil purposes." - Prasad R. Tracks of Change: Railways and
# Everyday Life in Colonial India. Cambridge University Press (2016), 145.

# This lists +052110 as Madras local time used in railways, and says that on
# 1906-01-01 railways and telegraphs in India switched to +0530.  Some
# municipalities retained their former time, and the time in Calcutta
# continued to depend on whether you were at the railway station or at
# government offices.  Government time was at +055320 (according to Shanks) or
# at +0554 (according to the Indian Year Book).  Railway time is more
# appropriate for our purposes, as it was better documented, it is what we do
# elsewhere (e.g., Europe/London before 1880), and after 1906 it was
# consistent in the region now identified by Asia/Kolkata.  So, use railway
# time for 1870-1941.  Shanks is our only (and dubious) source for the
# 1941-1945 data.

# Iran

# From Roozbeh Pournader (2022-05-30):
# Here's an order from the Cabinet to the rest of the government to switch to
# Tehran time, which is mentioned to be already at +03:30:
# https://qavanin.ir/Law/TreeText/180138
# Just in case that goes away, I also saved a copy at archive.org:
# https://web.archive.org/web/20220530111940/https://qavanin.ir/Law/TreeText/180138
# Here's my translation:
#
# "Circular on Matching the Hours of Governmental and Official Circles
# in Provinces
# Approved 1314/03/22 [=1935-06-13]
# According to the ruling of the Honorable Cabinet, it is ordered that from
# now on in all internal provinces of the country, governmental and official
# circles set their time to match Tehran time (three hours and half before
# Greenwich)....
#
# I still haven't found out when Tehran itself switched to +03:30....
#
# From Paul Eggert (2022-06-05):
# Although the above says Tehran was at +03:30 before 1935-06-13, we don't
# know when it switched to +03:30.  For now, use 1935-06-13 as the switch date.
# Although most likely wrong, we have no better info.

# From Roozbeh Pournader (2022-06-01):
# This is from Kayhan newspaper, one of the major Iranian newspapers, from
# March 20, 1978, page 2:
#
# "Pull the clocks 60 minutes forward
# As we informed before, from the fourth day of the month Farvardin of the
# new year [=1978-03-24], clocks will be pulled forward, and people's daily
# work and life program will start one hour earlier than the current program.
# On the 1st day of the month Farvardin of this year [=1977-03-21], they had
# pulled the clocks forward by one hour, but in the month of Mehr
# [=1977-09-23], the clocks were pulled back by 30 minutes.
# In this way, from the 4th day of the month Farvardin, clocks will be ahead
# of the previous years by one hour and a half.
# According to the new program, during the night of 4th of Farvardin, when
# the midnight, meaning 24 o'clock is announced, the hands of the clock must
# be pulled forward by one hour and thus consider midnight 1 o'clock in the
# forenoon."
#
# This implies that in September 1977, when the daylight savings time was
# done with, Iran didn't go back to +03:30, but immediately to +04:00.
#
#
# This is from the major Iranian newspaper Ettela'at, dated [1978-08-03]...,
# page 32. It looks like they decided to get the clocks back to +4:00
# just in time for Ramadan that year:
#
# "Tomorrow Night, Pull the Clocks Back by One Hour
# At 1 o'clock in the forenoon of Saturday 14 Mordad [=1978-08-05], the
# clocks will be pulled one hour back and instead of 1 o'clock in the
# forenoon, Radio Iran will announce 24 o'clock.
# This decision was made in the Cabinet of Ministers meeting of 25 Tir
# [=1978-07-16], [...]
# At the beginning of the year 2537 [=March 1978: Iran was using a different
# year number for a few years then, based on the Coronation of Cyrus the
# Great], the country's official time was pulled forward by one hour and now
# the official time is one hour and a half ahead compared to last year,
# because in Farvardin of last year [=March 1977], the official time was
# pulled forward one hour and this continued until the second half of last
# year [=September 1977] until in the second half of last year the official
# time was pulled back half an hour and that half hour still remains."
#
# This matches the time of the true noon published in the newspapers, as they
# clearly go from +05:00 to +04:00 after that date (which happened during a
# long weekend in Iran).

# From Roozbeh Pournader (2022-05-31):
# [Movahedi S. Cultural preconceptions of time: Can we use operational time
# to meddle in God's Time? Comp Stud Soc Hist. 1985;27(3):385-400]
# https://www.jstor.org/stable/178704
# Here's the quotes from the paper:
# 1. '"Iran's official time keeper moved the clock one hour forward as from
# March 22, 1977 (Farvardin 2, 2536) to make maximum use of daylight and save
# in energy consumption. Thus Iran joined such other countries as Britain in
# observing what is known as 'daylight saving.' The proposal was originally
# put forward by the Ministry of Energy, in no way having any influence on
# observing religious ceremonies. Moving time one hour forward in summer
# means that at 11:00 o'clock on March 21, the official time was set as
# midnight March 22. Then September 24 will actually begin one hour later
# than the end of September 23 [...]." Iran's time base thus continued to be
# Greenwich Mean Time plus three and one-half hours (plus four and one-half
# hours in summer).'
#
# The article sources this from Iran Almanac and Book of Facts, 1977, Tehran:
# Echo of Iran, which is on Google Books at
# https://www.google.com/books/edition/Iran_Almanac_and_Book_of_Facts/9ybVAAAAMAAJ.
# (I confirmed it by searching for snippets.)
#
# 2. "After the fall of the shah, the revolutionary government returned to
# daylight-saving time (DST) on 26 May 1979."
#
# This seems to have been announced just one day in advance, on 25 May 1979.
#
# The change in 1977 clearly seems to be the first daylight savings effort in
# Iran. But the article doesn't mention what happened in 1978 (which was
# still during the shah's government), or how things continued in 1979
# onwards (which was during the Islamic Republic).

# From Francis Santoni (2022-06-01):
# for Iran and 1977 the effective change is only 20 October
# (UIT No. 143 17.XI.1977) and not 23 September (UIT No. 141 13.IX.1977).
# UIT is the Operational Bulletin of International Telecommunication Union.

# From Roozbeh Pournader (2025-03-18):
# ... the exact time of Iran's transition from +0400 to +0330 ... was Friday
# 1357/8/19 AP=1978-11-10. Here's a newspaper clip from the Ettela'at
# newspaper, dated 1357/8/14 AP=1978-11-05, translated from Persian
# (at https://w.wiki/DUEY):
#	Following the government's decision about returning the official time
#	to the previous status, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Energy
#	announced today: At the hour 24 of Friday 19th of Aban (=1978-11-10),
#	the country's time will be pulled back half an hour.
#
# From Roozbeh Pournader (2003-03-15):
# This is an English translation of what I just found (originally in Persian).
# The Gregorian dates in brackets are mine:
#
#	Official Newspaper No. 13548-1370/6/25 [1991-09-16]
#	No. 16760/T233 H				1370/6/10 [1991-09-01]
#
#	The Rule About Change of the Official Time of the Country
#
#	The Board of Ministers, in the meeting dated 1370/5/23 [1991-08-14],
#	based on the suggestion number 2221/D dated 1370/4/22 [1991-07-13]
#	of the Country's Organization for Official and Employment Affairs,
#	and referring to the law for equating the working hours of workers
#	and officers in the whole country dated 1359/4/23 [1980-07-14], and
#	for synchronizing the official times of the country, agreed that:
#
#	The official time of the country will should move forward one hour
#	at the 24[:00] hours of the first day of Farvardin and should return
#	to its previous state at the 24[:00] hours of the 30th day of
#	Shahrivar.
#
#	First Deputy to the President - Hassan Habibi
#
# From personal experience, that agrees with what has been followed
# for at least the last 5 years.  Before that, for a few years, the
# date used was the first Thursday night of Farvardin and the last
# Thursday night of Shahrivar, but I can't give exact dates....
#
# From Roozbeh Pournader (2005-04-05):
# The text of the Iranian law, in effect since 1925, clearly mentions
# that the true solar year is the measure, and there is no arithmetic
# leap year calculation involved.  There has never been any serious
# plan to change that law....
#
# From Paul Eggert (2022-06-30):
# Go with Pournader for 1935 through spring 1979, and for timestamps
# after August 1991; go with with Shanks & Pottenger for other timestamps.
# Go with Santoni's citation of the UIT for fall 1977, as 20 October 1977
# is 28 Mehr 1356, consistent with the "Mehr" in Pournader's source.
# Assume that the UIT's "1930" is UTC, i.e., 24:00 local time.
#
# From Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-03-30), writing about future
# discrepancies between cal-persia and the Iranian calendar:
# For 2091 solar-longitude-after yields 2091-03-20 08:40:07.7 UT for
# the vernal equinox and that gets so close to 12:00 some local
# Iranian time that the definition of the correct location needs to be
# known exactly, amongst other factors.  2157 is even closer:
# 2157-03-20 08:37:15.5 UT.  But the Gregorian year 2025 should give
# no interpretation problem whatsoever.  By the way, another instant
# in the near future where there will be a discrepancy between
# arithmetical and astronomical Iranian calendars will be in 2058:
# vernal equinox on 2058-03-20 09:03:05.9 UT.  The Java version of
# Reingold's/Dershowitz' calculator gives correctly the Gregorian date
# 2058-03-21 for 1 Farvardin 1437 (astronomical).
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-03-22):
# Several of my users have reported that Iran will not observe DST anymore:
# http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-17/0603193812164948.htm
#
# From Reuters (2007-09-16), with a heads-up from Jesper Nørgaard Welen:
# ... the Guardian Council ... approved a law on Sunday to re-introduce
# daylight saving time ...
# https://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKBLA65048420070916
#
# From Roozbeh Pournader (2007-11-05):
# This is quoted from Official Gazette of the Islamic Republic of
# Iran, Volume 63, No. 18242, dated Tuesday 1386/6/24
# [2007-10-16]. I am doing the best translation I can:...
# The official time of the country will be moved forward for one hour
# on the 24 hours of the first day of the month of Farvardin and will
# be changed back to its previous state on the 24 hours of the
# thirtieth day of Shahrivar.

# Iraq
#
# From Jonathan Lennox (2000-06-12):
# An article in this week's Economist ("Inside the Saddam-free zone", p. 50 in
# the U.S. edition) on the Iraqi Kurds contains a paragraph:
# "The three northern provinces ... switched their clocks this spring and
# are an hour ahead of Baghdad."
#
# But Rives McDow (2000-06-18) quotes a contact in Iraqi-Kurdistan as follows:
# In the past, some Kurdish nationalists, as a protest to the Iraqi
# Government, did not adhere to daylight saving time.  They referred
# to daylight saving as Saddam time.  But, as of today, the time zone
# in Iraqi-Kurdistan is on standard time with Baghdad, Iraq.
#
# So we'll ignore the Economist's claim.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-03-10):
# The cabinet in Iraq abolished DST last week, according to the following
# news sources (in Arabic):

# From Ephraim Silverberg (2001-01-11):
#
# I coined "IST/IDT" circa 1988.  Until then there were three
# different abbreviations in use:
#
# JST  Jerusalem Standard Time [Danny Braniss, Hebrew University]
# IZT  Israel Zonal (sic) Time [Prof. Haim Papo, Technion]
# EEST Eastern Europe Standard Time [used by almost everyone else]
#
# Since timezones should be called by country and not capital cities,
# I ruled out JST.  As Israel is in Asia Minor and not Eastern Europe,
# EEST was equally unacceptable.  Since "zonal" was not compatible with
# any other timezone abbreviation, I felt that 'IST' was the way to go
# and, indeed, it has received almost universal acceptance in timezone
# settings in Israeli computers.
#
# In any case, I am happy to share timezone abbreviations with India,
# high on my favorite-country list (and not only because my wife's
# family is from India).

# Several of the midnight transitions mentioned above are ambiguous;
# are they 00:00, 00:00s, 24:00, or 24:00s?  When resolving these ambiguities,
# try to minimize changes from previous tzdb versions, for lack of better info.
# Commentary from previous versions is included below, to help explain this.

# From Ephraim Silverberg
# (1997-03-04, 1998-03-16, 1998-12-28, 2000-01-17, 2000-07-25, 2004-12-22,
# and 2005-02-17):

# According to the Office of the Secretary General of the Ministry of
# Interior, there is NO set rule for Daylight-Savings/Standard time changes.
# One thing is entrenched in law, however: that there must be at least 150
# days of daylight savings time annually.  From 1993-1998, the change to
# daylight savings time was on a Friday morning from midnight IST to
# 1 a.m IDT; up until 1998, the change back to standard time was on a
# Saturday night from midnight daylight savings time to 11 p.m. standard
# time.  1996 is an exception to this rule where the change back to standard
# time took place on Sunday night instead of Saturday night to avoid
# conflicts with the Jewish New Year.  In 1999, the change to
# daylight savings time was still on a Friday morning but from
# 2 a.m. IST to 3 a.m. IDT; furthermore, the change back to standard time
# was also on a Friday morning from 2 a.m. IDT to 1 a.m. IST for
# 1999 only.  In the year 2000, the change to daylight savings time was
# similar to 1999, but although the change back will be on a Friday, it
# will take place from 1 a.m. IDT to midnight IST.  Starting in 2001, all
# changes to/from will take place at 1 a.m. old time, but now there is no
# rule as to what day of the week it will take place in as the start date
# (except in 2003) is the night after the Passover Seder (i.e. the eve
# of the 16th of Nisan in the lunar Hebrew calendar) and the end date
# (except in 2002) is three nights before Yom Kippur [Day of Atonement]
# (the eve of the 7th of Tishrei in the lunar Hebrew calendar).

# Japan

# '9:00' and 'JST' is from Guy Harris.

# From Paul Eggert (2020-01-19):
# Starting in the 7th century, Japan generally followed an ancient Chinese
# timekeeping system that divided night and day into six hours each,
# with hour length depending on season.  In 1873 the government
# started requiring the use of a Western style 24-hour clock.  See:
# Yulia Frumer, "Making Time: Astronomical Time Measurement in Tokugawa Japan"
# <https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1043907065>.  As the tzdb code and
# data support only 24-hour clocks, its tables model timestamps before
# 1873 using Western-style local mean time.

# From Hideyuki Suzuki (1998-11-09):
# 'Tokyo' usually stands for the former location of Tokyo Astronomical
# Observatory: 139° 44' 40.90" E (9h 18m 58.727s), 35° 39' 16.0" N.
# This data is from 'Rika Nenpyou (Chronological Scientific Tables) 1996'
# edited by National Astronomical Observatory of Japan....
# JST (Japan Standard Time) has been used since 1888-01-01 00:00 (JST).
# The law is enacted on 1886-07-07.

# From Hideyuki Suzuki (1998-11-16):
# The ordinance No. 51 (1886) established "standard time" in Japan,
# which stands for the time on 135° E.
# In the ordinance No. 167 (1895), "standard time" was renamed to "central
# standard time".  And the same ordinance also established "western standard
# time", which stands for the time on 120° E....  But "western standard
# time" was abolished in the ordinance No. 529 (1937).  In the ordinance No.
# 167, there is no mention regarding for what place western standard time is
# standard....
#
# I wrote "ordinance" above, but I don't know how to translate.
# In Japanese it's "chokurei", which means ordinance from emperor.

# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2013-07-12):
# ...the Meiji Emperor announced Ordinance No. 167 of Meiji Year 28 "The clause
# about standard time" ... The adoption began from Jan 1, 1896.
# https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/標準時ニ關スル件_(公布時)
#
# ...the Showa Emperor announced Ordinance No. 529 of Showa Year 12 ... which
# means the whole Japan territory, including later occupations, adopt Japan
# Central Time (UT+9). The adoption began on Oct 1, 1937.
# https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/明治二十八年勅令第百六十七號標準時ニ關スル件中改正ノ件

# From Paul Eggert (1995-03-06):
# Today's _Asahi Evening News_ (page 4) reports that Japan had
# daylight saving between 1948 and 1951, but "the system was discontinued
# because the public believed it would lead to longer working hours."

# From Mayumi Negishi in the 2005-08-10 Japan Times:
# http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20050810f2.htm
# Occupation authorities imposed daylight-saving time on Japan on
# [1948-05-01]....  But lack of prior debate and the execution of
# daylight-saving time just three days after the bill was passed generated
# deep hatred of the concept....  The Diet unceremoniously passed a bill to
# dump the unpopular system in October 1951, less than a month after the San
# Francisco Peace Treaty was signed.  (A government poll in 1951 showed 53%
# of the Japanese wanted to scrap daylight-saving time, as opposed to 30% who
# wanted to keep it.)

# From Takayuki Nikai (2018-01-19):
# The source of information is Japanese law.
# http://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/itdb_housei.nsf/html/houritsu/00219480428029.htm
# http://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/itdb_housei.nsf/html/houritsu/00719500331039.htm
# ... In summary, it is written as follows.  From 24:00 on the first Saturday
# in May, until 0:00 on the day after the second Saturday in September.

# From Phake Nick (2018-09-27):
# [T]he webpage authored by National Astronomical Observatory of Japan
# https://eco.mtk.nao.ac.jp/koyomi/wiki/BBFEB9EF2FB2C6BBFEB9EF.html
# ... mentioned that using Showa 23 (year 1948) as example, 13pm of September
# 11 in summer time will equal to 0am of September 12 in standard time.
# It cited a document issued by the Liaison Office which briefly existed
# during the postwar period of Japan, where the detail on implementation
# of the summer time is described in the document.
# https://eco.mtk.nao.ac.jp/koyomi/wiki/BBFEB9EF2FB2C6BBFEB9EFB2C6BBFEB9EFA4CEBCC2BBDCA4CBA4C4A4A4A4C6.pdf
# The text in the document do instruct a fall back to occur at
# September 11, 13pm in summer time, while ordinary citizens can
# change the clock before they sleep.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-09-27):
# This instruction is equivalent to "Sat>=8 25:00", so use that.  zic treats
# it like "Sun>=9 01:00", which is not quite the same but is the best we can
# do in any POSIX or C platform.  The "25:00" assumes zic from 2007 or later,
# which should be safe now.

#
# From <http://star.arabia.com/990930/JO9.html>

# Winter time starts today Thursday, 30 September. Clocks will be turned back

# (and they will use DST again next year, using the normal schedule).

# From Paul Eggert (2013-12-11):
# As Steffen suggested, consider the past 21-month experiment to be DST.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2021-09-24):

# Kazakhstan

# From Kazakhstan Embassy's News Bulletin No. 11
# <http://www.kazsociety.org.uk/news/2005/03/30.htm> (2005-03-21):
# The Government of Kazakhstan passed a resolution March 15 abolishing
# daylight saving time citing lack of economic benefits and health
# complications coupled with a decrease in productivity.
#
# From Branislav Kojic (in Astana) via Gwillim Law (2005-06-28):
# ... what happened was that the former Kazakhstan Eastern time zone
# was "blended" with the Central zone.  Therefore, Kazakhstan now has
# two time zones, and difference between them is one hour.  The zone
# closer to UTC is the former Western zone (probably still called the
# same), encompassing four provinces in the west: Aqtöbe, Atyraū,
# Mangghystaū, and West Kazakhstan.  The other zone encompasses
# everything else....  I guess that would make Kazakhstan time zones
# de jure UTC+5 and UTC+6 respectively.

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-27):
# Review of the linked documents from http://adilet.zan.kz/
# produced the following data for post-1991 Kazakhstan:
#
# 0. Act of the Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR
# from 1991-02-04 No. 20
# http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&nd=102010545
# removed the extra hour ("decree time") on the territory of the USSR
# starting with the last Sunday of March 1991.
# It also allowed (but not mandated) Kazakh SSR, Kirghiz SSR, Tajik SSR,
# Turkmen SSR and Uzbek SSR to not have "summer" time.
#
# The 1992-01-13 act also refers to the act of the Cabinet of Ministers
# of the Kazakh SSR from 1991-03-20 No. 170 "About the act of the Cabinet
# of Ministers of the USSR from 1991-02-04 No. 20" but I didn't found its
# text.
#
# According to Izvestia newspaper No. 68 (23334) from 1991-03-20
# -- page 6; available at http://libinfo.org/newsr/newsr2574.djvu via
# http://libinfo.org/index.php?id=58564 -- on 1991-03-31 at 2:00 during
# transition to "summer" time:
# Republic of Georgia, Latvian SSR, Lithuanian SSR, SSR Moldova,
# Estonian SSR; Komi ASSR; Kaliningrad oblast; Nenets autonomous okrug
# were to move clocks 1 hour forward.
# Kazakh SSR (excluding Uralsk oblast); Republic of Kyrgyzstan, Tajik
# SSR; Andijan, Jizzakh, Namangan, Sirdarya, Tashkent, Fergana oblasts
# of the Uzbek SSR were to move clocks 1 hour backwards.
# Other territories were to not move clocks.
# When the "summer" time would end on 1991-09-29, clocks were to be
# moved 1 hour backwards on the territory of the USSR excluding
# Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Tajikistan.
#
# Apparently there were last minute changes. Apparently Kazakh act No. 170
# was one of such changes.
#
# https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Декретное_время
# claims that Sovetskaya Rossiya newspaper on 1991-03-29 published that
# Nenets autonomous okrug, Komi and Kazakhstan (excluding Uralsk oblast)
# were to not move clocks and Uralsk oblast was to move clocks
# forward; on 1991-09-29 Kazakhstan was to move clocks backwards.
# (Probably there were changes even after that publication. There is an
# article claiming that Kaliningrad oblast decided on 1991-03-29 to not
# move clocks.)
#
# This implies that on 1991-03-31 Asia/Oral remained on +04/+05 while
# the rest of Kazakhstan switched from +06/+07 to +05/06 or from +05/06
# to +04/+05. It's unclear how Qyzylorda oblast moved into the fifth
# time belt. (By switching from +04/+05 to +05/+06 on 1991-09-29?) ...
#
# 1. Act of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1992-01-13 No. 28
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P920000028_
# (text includes modification from the 1996 act)
# introduced new rules for calculation of time, mirroring Russian
# 1992-01-08 act.  It specified that time would be calculated
# according to time belts plus extra hour ("decree time"), moved clocks
# on the whole territory of Kazakhstan 1 hour forward on 1992-01-19 at
# 2:00, specified DST rules.  It acknowledged that Kazakhstan was
# located in the fourth and the fifth time belts and specified the
# border between them to be located east of Qostanay and Aktyubinsk
# oblasts (notably including Turgai and Qyzylorda oblasts into the fifth
# time belt).
#

# 2. Act of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1992-03-27 No. 284
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P920000284_
# cancels extra hour ("decree time") for Uralsk and Qyzylorda oblasts
# since the last Sunday of March 1992, while keeping them in the fourth

#
# 3. Order of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1994-09-23 No. 384
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/R940000384_
# cancels the extra hour ("decree time") on the territory of Mangghystaū
# oblast since the last Sunday of September 1994 (saying that time on
# the territory would correspond to the third time belt as a
# result)....
#
# 4. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1996-05-08 No. 575
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P960000575_
# amends the 1992-01-13 act to end summer time in October instead

#
# 5. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 1999-03-26 No. 305
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P990000305_
# cancels the extra hour ("decree time") for Atyraū oblast since the
# last Sunday of March 1999 while retaining the oblast in the fourth
# time belt.
#
# This means change from +05/+06 to +04/+05....
#
# 6. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2000-11-23 No. 1749
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/archive/docs/P000001749_/23.11.2000
# replaces the previous five documents.
#
# The only changes I noticed are in definition of the border between the
# fourth and the fifth time belts.  They account for changes in spelling
# and administrative division (splitting of Turgai oblast in 1997
# probably changed time in territories incorporated into Qostanay oblast
# (including Arkalyk) from +06/+07 to +05/+06) and move Qyzylorda oblast
# from being in the fifth time belt and not using decree time into the
# fourth time belt (no change in practice).
#
# 7. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2003-12-29 No. 1342
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P030001342_
# modified the 2000-11-23 act.  No relevant changes, apparently.
#
# 8. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2004-07-20 No. 775
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/archive/docs/P040000775_/20.07.2004
# modified the 2000-11-23 act to move Qostanay and Qyzylorda oblasts into
# the fifth time belt and add Aktobe oblast to the list of regions not
# using extra hour ("decree time"), leaving Kazakhstan with only 2 time
# zones (+04/+05 and +06/+07).  The changes were to be implemented
# during DST transitions in 2004 and 2005 but the acts got radically
# amended before implementation happened.
#
# 9. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2004-09-15 No. 1059
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P040001059_
# modified the 2000-11-23 act to remove exceptions from the "decree time"
# (leaving Kazakhstan in +05/+06 and +06/+07 zones), amended the
# 2004-07-20 act to implement changes for Atyraū, West Kazakhstan,
# Qostanay, Qyzylorda and Mangghystaū oblasts by not moving clocks
# during the 2004 transition to "winter" time.
#
# This means transition from +04/+05 to +05/+06 for Atyraū oblast (no
# zone currently), Asia/Oral, Asia/Aqtau and transition from +05/+06 to
# +06/+07 for Qostanay oblast (Qostanay and Arkalyk, no zones currently)
# and Asia/Qyzylorda on 2004-10-31 at 3:00....
#
# 10. Act of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan
# from 2005-03-15 No. 231
# http://adilet.zan.kz/rus/docs/P050000231_
# removes DST provisions from the 2000-11-23 act, removes most of the
# (already implemented) provisions from the 2004-07-20 and 2004-09-15
# acts, comes into effect 10 days after official publication.
# The only practical effect seems to be the abolition of the summer
# time.
#
# Unamended version of the act of the Government of the Russian Federation
# No. 23 from 1992-01-08 [See 'europe' file for details].
# Kazakh 1992-01-13 act appears to provide the same rules and 1992-03-27
# act was to be enacted on the last Sunday of March 1992.

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-11-08):
# Turgai reorganization should affect only southern part of Qostanay
# oblast.  Which should probably be separated into Asia/Arkalyk zone.
# (There were also 1970, 1988 and 1990 Turgai oblast reorganizations
# according to wikipedia.)
#
# [For Qostanay] http://www.ng.kz/gazeta/195/hranit/
# suggests that clocks were to be moved 40 minutes backwards on
# 1920-01-01 to the fourth time belt.  But I do not understand
# how that could happen....
#
# [For Atyrau and Oral] 1919 decree
# (http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_russia-1919-02-08.html
# and in Byalokoz) lists Ural river (plus 10 versts on its left bank) in
# the third time belt (before 1930 this means +03).

# DST in Republic of Korea was as follows....  And I checked old

#
# 1908: Official Journal Article No. 3994 (decree No. 5)
# 1912: Governor-General of Korea Official Gazette Issue No. 367
#       (Announcement No. 338)
# 1954: Presidential Decree No. 876 (1954-03-17)
# 1961: Law No. 676 (1961-08-07)
#
# (Another source "1987: Law No. 3919 (1986-12-31)" was in the 2014-10-30

#
# I guessed that time zone abbreviations through 1945 followed the same
# rules as discussed under Taiwan, with nominal switches from JST to KST
# when the respective cities were taken over by the Allies after WWII.
#
# For Pyongyang, guess no changes from World War II until 2015, as we

# From Steffen Thorsen (2015-08-07):
# According to many news sources, North Korea is going to change to

# There is no common English-language abbreviation for this time zone.
# Use KST, as that's what we already use for 1954-1961 in ROK.

# Lebanon
#
# From Saadallah Itani (2023-03-23):
# Lebanon ... announced today delay of Spring forward from March 25 to April 20.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2023-03-27):
# This announcement was by the Lebanese caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati.
# https://www.mtv.com.lb/en/News/Local/1352516/lebanon-postpones-daylight-saving-time-adoption
# A video was later leaked to the media of parliament speaker Nabih Berri
# asking Mikati to postpone DST to aid observance of Ramadan, Mikati objecting
# that this would cause problems such as scheduling airline flights, to which
# Berri interjected, "What flights?"
#
# The change was controversial and led to a partly-sectarian divide.
# Many Lebanese institutions, including the education ministry, the Maronite
# church, and two news channels LCBI and MTV, ignored the announcement and
# went ahead with the long-scheduled spring-forward on March 25/26, some
# arguing that the prime minister had not followed the law because the change
# had not been approved by the cabinet.  Google went with the announcement;
# Apple ignored it.  At least one bank followed the announcement for its doors,
# but ignored the announcement in internal computer systems.
# Beirut international airport listed two times for each departure.
# Dan Azzi wrote "My view is that this whole thing is a Dumb and Dumber movie."
# Eventually the prime minister backed down, said the cabinet had decided to
# stick with its 1998 decision, and that DST would begin midnight March 29/30.

# Although we could model the chaos with two Zones, that would likely cause
# more trouble than it would cure.  Since so many manual clocks and
# computer-based timestamps ignored the announcement, stick with official
# cabinet resolutions in the data while recording the prime minister's
# announcement as a comment.  This is how we treated a similar situation in
# Rio de Janeiro in spring 1993.

# Mongolia

# Shanks & Pottenger say that Mongolia has three time zones, but
# The USNO (1995-12-21) and the CIA map Standard Time Zones of the World
# (2005-03) both say that it has just one.

# From Oscar van Vlijmen (1999-12-11):
# General Information Mongolia
# <http://www.mongoliatourism.gov.mn/general.htm> (1999-09)
# "Time: Mongolia has two time zones. Three westernmost provinces of
# Bayan-Ölgii, Uvs, and Hovd are one hour earlier than the capital city, and
# the rest of the country follows the Ulaanbaatar time, which is UTC/GMT plus
# eight hours."

# From Rives McDow (1999-12-13):
# Mongolia discontinued the use of daylight savings time in 1999; 1998
# being the last year it was implemented.  The dates of implementation I am
# unsure of, but most probably it was similar to Russia, except for the time
# of implementation may have been different....
# Some maps in the past have indicated that there was an additional time
# zone in the eastern part of Mongolia, including the provinces of Dornod,
# Sükhbaatar, and possibly Khentii.

# From Paul Eggert (1999-12-15):
# Naming and spelling is tricky in Mongolia.
# We'll use Hovd (also spelled Chovd and Khovd) to represent the west zone;
# the capital of the Hovd province is sometimes called Hovd, sometimes Dund-Us,
# and sometimes Jirgalanta (with variant spellings), but the name Hovd
# is good enough for our purposes.

# From Rives McDow (2001-05-13):
# In addition to Mongolia starting daylight savings as reported earlier
# (adopted DST on 2001-04-27 02:00 local time, ending 2001-09-28),
# there are three time zones.
#
# Provinces [at 7:00]: Bayan-Ölgii, Uvs, Khovd, Zavkhan, Govi-Altai
# Provinces [at 8:00]: Khövsgöl, Bulgan, Arkhangai, Khentii, Töv,
#	Bayankhongor, Övörkhangai, Dundgovi, Dornogovi, Ömnögovi
# Provinces [at 9:00]: Dornod, Sükhbaatar
#
# [The province of Selenge is omitted from the above lists.]

# From Ganbold Ts., Ulaanbaatar (2004-04-17):
# Daylight saving occurs at 02:00 local time last Saturday of March.
# It will change back to normal at 02:00 local time last Saturday of
# September.... As I remember this rule was changed in 2001.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2004-04-17):
# For now, assume Rives McDow's informant got confused about Friday vs
# Saturday, and that his 2001 dates should have 1 added to them.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-07-26):
# We have wildly conflicting information about Mongolia's time zones.
# Bill Bonnet (2005-05-19) reports that the US Embassy in Ulaanbaatar says
# there is only one time zone and that DST is observed, citing Microsoft
# Windows XP as the source.  Risto Nykänen (2005-05-16) reports that
# travelmongolia.org says there are two time zones (UT +07, +08) with no DST.
# Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-05-20) reports that the Mongolian Embassy in
# Washington, DC says there are two time zones, with DST observed.
# He also found
# http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/index.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1111634894&archive=&start_from=&ucat=1&
# which also says that there is DST, and which has a comment by "Toddius"
# (2005-03-31 06:05 +0700) saying "Mongolia actually has 3.5 time zones.
# The West (OLGII) is +7 GMT, most of the country is ULAT is +8 GMT
# and some Eastern provinces are +9 GMT but Sükhbaatar Aimag is SUHK +8.5 GMT.
# The SUKH timezone is new this year, it is one of the few things the
# parliament passed during the tumultuous winter session."
# For now, let's ignore this information, until we have more confirmation.

# From Ganbold Ts. (2007-02-26):
# Parliament of Mongolia has just changed the daylight-saving rule in February.
# They decided not to adopt daylight-saving time....
# http://www.mongolnews.mn/index.php?module=unuudur&sec=view&id=15742

# From Deborah Goldsmith (2008-03-30):
# We received a bug report claiming that the tz database UTC offset for
# Asia/Choibalsan (GMT+09:00) is incorrect, and that it should be GMT
# +08:00 instead. Different sources appear to disagree with the tz
# database on this, e.g.:
#
# https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=1026
# http://www.worldtimeserver.com/current_time_in_MN.aspx
#
# both say GMT+08:00.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-03-31):
# eznis airways, which operates several domestic flights, has a flight
# schedule here:
# http://www.eznis.com/Container.jsp?id=112
# (click the English flag for English)
#
# There it appears that flights between Choibalsan and Ulaanbaatar arrive
# about 1:35 - 1:50 hours later in local clock time, no matter the
# direction, while Ulaanbaatar-Khovd takes 2 hours in the Eastern
# direction and 3:35 back, which indicates that Ulaanbaatar and Khovd are
# in different time zones (like we know about), while Choibalsan and
# Ulaanbaatar are in the same time zone (correction needed).

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-05-19):
# Assume that Choibalsan is indeed offset by 8:00.

# From Heitor David Pinto (2024-06-23):
# Sources about time zones in Mongolia seem to list one of two conflicting
# configurations.  The first configuration, mentioned in a comment to the TZ
# database in 1999, citing a Mongolian government website, lists the provinces
# of Bayan-Ölgii, Khovd and Uvs in UTC+7, and the rest of the country in
# UTC+8.  The second configuration, mentioned in a comment to the database in
# 2001, lists Bayan-Ölgii, Khovd, Uvs, Govi-Altai and Zavkhan in UTC+7, Dornod
# and Sükhbaatar in UTC+9, and the rest of the country in UTC+8.
#
# The first configuration is still mentioned by several Mongolian travel
# agencies:
# https://www.adventurerider.mn/en/page/about_mongolia
# http://www.naturetours.mn/nt/mongolia.php
# https://www.newjuulchin.mn/web/content/7506?unique=fa24a0f6e96e022a3578ee5195ac879638c734ce
#
# It also matches these flight schedules in 2013:
# http://web.archive.org/web/20130722023600/https://www.hunnuair.com/en/timetabled
# The flight times imply that the airports of Uliastai (Zavkhan), Choibalsan
# (Dornod) and Altai (Govi-Altai) are in the same time zone as Ulaanbaatar,
# and Khovd is one hour behind....
#
# The second configuration was mentioned by an official of the Mongolian
# standards agency in an interview in 2014: https://ikon.mn/n/9v6
# And it's still listed by the Mongolian aviation agency:
# https://ais.mn/files/aip/eAIP/2023-12-25/html/eSUP/ZM-eSUP-23-04-en-MN.html
#
# ... I believe that the first configuration is what is actually observed in
# Mongolia and has been so all along, at least since 1999.  The second
# configuration closely matches the ideal time zone boundaries at 97.5° E and
# 112.5° E but it doesn't seem to be used in practice.

# From Ganbold Tsagaankhuu (2015-03-10):
# It seems like yesterday Mongolian Government meeting has concluded to use
# daylight saving time in Mongolia....  Starting at 2:00AM of last Saturday of
# March 2015, daylight saving time starts.  And 00:00AM of last Saturday of
# September daylight saving time ends.  Source:

# Pakistan

# From Rives McDow (2002-03-13):
# I have been advised that Pakistan has decided to adopt dst on a
# TRIAL basis for one year, starting 00:01 local time on April 7, 2002
# and ending at 00:01 local time October 6, 2002.  This is what I was
# told, but I believe that the actual time of change may be 00:00; the
# 00:01 was to make it clear which day it was on.

# From Paul Eggert (2002-03-15):
# Jesper Nørgaard found this URL:
# http://www.pak.gov.pk/public/news/app/app06_dec.htm
# (dated 2001-12-06) which says that the Cabinet adopted a scheme "to
# advance the clocks by one hour on the night between the first
# Saturday and Sunday of April and revert to the original position on
# 15th October each year".  This agrees with McDow's 04-07 at 00:00,
# but disagrees about the October transition, and makes it sound like
# it's not on a trial basis.  Also, the "between the first Saturday
# and Sunday of April" phrase, if taken literally, means that the
# transition takes place at 00:00 on the first Sunday on or after 04-02.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-02-09):

# From Steffen Thorsen (2003-03-14):

#
# ISLAMABAD, March 6: Information and Media Development Minister Sheikh
# Rashid Ahmed on Thursday said the cabinet had reversed a previous
# decision to advance clocks by one hour in summer and put them back by
# one hour in winter with the aim of saving light hours and energy.

# The minister told a news conference that the experiment had rather

# Palestine

# From Amos Shapir (1998-02-15):
#
# From 1917 until 1948-05-15, all of Palestine, including the parts now
# known as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, was under British rule.
# Therefore the rules given for Israel for that period, apply there too...
#
# The Gaza Strip was under Egyptian rule between 1948-05-15 until 1967-06-05
# (except a short occupation by Israel from 1956-11 till 1957-03, but no
# time zone was affected then).  It was never formally annexed to Egypt,
# though.
#
# The rest of Palestine was under Jordanian rule at that time, formally
# annexed in 1950 as the West Bank (and the word "Trans" was dropped from
# the country's previous name of "the Hashemite Kingdom of the
# Trans-Jordan").  So the rules for Jordan for that time apply.  Major
# towns in that area are Nablus (Shchem), El-Halil (Hebron), Ramallah, and
# East Jerusalem.
#
# Both areas were occupied by Israel in June 1967, but not annexed (except
# for East Jerusalem).  They were on Israel time since then; there might
# have been a Military Governor's order about time zones, but I'm not aware
# of any (such orders may have been issued semi-annually whenever summer
# time was in effect, but maybe the legal aspect of time was just neglected).
#
# The Palestinian Authority was established in 1993, and got hold of most
# towns in the West Bank and Gaza by 1995.  I know that in order to
# demonstrate...independence, they have been switching to
# summer time and back on a different schedule than Israel's, but I don't
# know when this was started, or what algorithm is used (most likely the
# Jordanian one).
#
# To summarize, the table should probably look something like that:
#
# Area \ when | 1918-1947 | 1948-1967 | 1967-1995 | 1996-
# ------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------
# Israel      | Zion      | Zion      | Zion      | Zion
# West bank   | Zion      | Jordan    | Zion      | Jordan
# Gaza        | Zion      | Egypt     | Zion      | Jordan
#
# I guess more info may be available from the PA's web page (if/when they

# Shanks & Pottenger write that Gaza did not observe DST until 1957, but go
# with Shapir and assume that it observed DST from 1940 through 1947,
# and that it used Jordanian rules starting in 1996.
# We don't yet need a separate entry for the West Bank, since
# the only differences between it and Gaza that we know about
# occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
# However, as we get more information, we may need to add entries
# for parts of the West Bank as they transitioned from Israel's rules
# to Palestine's rules.

# From IINS News Service - Israel - 1998-03-23 10:38:07 Israel time,
# forwarded by Ephraim Silverberg:
#
# Despite the fact that Israel changed over to daylight savings time
# last week, the PLO Authority (PA) has decided not to turn its clocks
# one-hour forward at this time.  As a sign of independence from Israeli rule,
# the PA has decided to implement DST in April.

# From Paul Eggert (1999-09-20):
# Daoud Kuttab writes in Holiday havoc
# http://www.jpost.com/com/Archive/22.Apr.1999/Opinion/Article-2.html
# (Jerusalem Post, 1999-04-22) that
# the Palestinian National Authority changed to DST on 1999-04-15.
# I vaguely recall that they switch back in October (sorry, forgot the source).
# For now, let's assume that the spring switch was at 24:00,
# and that they switch at 0:00 on the 3rd Fridays of April and October.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-11-22):
# Starting 2004 transitions are from Steffen Thorsen's web site timeanddate.com.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2005-11-23):
# A user from Gaza reported that Gaza made the change early because of
# the Ramadan.  Next year Ramadan will be even earlier, so I think
# there is a good chance next year's end date will be around two weeks
# earlier - the same goes for Jordan.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-08-17):
# I was informed by a user in Bethlehem that in Bethlehem it started the
# same day as Israel, and after checking with other users in the area, I
# was informed that they started DST one day after Israel.  I was not
# able to find any authoritative sources at the time, nor details if
# Gaza changed as well, but presumed Gaza to follow the same rules as
# the West Bank.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-09-26):
# according to the Palestine News Network (2006-09-19):

# > The Council of Ministers announced that this year its winter schedule
# > will begin early, as of midnight Thursday.  It is also time to turn
# > back the clocks for winter.  Friday will begin an hour late this week.
# I guess it is likely that next year's date will be moved as well,
# because of the Ramadan.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2007-09-18):
# According to Steffen Thorsen's web site the Gaza Strip and the rest of the
# Palestinian territories left DST early on 13.th. of September at 2:00.

# From Paul Eggert (2007-09-20):
# My understanding is that Gaza and the West Bank disagree even over when
# the weekend is (Thursday+Friday versus Friday+Saturday), so I'd be a bit
# surprised if they agreed about DST.  But for now, assume they agree.
# For lack of better information, predict that future changes will be
# the 2nd Thursday of September at 02:00.

# to DST at 02:00 the second Saturday after Ramadan, and that
# if the normal spring-forward or fall-back transition occurs during
# Ramadan the former is delayed and the latter advanced.
# To implement this, I predicted Ramadan-oriented transition dates for
# 2026 through 2086 by running the following program under GNU Emacs 29.2,
# with the results integrated by hand into the table below.
# Predictions after 2086 are approximated without Ramadan.

# From Paul Eggert (2024-01-21):
# The Spanish initially used American (west-of-Greenwich) time.
# It is unknown what time Manila kept when the British occupied it from
# 1762-10-06 through 1764-04; for now assume it kept American time.
# On 1844-08-16, Narciso Clavería, governor-general of the
# Philippines, issued a proclamation announcing that 1844-12-30 was to
# be immediately followed by 1845-01-01; see R.H. van Gent's

#
# During WWII, Proclamation No. 789 fixed two periods of DST. The first period
# was set to continue only until January 31, 1942. But Manila was occupied by
# the Japanese earlier in the month....
#
# For the date of the adoption of standard time, Shank[s] gives 1899-05-11.
# The article is not able to state the basis of that. I guess it was based on
# a US War Department Circular issued on that date.
#	https://books.google.com/books?id=JZ1PAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA3-PA8
#
# However, according to other sources, standard time was adopted on
# 1899-09-06.  Also, the LMT was GMT+8:03:52

# From Paul Eggert (2024-09-05):
# The penultimate URL in P Chan's email refers to page 521 of
# Selga M, The Time Service in the Philippines.
# Proc Pan-Pacific Science Congress. Vol. 1 (1923), 519-532.
# It says, "The change from the meridian 120° 58' 04" to the 120th implied a
# change of 3 min. 52s.26 in time; consequently on 6th September, 1899,
# Manila Observatory gave the noon signal 3 min. 52s.26 later than before".
#
# Wikipedia says the US declared Manila liberated on March 4, 1945;
# this doesn't affect clocks, just our time zone abbreviation and DST flag.

# From Paul Goyette (2018-06-15) with URLs updated by Guy Harris (2024-02-15):
# In the Philippines, there is a national law, Republic Act No. 10535
# which declares the official time here as "Philippine Standard Time".
# The act [1] even specifies use of PST as the abbreviation, although
# the FAQ provided by PAGASA [2] uses the "acronym PhST to distinguish
# it from the Pacific Standard Time (PST)."

# [2] https://prsd.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/index.php/28-astronomy/302-philippine-standard-time
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-06-19):
# I surveyed recent news reports, and my impression is that "PST" is
# more popular among reliable English-language news sources.  This is
# not just a measure of Google hit counts: it's also the sizes and
# influence of the sources.  There is no current abbreviation for DST,
# so use "PDT", the usual American style.

# Saudi Arabia
#
# Japan's year-round bases in Antarctica match this since 1970.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-08-29):
# Time in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian peninsula was not
# standardized until 1968 or so; we don't know exactly when, and possibly it
# has never been made official.  Richard P Hunt, in "Islam city yielding to
# modern times", New York Times (1961-04-09), p 20, wrote that only airlines
# observed standard time, and that people in Jeddah mostly observed quasi-solar
# time, doing so by setting their watches at sunrise to 6 o'clock (or to 12
# o'clock for "Arab" time).
#
# Timekeeping differed depending on who you were and which part of Saudi
# Arabia you were in.  In 1969, Elias Antar wrote that although a common
# practice had been to set one's watch to 12:00 (i.e., midnight) at sunset -
# which meant that the time on one side of a mountain could differ greatly from
# the time on the other side - many foreigners set their watches to 6pm
# instead, while airlines instead used UTC +03 (except in Dhahran, where they
# used UTC +04), Aramco used UTC +03 with DST, and the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line
# Company used Aramco time in eastern Saudi Arabia and airline time in western.
# (The American Military Aid Advisory Group used plain UTC.)  Antar writes,
# "A man named Higgins, so the story goes, used to run a local power
# station. One day, the whole thing became too much for Higgins and he
# assembled his staff and laid down the law. 'I've had enough of this,' he
# shrieked. 'It is now 12 o'clock Higgins Time, and from now on this station is
# going to run on Higgins Time.' And so, until last year, it did."  See:
# Antar E. Dinner at When? Saudi Aramco World, 1969 March/April. 2-3.
# http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/196902/dinner.at.when.htm
# Also see: Antar EN. Arabian flying is confusing.
# Port Angeles (WA) Evening News. 1965-03-10. page 3.
#
# The TZ database cannot represent quasi-solar time; airline time is the best
# we can do.  The 1946 foreign air news digest of the U.S. Civil Aeronautics
# Board (OCLC 42299995) reported that the "... Arabian Government, inaugurated
# a weekly Dhahran-Cairo service, via the Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and
# Jidda, on March 14, 1947".  Shanks & Pottenger guessed 1950; go with the
# earlier date.
#
# Shanks & Pottenger also state that until 1968-05-01 Saudi Arabia had two
# time zones; the other zone, at UT +04, was in the far eastern part of
# the country.  Presumably this is documenting airline time.  Ignore this,
# as it's before our 1970 cutoff.

# Sri Lanka

# From Paul Eggert (2013-02-21):
# Milne says "Madras mean time use from May 1, 1898.  Prior to this Colombo
# mean time, 5h. 4m. 21.9s. F., was used."  But 5:04:21.9 differs considerably
# from Colombo's meridian 5:19:24, so for now ignore Milne and stick with
# Shanks and Pottenger.

# From Paul Eggert (1996-09-03):
# "Sri Lanka advances clock by an hour to avoid blackout"
# (<http://www.virtual-pc.com/lankaweb/news/items/240596-2.html>, 1996-05-24,
# no longer available as of 1999-08-17)
# reported "the country's standard time will be put forward by one hour at
# midnight Friday (1830 GMT) 'in the light of the present power crisis'."
#
# From Dharmasiri Senanayake, Sri Lanka Media Minister (1996-10-24), as quoted
# by Shamindra in Daily News - Hot News Section
# <news:54rka5$m5h@mtinsc01-mgt.ops.worldnet.att.net> (1996-10-26):
# With effect from 12.30 a.m. on 26th October 1996
# Sri Lanka will be six (06) hours ahead of GMT.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2006-04-14), quoting Sri Lanka News Online
# <http://news.sinhalaya.com/wmview.php?ArtID=11002> (2006-04-13):
# 0030 hrs on April 15, 2006 (midnight of April 14, 2006 +30 minutes)
# at present, become 2400 hours of April 14, 2006 (midnight of April 14, 2006).

# From Peter Apps and Ranga Sirila of Reuters (2006-04-12) in:

# [The Tamil Tigers] never accepted the original 1996 time change and simply
# kept their clocks set five and a half hours ahead of Greenwich Mean
# Time (GMT), in line with neighbor India.
# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-18):
# People who live in regions under Tamil control can use [TZ='Asia/Kolkata'],
# as that zone has agreed with the Tamil areas since our cutoff date of 1970.

# From Sadika Sumanapala (2016-10-19):
# According to http://www.sltime.org (maintained by Measurement Units,
# Standards & Services Department, Sri Lanka) abbreviation for Sri Lanka
# standard time is SLST.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2016-10-18):
# "SLST" seems to be reasonably recent and rarely used outside time
# zone nerd sources.  I searched Google News and found three uses of
# it in the International Business Times of India in February and
# March of this year when discussing cricket match times, but nothing
# since then (though there has been a lot of cricket) and nothing in
# other English-language news sources.  Our old abbreviation "LKT" is
# even worse.  For now, let's use a numeric abbreviation; we can
# switch to "SLST" if it catches on.

# not take place 1st November at 0:00 o'clock but 1st November at 24:00 or
# rather Midnight between Thursday and Friday. This does make more sense than
# having it between Wednesday and Thursday (two workdays in Syria) since the
# weekend in Syria is not Saturday and Sunday, but Friday and Saturday. So now
# it is implemented at midnight of the last workday before weekend...

# Here's a link to English-language coverage by the Syrian Arab News
# Agency (SANA)...
# http://www.sana.sy/eng/21/2008/03/11/165173.htm
# ...which reads (in part) "The Cabinet approved the suggestion of the
# Ministry of Electricity to begin daylight savings time on Friday April
# 4th, advancing clocks one hour ahead on midnight of Thursday April 3rd."
# Since Syria is two hours east of UTC, the 2200 and 2100 transition times
# shown above match up with midnight in Syria.

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-18):
# My best guess at a Syrian rule is "the Friday nearest April 1";
# coding that involves either using a "Mar Fri>=29" construct that old time zone
# compilers can't handle  or having multiple Rules (a la Israel).
# For now, use "Apr Fri>=1", and go with IATA on a uniform Sep 30 end.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-10-07):
# Syria has now officially decided to end DST on 2008-11-01 this year,
# according to the following article in the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA).
#
# The article is in Arabic, and seems to tell that they will go back to
# winter time on 2008-11-01 at 00:00 local daylight time (delaying/setting
# clocks back 60 minutes).

# From Arthur David Olson (2009-10-28):
# We'll see if future DST switching times turn out to be end of the last
# Thursday of the month or the start of the last Friday of the month or
# something else. For now, use the start of the last Friday.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-10-04):
# Milne gives 7:16:56 for the meridian of Saigon in 1899, as being
# used in Lower Laos, Cambodia, and Annam.  But this is quite a ways

# and Pottenger for LMT before 1906.

# From Paul Eggert (2024-01-14) after a 2014 heads-up from Trần Ngọc Quân
# and a 2024-01-14 heads-up from Đoàn Trần Công Danh:
# Trần Tiến Bình's authoritative book "Lịch Việt Nam: thế kỷ XX-XXI (1901-2100)"
# (Nhà xuất bản Văn Hoá - Thông Tin, Hanoi, 2005), pp 49-50,
# is quoted verbatim in:

# is translated by Brian Inglis in:
# https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2014-October/021654.html
# and is the basis for the information below.
#
# The 1906 transition was effective July 1 and standardized Indochina to
# Phù Liễn Observatory, legally 104° 17' 17" east of Paris.
# It's unclear whether this meant legal Paris Mean Time (00:09:21) or
# the Paris Meridian; for now guess the former and round the exact
# 07:06:30.1333... to 07:06:30.13 as the legal spec used 66 2/3 ms precision.
# which is used below even though the modern-day Phù Liễn Observatory
# is closer to 07:06:31.  Abbreviate Phù Liễn Mean Time as PLMT.
#
# The following transitions occurred in Indochina in general (before 1954)
# and in South Vietnam in particular (after 1954):
# To 07:00 on 1911-05-01.
# To 08:00 on 1942-12-31 at 23:00.
# To 09:00 on 1945-03-14 at 23:00.
# To 07:00 on 1945-09-02 in Vietnam.
# To 08:00 on 1947-04-01 in French-controlled Indochina.
# To 07:00 on 1955-07-01 in South Vietnam.
# To 08:00 on 1959-12-31 at 23:00 in South Vietnam.
# To 07:00 on 1975-06-13 in South Vietnam.

# http://baochi.nlv.gov.vn/baochi/cgi-bin/baochi?a=d&d=JwvzO19450929.2.5&dliv=none
# It says that on 1945-09-01 at 24:00, Vietnam moved back two hours, to +07.

# The Ho Chi Minh entry suffices for most purposes as it agrees with all of
# Vietnam since 1975-06-13.  Presumably clocks often changed in south Vietnam
# in the early 1970s as locations changed hands during the war; however the
# details are unknown and would likely be too voluminous for this database.
#
# For timestamps in north Vietnam back to 1970 (the tzdb cutoff),
# use Asia/Bangkok; see the VN entries in the file zone1970.tab.
