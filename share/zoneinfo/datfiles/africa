# 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.

# This file is by no means authoritative; if you think you know better,

# From Paul Eggert (2018-05-27):
#
# Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
# Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
#
# Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
# for time zone data was the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
# IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
#
# Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
# Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
# I found in the UCLA library.
#
# For data circa 1899, a common source is:
# Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899 Feb;13(2):173-94.
# https://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359
#
# For the 1911/1912 establishment of standard time in French possessions, see:
# Société Française de Physique, Recueil de constantes physiques (1913),
# page 752, 18b.
#
# European-style abbreviations are commonly used along the Mediterranean.
# For sub-Saharan Africa abbreviations were less standardized.
# Previous editions of this database used WAT, CAT, SAT, and EAT
# for UT +00 through +03, respectively,
# but in 1997 Mark R V Murray reported that
# 'SAST' is the official abbreviation for +02 in the country of South Africa,
# 'CAT' is commonly used for +02 in countries north of South Africa, and
# 'WAT' is probably the best name for +01, as the common phrase for
# the area that includes Nigeria is "West Africa".
#
# To summarize, the following abbreviations seemed to have some currency:
#	 +00	GMT	Greenwich Mean Time
#	 +02	CAT	Central Africa Time
#	 +02	SAST	South Africa Standard Time
# and Murray suggested the following abbreviation:
#	 +01	WAT	West Africa Time
# Murray's suggestion seems to have caught on in news reports and the like.
# I vaguely recall 'WAT' also being used for -01 in the past but
# cannot now come up with solid citations.
#
# I invented the following abbreviations in the 1990s:
#	 +02	WAST	West Africa Summer Time
#	 +03	CAST	Central Africa Summer Time
#	 +03	SAST	South Africa Summer Time
#	 +03	EAT	East Africa Time
# 'EAT' seems to have caught on and is in current timestamps, and though
# the other abbreviations are rarer and are only in past timestamps,
# they are paired with better-attested non-DST abbreviations.
# Corrections are welcome.

# From Abdelrahman Hassan (2007-09-06):
# Due to the Hijri (lunar Islamic calendar) year being 11 days shorter
# than the year of the Gregorian calendar, Ramadan shifts earlier each
# year. This year it will be observed September 13 (September is quite
# hot in Egypt), and the idea is to make fasting easier for workers by
# shifting business hours one hour out of daytime heat. Consequently,
# unless discontinued, next DST may end Thursday 28 August 2008.
# From Paul Eggert (2007-08-17):
# For lack of better info, assume the new rule is last Thursday in August.

# Mauritius

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-06-25):
# Mauritius plans to observe DST from 2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31 on a trial
# basis....
# It seems that Mauritius observed daylight saving time from 1982-10-10 to
# 1983-03-20 as well, but that was not successful....
# https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/mauritius-daylight-saving-time.html

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-06-25):
# http://economicdevelopment.gov.mu/portal/site/Mainhomepage/menuitem.a42b24128104d9845dabddd154508a0c/?content_id=0a7cee8b5d69a110VgnVCM1000000a04a8c0RCRD

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-06-30):
# The www.timeanddate.com article cited by Steffen Thorsen notes that "A
# final decision has yet to be made on the times that daylight saving
# would begin and end on these dates." As a place holder, use midnight.

# From Paul Eggert (2008-06-30):
# Follow Thorsen on DST in 1982/1983, instead of Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-07-10):
# According to
# http://www.lexpress.mu/display_article.php?news_id=111216
# (in French), Mauritius will start and end their DST a few days earlier
# than previously announced (2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31).  The new start
# date is 2008-10-26 at 02:00 and the new end date is 2009-03-27 (no time
# given, but it is probably at either 2 or 3 wall clock time).
#
# A little strange though, since the article says that they moved the date
# to align itself with Europe and USA which also change time on that date,
# but that means they have not paid attention to what happened in
# USA/Canada last year (DST ends first Sunday in November). I also wonder
# why that they end on a Friday, instead of aligning with Europe which
# changes two days later.

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-07-11):
# Seems that English language article "The revival of daylight saving
# time: Energy conservation?"- No. 16578 (07/11/2008) was originally
# published on Monday, June 30, 2008...
#
# I guess that article in French "Le gouvernement avance l'introduction
# de l'heure d'été" stating that DST in Mauritius starting on October 26
# and ending on March 27, 2009 is the most recent one....

# last Sunday of October and will end at two o'clock in the morning on
# the last Sunday of March the following year. The summer time for the
# year 2008-2009 will, therefore, be effective as from 26 October 2008

# Morocco's daylight-saving transitions due to Ramadan seem to be
# announced a bit in advance.  On 2012-07-11 the Moroccan government
# announced that year's Ramadan daylight-saving transitions would be
# 2012-07-20 and 2012-08-20; see
# http://www.mmsp.gov.ma/fr/actualites.aspx?id=288

# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-09-28):
# Morocco extends DST by one month, on very short notice, just 1 day
# before it was going to end.  There is a new decree (2.13.781) for
# this, where DST from now on goes from last Sunday of March at 02:00
# to last Sunday of October at 03:00, similar to EU rules.  Official

# (Google Translation) The hour will thus be delayed 60 minutes
# Sunday, June 14 at 3:00, the ministry said in a statement, adding
# that the time will be advanced again 60 minutes Sunday, July 19,
# 2015 at 2:00.  The move comes under 2.12.126 Decree of 26 Jumada I
# 1433 (18 April 2012) and the decision of the Head of Government of

# [The gov.ma announcement] would (probably) make the switch on 2015-07-19 go

# From Milamber (2020-05-31)
# In Morocco (where I live), the end of Ramadan (Arabic month) is followed by
# the Eid al-Fitr, and concretely it's 1 or 2 day offs for the people (with
# traditional visiting of family, big lunches/dinners, etc.).  So for this
# year the astronomical calculations don't include the following 2 days off in
# the calc.  These 2 days fall in a Sunday/Monday, so it's not acceptable by
# people to have a time shift during these 2 days off.  Perhaps you can modify
# the (predicted) rules for next years: if the end of Ramadan is a (probable)
# Friday or Saturday (and so the 2 days off are on a weekend), the next time
# shift will be the next weekend.

# Mozambique
#

# For timestamps before Mozambique's independence, see commentary for

#
# From Paul Eggert (2024-05-24):
# The London Gazette, 1903-04-03, page 2245, says that
# as of 1903-03-03 a time ball at the port of Lourenço Marques
# (as Maputo was then called) was dropped daily at 13:00:00 LMT,
# corresponding to 22:49:41.7 GMT, so local time was +02:10:18.3.
# Conversely, the newspaper South Africa, 1909-02-09, page 321,
# says the port had just installed an apparatus that communicated
# "from the controlling clock in the new Observatory at Reuben Point ...
# exact mean South African time, i.e., 30 deg., or 2 hours East of Greenwich".
# Although Shanks gives 1903-03-01 for the transition to CAT,
# evidently the port transitioned to CAT after 1903-03-03 but before
# the Portuguese legal transition of 1912-01-01 (see Europe/Lisbon commentary).
# For lack of better info, list 1909 as the transition date.

# Namibia

# From Arthur David Olson (2017-08-09):
# The text of the "Namibia Time Act, 1994" is available online at
# www.lac.org.na/laws/1994/811.pdf
# and includes this nugget:
# Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2) of section 1, the
# first winter period after the commencement of this Act shall
# commence at OOhOO on Monday 21 March 1994 and shall end at 02h00 on
# Sunday 4 September 1994.

# From Michael Deckers (2017-04-06):
# ... both summer and winter time are called "standard"
# (which differs from the use in Ireland) ...

# From Petronella Sibeene (2007-03-30):
# http://allafrica.com/stories/200703300178.html
# While the entire country changes its time, Katima Mulilo and other
# settlements in Caprivi unofficially will not because the sun there
# rises and sets earlier compared to other regions.  Chief of
# Forecasting Riaan van Zyl explained that the far eastern parts of
# the country are close to 40 minutes earlier in sunrise than the rest
# of the country.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-02-22):
# Although the Zambezi Region (formerly known as Caprivi) informally

# This video is from the government decision:

# http://ddsnext.crl.edu/titles/31558#?c=0&m=668&s=0&cv=2&r=0&xywh=1446,5221,1931,1235
# says "It is officially notified that on and after the 1st of July 1905
# Greenwich Mean Solar Time will be adopted throughout the Colony and

#
# From P Chan (2020-11-27):
# On 1914-01-01, standard time of GMT+0:30 was adopted for the unified Nigeria.

# "On January 1st [1914], a universal standard time for Nigeria was adopted,
# viz., half an hour fast on Greenwich mean time, corresponding to the meridian
# 7° 30' E. long."
# Lloyd's Register of Shipping (1915) says "Hitherto the time observed in Lagos
# was the local mean time. On 1st January, 1914, standard time for the whole of
# Nigeria was introduced ... Lagos time has been advanced about 16 minutes
# accordingly."
#
# In 1919, standard time was changed to GMT+1.

# "The expression 'Standard time' means standard time as used in Nigeria:

# From Tim Parenti (2020-12-10):

# "The proposal is that the Globe should be divided into twelve zones East and
# West of Greenwich, of one hour each, Nigeria falling into the zone with a
# standard of one hour fast on Greenwich Mean Time.  Nigeria standard time is
# now 30 minutes in advance of Greenwich Mean Time ... according to the new

# and dated 2005-04-26, "Tunisia has decided to advance its official time by

# From Arthur David Olson (2009-03-18):
# The Tunis Afrique Presse News Agency notice contains this: "This measure is

# unchanged the whole year long."  So foregoing DST seems to be an exception
# (albeit one that may be repeated in the future).
