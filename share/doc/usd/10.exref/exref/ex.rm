.I Ex
a line oriented text editor, which supports both command and display
oriented editing.
This reference manual describes the command oriented part of
.I ex;
the display editing features of
.I ex
are described in
.I "An Introduction to Display Editing with Vi."

.FE
Each instance of the editor has a set of options,
which can be set to tailor it to your liking.
The command
.I edit
invokes a version of
.I ex
designed for more casual or beginning
users by changing the default settings of some of these options.
To simplify the description which follows we
assume the default settings of the options.
.PP
When invoked,
.I ex
determines the terminal type from the \s-2TERM\s0 variable in the environment.
It there is a \s-2TERMCAP\s0 variable in the environment, and the type
of the terminal described there matches the \s-2TERM\s0 variable,
then that description
is used.  Also if the \s-2TERMCAP\s0 variable contains a pathname (beginning
with a \fB/\fR) then the editor will seek the description of the terminal
in that file (rather than the default /etc/termcap).
If there is a variable \s-2EXINIT\s0 in the environment, then the editor
will execute the commands in that variable,
otherwise if there is a file
.I \&.exrc
in your \s-2HOME\s0 directory
.I ex
reads commands from that file, simulating a
.I source
command.
Option setting commands placed in
\s-2EXINIT\s0 or
.I \&.exrc
will be executed before each editor session.
.PP
A command to enter
.I ex
has the following prototype:\(dg

.DE
The most common case edits a single file with no options, i.e.:
.DS
\fBex\fR name
.DE
The
.B \-
command line option
option suppresses all interactive-user feedback
and is useful in processing editor scripts in command files.
The
.B \-v
option is equivalent to using
.I vi
rather than
.I ex.
The
.B \-t
option is equivalent to an initial
.I tag
command, editing the file containing the
.I tag
and positioning the editor at its definition.
The
.B \-r
option is used in recovering after an editor or system crash,
retrieving the last saved version of the named file or,
if no file is specified,
typing a list of saved files.
The
.B \-l
option sets up for editing \s-2LISP\s0, setting the
.I showmatch
and
.I lisp
options.
The
.B \-w
option sets the default window size to
.I n,
and is useful on dialups to start in small windows.
The
.B \-x
option causes
.I ex
to prompt for a
.I key ,
which is used to encrypt and decrypt the contents of the file,
which should already be encrypted using the same key,
see
.I crypt (1).
The
.B \-R
option sets the
.I readonly
option at the start.
.I Name
arguments indicate files to be edited.
An argument of the form
\fB+\fIcommand\fR
indicates that the editor should begin by executing the specified command.
If
.I command
is omitted, then it defaults to ``$'', positioning the editor at the last
line of the first file initially.  Other useful commands here are scanning
patterns of the form ``/pat'' or line numbers, e.g. ``+100'' starting
at line 100.
.NH 1
File manipulation
.NH 2
Current file
.PP
.I Ex
is normally editing the contents of a single file,
whose name is recorded in the
.I current
file name.
.I Ex
performs all editing actions in a buffer
(actually a temporary file)
into which the text of the file is initially read.
Changes made to the buffer have no effect on the file being
edited unless and until the buffer contents are written out to the
file with a
.I write
command.
After the buffer contents are written,
the previous contents of the written file are no longer accessible.
When a file is edited,
its name becomes the current file name,
and its contents are read into the buffer.
.PP
The current file is almost always considered to be
.I edited.
This means that the contents of the buffer are logically
connected with the current file name,
so that writing the current buffer contents onto that file,
even if it exists,
is a reasonable action.
If the current file is not 
.I edited
then
.I ex
will not normally write on it if it already exists.*
.FS
* The
.I file
command will say ``[Not edited]'' if the current file is not considered
edited.
.FE
.NH 2
Alternate file
.PP
Each time a new value is given to the current file name,
the previous current file name is saved as the
.I alternate
file name.
Similarly if a file is mentioned but does not become the current file,
it is saved as the alternate file name.
.NH 2
Filename expansion
.PP
Filenames within the editor may be specified using the normal
shell expansion conventions.
In addition,
the character `%' in filenames is replaced by the
.I current
file name and the character
`#' by the
.I alternate
file name.\(dg
.FS
\(dg This makes it easy to deal alternately with
two files and eliminates the need for retyping the
name supplied on an
.I edit
command after a 
.I "No write since last change"
diagnostic is received.
.FE
.NH 2
Multiple files and named buffers
.PP
If more than one file is given on the command line,
then the first file is edited as described above.
The remaining arguments are placed with the first file in the
.I "argument list."
The current argument list may be displayed with the
.I args
command.
The next file in the argument list may be edited with the
.I next
command.
The argument list may also be respecified by specifying
a list of names to the
.I next
command.
These names are expanded,
the resulting list of names becomes the new argument list,
and
.I ex
edits the first file on the list.
.PP
For saving blocks of text while editing, and especially when editing
more than one file,
.I ex
has a group of named buffers.
These are similar to the normal buffer, except that only a limited number
of operations are available on them.
The buffers have names
.I a
through
.I z.\(dd
.FS
\(dd It is also possible to refer to
.I A
through
.I Z;
the upper case buffers are the same as the lower but commands
append to named buffers rather than replacing
if upper case names are used.
.FE
.NH 2
Read only
.PP
It is possible to use
.I ex
in
.I "read only"
mode to look at files that you have no intention of modifying.
This mode protects you from accidently overwriting the file.
Read only mode is on when the
.I readonly
option is set.
It can be turned on with the
.B \-R
command line option,
by the
.I view
command line invocation,
or by setting the
.I readonly
option.
It can be cleared by setting
.I noreadonly .
It is possible to write, even while in read only mode, by indicating
that you really know what you are doing.
You can write to a different file, or can use the ! form of write,
even while in read only mode.
.NH 1
Exceptional Conditions
.NH 2
Errors and interrupts
.PP
When errors occur
.I ex
(optionally) rings the terminal bell and, in any case, prints an error
diagnostic.  If the primary input is from a file, editor processing
will terminate.  If an interrupt signal is received,
.I ex
prints ``Interrupt'' and returns to its command level.  If the primary
input is a file, then
.I ex
will exit when this occurs.
.NH 2
Recovering from hangups and crashes
.PP
If a hangup signal is received and the buffer has been modified since
it was last written out, or if the system crashes, either the editor
(in the first case) or the system (after it reboots in the second) will
attempt to preserve the buffer.  The next time you log in you should be
able to recover the work you were doing, losing at most a few lines of
changes from the last point before the hangup or editor crash.  To
recover a file you can use the
.B \-r
option.  If you were editing the file
.I resume,
then you should change
to the directory where you were when the crash occurred, giving the command
.DS
\fBex \-r\fP\fI resume\fP
.DE
After checking that the retrieved file is indeed ok, you can
.I write
it over the previous contents of that file.
.PP
You will normally get mail from the system telling you when a file has
been saved after a crash.  The command
.DS
\fBex\fP \-\fBr\fP
.DE
will print a list of the files which have been saved for you.
(In the case of a hangup,
the file will not appear in the list,
although it can be recovered.)
.NH 1
Editing modes
.PP
.I Ex
has five distinct modes.  The primary mode is
.I command
mode.  Commands are entered in command mode when a `:' prompt is
present, and are executed each time a complete line is sent.  In
.I "text input"
mode
.I ex
gathers input lines and places them in the file.  The
.I append,
.I insert,
and
.I change
commands use text input mode.
No prompt is printed when you are in text input mode.
This mode is left by typing a `.' alone at the beginning of a line, and
.I command
mode resumes.
.PP
The last three modes are
.I open
and
.I visual
modes, entered by the commands of the same name, and, within open and
visual modes
.I "text insertion"
mode.
.I Open
and
.I visual
modes allow local editing operations to be performed on the text in the
file.  The
.I open
command displays one line at a time on any terminal while
.I visual
works on \s-2CRT\s0 terminals with random positioning cursors, using the
screen as a (single) window for file editing changes.
These modes are described (only) in
.I "An Introduction to Display Editing with Vi."
.NH 
Command structure
.PP
Most command names are English words,
and initial prefixes of the words are acceptable abbreviations.
The ambiguity of abbreviations is resolved in favor of the more commonly
used commands.*
.FS
* As an example, the command 
.I substitute
can be abbreviated `s'
while the shortest available abbreviation for the 
.I set
command is `se'.
.FE
.NH 2
Command parameters
.PP
Most commands accept prefix addresses specifying the lines in the file
upon which they are to have effect.
The forms of these addresses will be discussed below.
A number of commands also may take a trailing
.I count
specifying the number of lines to be involved in the command.\(dg
.FS
\(dg Counts are rounded down if necessary.
.FE
Thus the command ``10p'' will print the tenth line in the buffer while
``delete 5'' will delete five lines from the buffer,
starting with the current line.
.PP
Some commands take other information or parameters,
this information always being given after the command name.\(dd
.FS
\(dd Examples would be option names in a
.I set
command i.e. ``set number'',
a file name in an
.I edit
command,
a regular expression in a
.I substitute
command,
or a target address for a
.I copy
command, i.e. ``1,5 copy 25''.
.FE
.NH 2
Command variants
.PP
A number of commands have two distinct variants.
The variant form of the command is invoked by placing an
`!' immediately after the command name.
Some of the default variants may be controlled by options;
in this case, the `!' serves to toggle the default.
.NH 2
Flags after commands
.PP
The characters `#', `p' and `l' may be placed after many commands.**
.FS
**
A `p' or `l' must be preceded by a blank or tab
except in the single special case `dp'.
.FE
In this case, the command abbreviated by these characters
is executed after the command completes.
Since
.I ex
normally prints the new current line after each change, `p' is rarely necessary.
Any number of `+' or `\-' characters may also be given with these flags.
If they appear, the specified offset is applied to the current line
value before the printing command is executed.
.NH 2
Comments
.PP
It is possible to give editor commands which are ignored.
This is useful when making complex editor scripts
for which comments are desired.
The comment character is the double quote: ".
Any command line beginning with " is ignored.
Comments beginning with " may also be placed at the ends
of commands, except in cases where they could be confused as part
of text (shell escapes and the substitute and map commands).
.NH 2
Multiple commands per line
.PP
More than one command may be placed on a line by separating each pair
of commands by a `|' character.
However the
.I global
commands,
comments,
and the shell escape `!'
must be the last command on a line, as they are not terminated by a `|'.
.NH 2
Reporting large changes
.PP
Most commands which change the contents of the editor buffer give
feedback if the scope of the change exceeds a threshold given by the
.I report
option.
This feedback helps to detect undesirably large changes so that they may
be quickly and easily reversed with an
.I undo.
After commands with more global effect such as
.I global
or
.I visual,
you will be informed if the net change in the number of lines
in the buffer during this command exceeds this threshold.
.NH 1
Command addressing
.NH 2
Addressing primitives
.IP \fB.\fR 20
The current line.
Most commands leave the current line as the last line which they affect.
The default address for most commands is the current line,
thus `\fB.\fR' is rarely used alone as an address.
.IP \fIn\fR 20
The \fIn\fRth line in the editor's buffer, lines being numbered
sequentially from 1.
.IP \fB$\fR 20
The last line in the buffer.
.IP \fB%\fR 20
An abbreviation for ``1,$'', the entire buffer.
.IP \fI+n\fR\ \fI\-n\fR 20
An offset relative to the current buffer line.\(dg
.FS
\(dg
The forms `.+3' `+3' and `+++' are all equivalent;
if the current line is line 100 they all address line 103.
.FE
.IP \fB/\fIpat\fR\fB/\fR\ \fB?\fIpat\fR\fB?\fR 20
Scan forward and backward respectively for a line containing \fIpat\fR, a
regular expression (as defined below).  The scans normally wrap around the end
of the buffer.
If all that is desired is to print the next line containing \fIpat\fR, then
the trailing \fB/\fR or \fB?\fR may be omitted.
If \fIpat\fP is omitted or explicitly empty, then the last
regular expression specified is located.\(dd
.FS
\(dd The forms \fB\e/\fP and \fB\e?\fP scan
using the last regular expression used in a scan; after a substitute
\fB//\fP and \fB??\fP would scan using the substitute's regular expression.
.FE
.IP \fB\(aa\(aa\fP\ \fB\(aa\fP\fIx\fP 20
Before each non-relative motion of the current line `\fB.\fP',
the previous current line is marked with a tag, subsequently referred to as
`\(aa\(aa'.
This makes it easy to refer or return to this previous context.
Marks may also be established by the
.I mark
command, using single lower case letters
.I x
and the marked lines referred to as
`\(aa\fIx\fR'.
.NH 2
Combining addressing primitives
.PP
Addresses to commands consist of a series of addressing primitives,
separated by `,' or `;'.
Such address lists are evaluated left-to-right.
When addresses are separated by `;' the current line `\fB.\fR'
is set to the value of the previous addressing expression
before the next address is interpreted.
If more addresses are given than the command requires,
then all but the last one or two are ignored.
If the command takes two addresses, the first addressed line must
precede the second in the buffer.\(dg
.FS
\(dg Null address specifications are permitted in a list of addresses,
the default in this case is the current line `.';
thus `,100' is equivalent to `\fB.\fR,100'.
It is an error to give a prefix address to a command which expects none.
.FE
.NH 1
Command descriptions
.PP
The following form is a prototype for all
.I ex
commands:
.DS
\fIaddress\fR \fBcommand\fR \fI! parameters count flags\fR
.DE
All parts are optional; the degenerate case is the empty command which prints
the next line in the file.  For sanity with use from within
.I visual
mode,
.I ex
ignores a ``:'' preceding any command.
.PP
In the following command descriptions, the
default addresses are shown in parentheses,
which are
.I not,
however,
part of the command.
.LC
\fBabbreviate\fR \fIword rhs\fP	abbr: \fBab\fP
.ZP
Add the named abbreviation to the current list.
When in input mode in visual, if
.I word

.I rhs .
.LC
( \fB.\fR ) \fBappend\fR	abbr: \fBa\fR
.br
\fItext\fR
.br
\&\fB.\fR
.ZP
Reads the input text and places it after the specified line.
After the command, `\fB.\fR'
addresses the last line input or the
specified line if no lines were input.
If address `0' is given,
text is placed at the beginning of the buffer.
.LC
\fBa!\fR
.br
\fItext\fR
.br
\&\fB.\fR
.ZP
The variant flag to
.I append
toggles the setting for the

.LC
( \fB.\fP , \fB.\fP ) \fBchange\fP \fIcount\fP	abbr: \fBc\fP
.br
\fItext\fP
.br

if no lines were input it is left as for a
\fIdelete\fP.
.LC
\fBc!\fP
.br
\fItext\fP
.br
\&\fB.\fP
.ZP
The variant toggles
.I autoindent
during the

.ig
.LC
\fBchdir\fR \fIdirectory\fR
.ZP
The specified \fIdirectory\fR becomes the current directory.
If no directory is specified, the current value of the
.I home
option is used as the target directory.
After a
.I chdir
the current file is not considered to have been
edited so that write restrictions on pre-existing files apply.
..
.LC
( \fB.\fP , \fB.\fP )\|\fBcopy\fP \fIaddr\fP \fIflags\fP	abbr: \fBco\fP
.ZP
A
.I copy
of the specified lines is placed after
.I addr,
which may be `0'.
The current line
`\fB.\fR'
addresses the last line of the copy.
The command
.I t
is a synonym for
.I copy.
.LC
( \fB.\fR , \fB.\fR )\|\fBdelete\fR \fIbuffer\fR \fIcount\fR \fIflags\fR	abbr: \fBd\fR
.ZP
Removes the specified lines from the buffer.
The line after the last line deleted becomes the current line;
if the lines deleted were originally at the end,
the new last line becomes the current line.
If a named
.I buffer
is specified by giving a letter,
then the specified lines are saved in that buffer,
or appended to it if an upper case letter is used.
.LC
\fBedit\fR \fIfile\fR	abbr: \fBe\fR
.br
\fBex\fR \fIfile\fR
.ZP
Used to begin an editing session on a new file.
The editor
first checks to see if the buffer has been modified since the last
.I write
command was issued.
If it has been,
a warning is issued and the
command is aborted.
The
command otherwise deletes the entire contents of the editor buffer,
makes the named file the current file and prints the new filename.
After insuring that this file is sensible\(dg
.FS
\(dg I.e., that it is not a binary file such as a directory,
a block or character special file other than
.I /dev/tty,
a terminal,
or a binary or executable file
(as indicated by the first word).
.FE
the editor reads the file into its buffer.
.IP
If the read of the file completes without error,
the number of lines and characters read is typed.
If there were any non-\s-2ASCII\s0 characters
in the file they are stripped of their non-\s-2ASCII\s0
high bits,
and any null characters in the file are discarded.
If none of these errors occurred, the file is considered
.I edited.
If the last line of the input file is missing the trailing
newline character, it will be supplied and a complaint will be issued.
This command leaves the current line `\fB.\fR' at the last line read.\(dd
.FS
\(dd If executed from within
.I open
or
.I visual,
the current line is initially the first line of the file.
.FE
.LC
\fBe!\fR \fIfile\fR
.ZP
The variant form suppresses the complaint about modifications having
been made and not written from the editor buffer, thus
discarding all changes which have been made before editing the new file.
.LC
\fBe\fR \fB+\fIn\fR \fIfile\fR
.ZP
Causes the editor to begin at line
.I n
rather than at the last line;
\fIn\fR may also be an editor command containing no spaces, e.g.: ``+/pat''.
.LC
\fBfile\fR	abbr: \fBf\fR
.ZP
Prints the current file name,
whether it has been `[Modified]' since the last
.I write 
command,
whether it is
.I "read only" ,
the current line,
the number of lines in the buffer,
and the percentage of the way through the buffer of the current line.*
.FS
* In the rare case that the current file is `[Not edited]' this is
noted also; in this case you have to use the form \fBw!\fR to write to
the file, since the editor is not sure that a \fBwrite\fR will not
destroy a file unrelated to the current contents of the buffer.
.FE
.LC
\fBfile\fR \fIfile\fR
.ZP
The current file name is changed to
.I file
which is considered 
`[Not edited]'.
.LC
( 1 , $ ) \fBglobal\fR /\fIpat\|\fR/ \fIcmds\fR	abbr: \fBg\fR
.ZP
First marks each line among those specified which matches
the given regular expression.
Then the given command list is executed with `\fB.\fR' initially
set to each marked line.
.IP
The command list consists of the remaining commands on the current
input line and may continue to multiple lines by ending all but the
last such line with a `\e'.
If
.I cmds
(and possibly the trailing \fB/\fR delimiter) is omitted, each line matching
.I pat
is printed.
.I Append,
.I insert,
and
.I change
commands and associated input are permitted;
the `\fB.\fR' terminating input may be omitted if it would be on the
last line of the command list.
.I Open
and
.I visual
commands are permitted in the command list and take input from the terminal.
.IP
The
.I global
command itself may not appear in
.I cmds.
The
.I undo
command is also not permitted there,
as
.I undo
instead can be used to reverse the entire
.I global
command.
The options
.I autoprint
and
.I autoindent
are inhibited during a
.I global,
(and possibly the trailing \fB/\fR delimiter) and the value of the
.I report
option is temporarily infinite,
in deference to a \fIreport\fR for the entire global.
Finally, the context mark `\'\'' is set to the value of
`.' before the global command begins and is not changed during a global
command,
except perhaps by an
.I open
or
.I visual
within the
.I global.
.LC
\fBg!\fR \fB/\fIpat\fB/\fR \fIcmds\fR	abbr: \fBv\fR

\fItext\fR
.br
\&\fB.\fR
.ZP
Places the given text before the specified line.
The current line is left at the last line input;
if there were none input it is left at the line before the addressed line.
This command differs from

.I Lhs
should be a single character, or the sequence ``#n'', for n a digit,
referring to function key \fIn\fR.  When this character or function key
is typed in
.I visual

With no arguments, prints those options whose values have been
changed from their defaults;
with parameter
.I all
it prints all of the option values.
.IP
Giving an option name followed by a `?'
causes the current value of that option to be printed.
The `?' is unnecessary unless the option is Boolean valued.
Boolean options are given values either by the form
`set \fIoption\fR' to turn them on or
`set no\fIoption\fR' to turn them off;
string and numeric options are assigned via the form
`set \fIoption\fR=value'.

On each specified line, the first instance of pattern
.I pat
is replaced by replacement pattern
.I repl.
If the
.I global
indicator option character `g'
appears, then all instances are substituted;
if the
.I confirm
indication character `c' appears,
then before each substitution the line to be substituted
is typed with the string to be substituted marked
with `\(ua' characters.
By typing an `y' one can cause the substitution to be performed,
any other input causes no change to take place.
After a
.I substitute
the current line is the last line substituted.
.IP
Lines may be split by substituting
new-line characters into them.

.IP
The tags file is normally created by a program such as
.I ctags,
and consists of a number of lines with three fields separated by blanks
or tabs.  The first field gives the name of the tag,
the second the name of the file where the tag resides, and the third
gives an addressing form which can be used by the editor to find the tag;
this field is usually a contextual scan using `/\fIpat\fR/' to be immune
to minor changes in the file.  Such scans are always performed as if
.I nomagic
was set.
.PP
The tag names in the tags file must be sorted alphabetically.

.NH 2
Regular expressions
.PP
A regular expression specifies a set of strings of characters.
A member of this set of strings is said to be
.I matched
by the regular expression.
.I Ex
remembers two previous regular expressions:
the previous regular expression used in a
.I substitute
command
and the previous regular expression used elsewhere
(referred to as the previous \fIscanning\fR regular expression.)
The previous regular expression
can always be referred to by a null \fIre\fR, e.g. `//' or `??'.
.NH 2
Magic and nomagic
.PP
The regular expressions allowed by
.I ex 
are constructed in one of two ways depending on the setting of
the
.I magic
option.
The
.I ex
and
.I vi
default setting of
.I magic
gives quick access to a powerful set of regular expression
metacharacters.
The disadvantage of
.I magic
is that the user must remember that these metacharacters are
.I magic
and precede them with the character `\e'
to use them as ``ordinary'' characters.
With
.I nomagic,
the default for
.I edit,
regular expressions are much simpler,
there being only two metacharacters.
The power of the other metacharacters is still available by preceding
the (now) ordinary character with a `\e'.
Note that `\e' is thus always a metacharacter.
.PP
The remainder of the discussion of regular expressions assumes
that
that the setting of this option is
.I magic.\(dg
.FS
\(dg To discern what is true with
.I nomagic
it suffices to remember that the only
special characters in this case will be `\(ua' at the beginning
of a regular expression,
`$' at the end of a regular expression,
and `\e'.
With
.I nomagic
the characters `\s+2~\s0' and `&' also lose their special meanings
related to the replacement pattern of a substitute.
.FE
.NH 2
Basic regular expression summary
.PP
The following basic constructs are used to construct
.I magic
mode regular expressions.
.IP \fIchar\fR 15
An ordinary character matches itself.
The characters `\(ua' at the beginning of a line,
`$' at the end of line,
`*' as any character other than the first,
`.', `\e', `[', and `\s+2~\s0' are not ordinary characters and
must be escaped (preceded) by `\e' to be treated as such.
.IP \fB\(ua\fR
At the beginning of a pattern
forces the match to succeed only at the beginning of a line.
.IP \fB$\fR
At the end of a regular expression forces the match to
succeed only at the end of the line.
.IP \&\fB.\fR
Matches any single character except
the new-line character.
.IP \fB\e<\fR
Forces the match
to occur only at the beginning of a ``variable'' or ``word'';
that is, either at the beginning of a line, or just before
a letter, digit, or underline and after a character not one of
these.
.IP \fB\e>\fR
Similar to `\e<', but matching the end of a ``variable''
or ``word'', i.e. either the end of the line or before character
which is neither a letter, nor a digit, nor the underline character.
.IP \fB[\fIstring\fR]\fR
Matches any (single) character in the class defined by
.I string.
Most characters in
.I string
define themselves.
A pair of characters separated by `\-' in
.I string
defines the set of characters collating between the specified lower and upper
bounds, thus `[a\-z]' as a regular expression matches
any (single) lower-case letter.
If the first character of
.I string
is an `\(ua' then the construct
matches those characters which it otherwise would not;
thus `[\(uaa\-z]' matches anything but a lower-case letter (and of course a
newline).
To place any of the characters
`\(ua', `[', or `\-' in
.I string
you must escape them with a preceding `\e'.
.NH 2
Combining regular expression primitives
.PP
The concatenation of two regular expressions matches the leftmost and
then longest string
which can be divided with the first piece matching the first regular
expression and the second piece matching the second.
Any of the (single character matching) regular expressions mentioned
above may be followed by the character `*' to form a regular expression
which matches any number of adjacent occurrences (including 0) of characters
matched by the regular expression it follows.
.PP
The character `\s+2~\s0' may be used in a regular expression,
and matches the text which defined the replacement part
of the last
.I substitute
command.
A regular expression may be enclosed between the sequences
`\e(' and `\e)' with side effects in the
.I substitute
replacement patterns.
.NH 2
Substitute replacement patterns
.PP
The basic metacharacters for the replacement pattern are
`&' and `~'; these are
given as `\e&' and `\e~' when
.I nomagic
is set.
Each instance of `&' is replaced by the characters
which the regular expression matched.
The metacharacter `~' stands, in the replacement pattern,
for the defining text of the previous replacement pattern.
.PP
Other metasequences possible in the replacement pattern
are always introduced by the escaping character `\e'.
The sequence `\e\fIn\fR' is replaced by the text matched
by the \fIn\fR-th regular subexpression enclosed between
`\e(' and `\e)'.\(dg
.FS
\(dg When nested, parenthesized subexpressions are present,
\fIn\fR is determined by counting occurrences of `\e(' starting from the left.
.FE
The sequences `\eu' and `\el' cause the immediately following character in
the replacement to be converted to upper- or lower-case respectively
if this character is a letter.
The sequences `\eU' and `\eL' turn such conversion on, either until
`\eE' or `\ee' is encountered, or until the end of the replacement pattern.

It then aligns the cursor at the level of indentation so determined.
.IP
If the user then types lines of text in,
they will continue to be justified at the displayed indenting level.
If more white space is typed at the beginning of a line,
the following line will start aligned with the first non-white character

Specially processed in this mode is a line with no characters added
to it, which turns into a completely blank line (the white
space provided for the

Also specially processed in this mode are lines beginning with
an `\(ua' and immediately followed by a \fB^D\fR.
This causes the input to be repositioned at the beginning of the line,

Similarly, a `0' followed by a \fB^D\fR
repositions at the beginning but without
retaining the previous indent.
.IP
.I Autoindent
doesn't happen in
.I global
commands or when the input is not a terminal.
.LC
\fBautoprint\fR, \fBap\fR	default: ap
.ZP
Causes the current line to be printed after each
.I delete ,
.I copy ,
.I join ,
.I move ,
.I substitute ,
.I t ,
.I undo
or
shift command.
This has the same effect as supplying a trailing `p'
to each such command.
.I Autoprint
is suppressed in globals,
and only applies to the last of many commands on a line.
.LC
\fBautowrite\fR, \fBaw\fR	default: noaw
.ZP
Causes the contents of the buffer to be written to the current file
if you have modified it and give a
.I next,
.I rewind,
.I stop,
.I tag,
or
.I !
command, or a \fB^\(ua\fR (switch files) or \fB^]\fR (tag goto) command
in
.I visual.
Note, that the
.I edit
and
.I ex
commands do
.B not
autowrite.
In each case, there is an equivalent way of switching when autowrite
is set to avoid the
.I autowrite
(\fIedit\fR
for
.I next ,
.I rewind!
for .I rewind ,
.I stop!
for
.I stop ,
.I tag!
for
.I tag ,
.I shell
for
.I ! ,
and
\fB:e\ #\fR and a \fB:ta!\fR command from within
.I visual).
.LC
\fBbeautify\fR, \fBbf\fR	default: nobeautify
.ZP
Causes all control characters except tab, newline and form-feed
to be discarded from the input.
A complaint is registered the first time a
backspace character is discarded.
.I Beautify
does not apply to command input.
.LC
\fBdirectory\fR, \fBdir\fR	default: dir=/tmp
.ZP
Specifies the directory in which
.I ex
places its buffer file.
If this directory in not
writable, then the editor will exit abruptly when it fails to be
able to create its buffer there.
.LC
\fBedcompatible\fR	default: noedcompatible
.ZP
Causes the presence of absence of
.B g
and
.B c
suffixes on substitute commands to be remembered, and to be toggled
by repeating the suffices.  The suffix
.B r
makes the substitution be as in the
.I ~
command, instead of like
.I &.
.LC
\fBerrorbells\fR, \fBeb\fR	default: noeb
.ZP
Error messages are preceded by a bell.*
.FS
* Bell ringing in
.I open
and
.I visual
on errors is not suppressed by setting
.I noeb.
.FE
If possible the editor always places the error message in a standout mode of the
terminal (such as inverse video) instead of ringing the bell.
.LC
\fBhardtabs\fR, \fBht\fR	default: ht=8
.ZP
Gives the boundaries on which terminal hardware tabs are set (or
on which the system expands tabs).
.LC
\fBignorecase\fR, \fBic\fR	default: noic
.ZP
All upper case characters in the text are mapped to lower case in regular
expression matching.
In addition, all upper case characters in regular expressions are mapped
to lower case except in character class specifications.
.LC
\fBlisp\fR	default: nolisp
.ZP
\fIAutoindent\fR indents appropriately for
.I lisp
code, and the \fB( ) { } [[\fR and \fB]]\fR commands in
.I open
and
.I visual
are modified to have meaning for \fIlisp\fR.
.LC
\fBlist\fR	default: nolist
.ZP
All printed lines will be displayed (more) unambiguously,
showing tabs and end-of-lines as in the
.I list
command.
.LC
\fBmagic\fR	default: magic for \fIex\fR and \fIvi\fR\(dg
.FS
\(dg \fINomagic\fR for \fIedit\fR.
.FE
.ZP
If
.I nomagic
is set, the number of regular expression metacharacters is greatly reduced,
with only `\(ua' and `$' having special effects.
In addition the metacharacters
`~'
and
`&'
of the replacement pattern are treated as normal characters.
All the normal metacharacters may be made
.I magic
when
.I nomagic
is set by preceding them with a `\e'.
.LC
\fBmesg\fR	default: mesg
.ZP
Causes write permission to be turned off to the terminal
while you are in visual mode, if
.I nomesg
is set.
.LC
\fBmodeline\fR	default: nomodeline
.ZP
If
.I modeline
is set, then the first 5 lines and the last five lines of the file
will be checked for ex command lines and the comands issued.
To be recognized as a command line, the line must have the string
.B ex:
or
.B vi:
preceeded by a tab or a space.  This string may be anywhere in the
line and anything after the 
.I :
is interpeted as editor commands.  This option defaults to off because
of unexpected behavior when editting files such as
.I /etc/passwd.
.LC
\fBnumber, nu\fR	default: nonumber
.ZP
Causes all output lines to be printed with their
line numbers.
In addition each input line will be prompted for by supplying the line number
it will have.
.LC
\fBopen\fR	default: open
.ZP
If \fInoopen\fR, the commands
.I open
and
.I visual
are not permitted.
This is set for
.I edit
to prevent confusion resulting from accidental entry to 
open or visual mode.
.LC
\fBoptimize, opt\fR	default: optimize
.ZP
Throughput of text is expedited by setting the terminal
to not do automatic carriage returns
when printing more than one (logical) line of output,
greatly speeding output on terminals without addressable
cursors when text with leading white space is printed.
.LC
\fBparagraphs,\ para\fR	default: para=IPLPPPQPP\0LIbp
.ZP
Specifies the paragraphs for the \fB{\fR and \fB}\fR operations in
.I open
and 
.I visual.
The pairs of characters in the option's value are the names
of the macros which start paragraphs.
.LC
\fBprompt\fR	default: prompt
.ZP
Command mode input is prompted for with a `:'.
.LC
\fBredraw\fR	default: noredraw
.ZP
The editor simulates (using great amounts of output), an intelligent
terminal on a dumb terminal (e.g. during insertions in
.I visual
the characters to the right of the cursor position are refreshed
as each input character is typed.)
Useful only at very high speed.
.LC
\fBremap\fP	default: remap
.ZP
If on, macros are repeatedly tried until they are unchanged.
For example, if
.B o
is mapped to
.B O ,
and
.B O
is mapped to
.B I ,
then if
.I remap
is set,
.B o
will map to
.B I ,
but if
.I noremap
is set, it will map to
.B O .
.LC
\fBreport\fR	default: report=5\(dg
.FS
\(dg 2 for \fIedit\fR.
.FE
.ZP
Specifies a threshold for feedback from commands.
Any command which modifies more than the specified number of lines
will provide feedback as to the scope of its changes.
For commands such as
.I global ,
.I open ,
.I undo ,
and
.I visual
which have potentially more far reaching scope,
the net change in the number of lines in the buffer is
presented at the end of the command, subject to this same threshold.
Thus notification is suppressed during a
.I global
command on the individual commands performed.
.LC
\fBscroll\fR	default: scroll=\(12 window
.ZP
Determines the number of logical lines scrolled when an end-of-file
is received from a terminal input in command mode,
and the number of lines printed by a command mode
.I z
command (double the value of
.I scroll ).
.LC
\fBsections\fR	default: sections=SHNHH\0HU
.ZP
Specifies the section macros for the \fB[[\fR and \fB]]\fR operations
in
.I open
and
.I visual.
The pairs of characters in the options's value are the names
of the macros which start paragraphs.
.LC
\fBshell\fR, \fBsh\fR	default: sh=/bin/sh
.ZP
Gives the path name of the shell forked for 
the shell escape command `!', and by the
.I shell
command.
The default is taken from SHELL in the environment, if present.
.LC
\fBshiftwidth\fR, \fBsw\fR	default: sw=8
.ZP
Gives the width a software tab stop,
used in reverse tabbing with \fB^D\fR when using
.I autoindent
to append text,
and by the shift commands.
.LC
\fBshowmatch, sm\fR	default: nosm
.ZP
In
.I open
and
.I visual
mode, when a \fB)\fR or \fB}\fR is typed, move the cursor to the matching
\fB(\fR or \fB{\fR for one second if this matching character is on the
screen.  Extremely useful with
.I lisp.
.LC
\fBslowopen, slow\fR	terminal dependent
.ZP
Affects the display algorithm used in
.I visual
mode, holding off display updating during input of new text to improve
throughput when the terminal in use is both slow and unintelligent.
See
.I "An Introduction to Display Editing with Vi"
for more details.
.LC
\fBtabstop,\ ts\fR	default: ts=8
.ZP
The editor expands tabs in the input file to be on
.I tabstop
boundaries for the purposes of display.
.LC
\fBtaglength,\ tl\fR	default: tl=0
.ZP
Tags are not significant beyond this many characters.
A value of zero (the default) means that all characters are significant.
.LC
\fBtags\fR	default: tags=tags /usr/lib/tags
.ZP
A path of files to be used as tag files for the
.I tag
command.
A requested tag is searched for in the specified files, sequentially.
By default, files called
.B tags
are searched for in the current directory and in /usr/lib
(a master file for the entire system).
.LC
\fBterm\fR	from environment TERM
.ZP
The terminal type of the output device.
.LC
\fBterse\fR	default: noterse
.ZP
Shorter error diagnostics are produced for the experienced user.
.LC
\fBwarn\fR	default: warn
.ZP
Warn if there has been `[No write since last change]' before a `!'
command escape.
.LC
\fBwindow\fR	default: window=speed dependent
.ZP
The number of lines in a text window in the
.I visual
command.
The default is 8 at slow speeds (600 baud or less),
16 at medium speed (1200 baud),
and the full screen (minus one line) at higher speeds.
.LC
\fBw300,\ w1200\, w9600\fR
.ZP
These are not true options but set
.B window
only if the speed is slow (300), medium (1200), or high (9600),
respectively.
They are suitable for an EXINIT
and make it easy to change the 8/16/full screen rule.
.LC
\fBwrapscan\fR, \fBws\fR	default: ws
.ZP
Searches using the regular expressions in addressing
will wrap around past the end of the file.
.LC
\fBwrapmargin\fR, \fBwm\fR	default: wm=0
.ZP
Defines a margin for automatic wrapover of text during input in
.I open
and
.I visual
modes.  See
.I "An Introduction to Text Editing with Vi"
for details.
.LC
\fBwriteany\fR, \fBwa\fR	default: nowa
.IP
Inhibit the checks normally made before
.I write
commands, allowing a write to any file which the system protection
mechanism will allow.
