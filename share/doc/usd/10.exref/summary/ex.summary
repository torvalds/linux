Ex/Edit Command Summary (Version 2.0)
.sp 1
.ft R
.nr VS 11
.nr PS 9
.2C
.PP
.I Ex
and
.I edit
are text editors, used for creating
and modifying files of text on the \*U
computer system.
.I Edit
is a variant of
.I ex
with features designed to
make it less complicated
to learn and use.
In terms of command syntax and effect
the editors are essentially identical,
and this command summary applies to both.
.PP
The summary is meant as a quick reference
for users already acquainted
with
.I edit
or \fIex\fP.
Fuller explanations of the editors are available
in the documents
.I
Edit: A Tutorial
.R
(a self-teaching introduction) and the
.I
Ex Reference Manual
.R
(the comprehensive reference source for
both \fIedit\fP and \fIex\fP).
Both of these writeups are available in the
Computing Services Library.
.PP
In the examples included with the
summary, commands and text entered by
the user are printed in \fBboldface\fR to
distinguish them from responses printed
by the computer.
.sp 0.45v
.LP
.B
The Editor Buffer
.PP
In order to perform its tasks
the editor sets aside a temporary
work space,
called a \fIbuffer\fR,
separate from the user's permanent
file.
Before starting to work on an existing
file the editor makes a copy of it in the
buffer, leaving the original untouched.
All editing changes are made to the
buffer copy, which must then
be written back to the permanent
file in order to update the
old version.
The buffer disappears
at the end of the editing session.
.sp 0.45v
.LP
.B
Editing: Command and Text Input Modes
.PP
.R
During an editing session there are
two usual modes of operation:
\fIcommand\fP mode and \fItext input\fP
mode.
(This disregards, for the moment,
.I open
and
.I visual
modes, discussed below.)
In command mode, the editor issues a
colon prompt (:)
to show that it is ready to
accept and execute a command.
In text input mode, on the other hand, there is
no prompt and the editor merely accepts text to
be added to the buffer.
Text input mode is initiated by the commands
\fIappend\fP, \fIinsert\fP, and \fIchange\fP,
and is terminated by typing a period as the
first and only character on a line.
.sp 0.45v
.LP
.B
Line Numbers and Command Syntax
.PP
.R
The editor keeps track of lines of text
in the buffer by numbering them consecutively
starting with 1 and renumbering
as lines are added or deleted.
At any given time the editor is positioned
at one of these lines; this position is
called the \fIcurrent line\fP.
Generally, commands that change the
contents of the buffer print the
new current line at the end of their
execution.
.PP
Most commands can be preceded by one or two
line-number addresses which indicate the lines
to be affected.
If one number is given the command operates on
that line only; if two, on an inclusive range
of lines.
Commands that can take line-number prefixes also
assume default prefixes if none are given.
The default assumed by each command is designed
to make it convenient to use in many instances
without any line-number prefix.
For the most part, a command used without a
prefix operates on the current line,
though exceptions to this rule should be noted.
The \fIprint\fP command
by itself, for instance, causes
one line, the current line, to be
printed at the terminal.
.PP
The summary shows the number of line addresses
that can be
prefixed to each command as well as
the defaults assumed if they are omitted.
For example,
.I (.,.)
means that up to 2 line-numbers may be given,
and that if none is given the
command operates on the current line.
(In the address prefix notation, ``.'' stands
for the current line and ``$'' stands for
the last line of the buffer.)
If no such notation appears, no
line-number prefix may be used.
.PP
Some commands take trailing
information;
only
the more important instances of this
are mentioned in the summary.
.sp 0.25v
.LP
.B
Open and Visual Modes
.PP
.R
Besides command and text input modes,
.I ex
and
.I edit
provide on some CRT terminals other modes of editing,
.I open
and
.I visual .
In these modes the cursor can
be moved to individual words
or characters in a line.
The commands then given are very different
from the standard editor commands; most do not appear on the screen when
typed.
.I
An Introduction to Display Editing with Vi
.R
provides a full discussion.
.sp 0.25v
.LP
.B
Special Characters
.PP
.R
.fi
Some characters take on special meanings
when used in context searches
and in patterns given to the \fIsubstitute\fP command.
For \fIedit\fR, these are ``^'' and ``$'',
meaning the beginning and end of a line,
respectively.
.I Ex
has the following additional special characters:
.B
.ce 1
\&.     &     *     [     ]     ~
.R
To use one of the special characters as its
simple graphic representation
rather than with its special meaning,
precede it by a backslash (\\).
The backslash always has a special meaning.
