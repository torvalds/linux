NOTE: This document in its current form describes the \fItroff\fP\| program
supplied with 4.4BSD.  The \fIgroff\fP\| program supplied with FreeBSD has a

Introduction
.pg
\*(NR and \*(TR are text processors under
the \s-1UNIX\s+1 Time-Sharing System
that format text for typewriter-like terminals and
for a \%Graphic Systems phototypesetter, respectively.
(Device-independent \*(TR, part of the Documenter's Workbench,
supports additional output devices.)
They accept lines of text interspersed with lines of
format control information and
format the text into a printable, paginated document
having a user-designed style.
\*(NR and \*(TR offer
unusual freedom in document styling,
including:
arbitrary style headers and footers;
arbitrary style footnotes;
multiple automatic sequence numbering for paragraphs, sections, etc;
multiple column output;
dynamic font and point-size control;
arbitrary horizontal and vertical local motions at any point;
and
a family of automatic overstriking, bracket construction, and
line drawing functions.
.pg
\*(NR and \*(TR are highly compatible with each other and it is almost always
possible to prepare input acceptable to both.
Conditional input is provided that enables
the user to embed input expressly destined for either program.
\*(NR can prepare output directly for a variety of terminal types and
is capable of utilizing the full resolution of each terminal.
.pg
.ft B
Usage
.pg
The general form of invoking \*(NR (or \*(TR) at \s-1UNIX\s+1 command level is
.x1
\fBnroff  \fIoptions  files\fR\
\h'|2i'(or  \fBtroff  \fIoptions  files\fR)
.x2
where \fIoptions\fR represents any of a number of option arguments
and \fIfiles\fR represents the list of files containing the document
to be formatted.
An argument consisting of a single minus (\fB\-\fR) is taken to be
a file name corresponding to the standard input.
If no file names are given input is taken from the standard input.
The options, which may appear in any order so long as they appear
before the files, are:
.sp
.ta .2i 1.0i
.ft I
.bd I 3
	Option	Effect
.br
.bd I
.ft R
.ta .3i 1.0i
.in 1.0i
.ll -.3i
.bt
	\fB\-i\fP	Read standard input after the input files are exhausted.
.bt
	\fB\-m\fIname\fR	Prepends the macro file
\fB\(slusr\(sllib\(sltmac.\fIname\fR
to the input \fIfiles\fR.
.bt
	\fB\-n\fIN\fR	Number first generated page \fIN\fR.
.bt
	\fB\-o\fIlist\fR	\
Print only pages whose page numbers appear in \fIlist\fR,
which consists of comma-separated numbers and number ranges.
A number range has the form \fIN\-M\fR
and means pages \fIN\fR through \fIM;\fR
a initial \fI\-N\fR means
from the beginning to page \fIN;\fR and a final \fIN\-\fR means
from \fIN\fR to the end.
.bt
	\fB\-q\fR	\
Invoke the simultaneous input-output mode of the \fBrd\fR request.
.bt
	\fB\-r\fIaN\fR	Number register \fIa\fR (one-character) is set to \fIN\fR.
.bt
	\fB\-s\fIN\fR	Stop every \fIN\fR pages.
\*(NR will halt prior to every \fIN\fR pages (default \fIN\fR=1)
to allow paper loading or
changing, and will resume upon receipt of a newline.
\*(TR will stop the phototypesetter every \fIN\fR pages,
produce a trailer to allow changing cassettes,
and will resume after the phototypesetter \s-1START\s+1 button is pressed.
.bt
	\fB\-z\fR	Efficiently suppress formatted output.
Only produce output to standard error (from \fBtm\fP requests or
diagnostics).
.sp
.ne 5
.ft I
.bd I 3
		\*(NR Only
.br
.bd I
.ft
.bt
	\fB\-T\fIname\fR	Specifies
the name of the output terminal type.
Currently defined names are \fB37\fR for the (default) Model 37 Teletype\(rg,
\fBtn300\fR for the GE TermiNet\ 300 (or any terminal without half-line
capabilities),
\fB300S\fR for the \s-1DASI\s+1-300S,
\fB300\fR for the \s-1DASI\s+1-300,
and
\fB450\fR for the \s-1DASI\s+1-450 (Diablo Hyterm).
.bt
	\fB\-e\fR	\
Produce equally-spaced words in adjusted
lines, using full terminal resolution.
.bt
	\fB\-h\fR	\
On output, use tabs during horizontal spacing to increase speed.
Device tabs setting are assumed to be (and input tabs are initially 
set to) every 8 character widths.
.sp
.ne 3
.ft I
.bd I 3
		\*(TR Only
.br
.bd I
.ft
.bt
	\fB\-a\fP	Send a printable \s-1(ASCII)\s+1 approximation
of the results to the standard output.
.bt
	\fB\-b\fR	\*(TR will report whether the phototypesetter
is busy or available.
No text processing is done.
.bt
	\fB\-f\fP	Refrain from feeding out paper and stopping
phototypesetter at the end of the run.
.bt
	\fB\-t\fP	Direct output to the standard output instead
of the phototypesetter.
.bt
	\fB\-w\fP	Wait until phototypesetter is available, if
currently busy.

Each option is invoked as a separate argument;
for example,
.x1
\fBnroff  \-o\fI4,8\-10  \fB\-T\fI300S  \fB\-m\fIabc  file1  file2\fR
.x2
requests formatting of pages 4, 8, 9, and 10 of a document contained in the files
named \fIfile1\fR and \fIfile2\fR,
specifies the output terminal as a \s-1DASI\s+1-300S,
and invokes the macro package \fIabc\fR.
.pg
Various pre- and post-processors are available for use with \*(NR and \*(TR.
These include the equation preprocessors \s-1NEQN\s+1 and \s-1EQN\s+1\*u1\*d
(for \*(NR and \*(TR respectively),
and the table-construction preprocessor \s-1TBL\s+1\*u2\*d.
A reverse-line postprocessor \s-1COL\s+1\*u3\*d
is available for multiple-column \*(NR output on terminals without reverse-line ability;
\s-1COL\s+1 expects the Model 37 Teletype
escape sequences that \*(NR produces by default.
\s-1TK\s+1\*u3\*d
is a 37 Teletype simulator postprocessor for printing \*(NR output on a Tektronix 4014.
\s-1TC\s+1\*u5\*d
is a phototypesetter-simulator postprocessor
for \*(TR that produces an approximation of phototypesetter output
on a Tektronix 4014.
For example, in
.x1
\fBtbl  \fIfiles  \fB|  eqn  |  troff  \-t \fIoptions  \fB|  tc\fR
.x2
the first \|\fB|\fR\| indicates the piping of \s-1TBL\s+1's output to \s-1EQN\s+1's input;
the second the piping of \s-1EQN\s+1's output to \*(TR's input;
and the third indicates the piping of \*(TR's output to \s-1TC\s+1.
