 * This little script is for use with programs that use event loop and should
 * sleep only when waiting for events (eg. via kevent(2)). When a program is
 * going to sleep in the kernel, the script will show its name, PID, kernel
 * stack trace and userland stack trace. Sleeping in kevent(2) is ignored.
 *
 * usage: blocking <execname>
