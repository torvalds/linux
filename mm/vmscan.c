		 *    caller can stall after page list has been processed.
		 *
		 * 2) Global or new memcg reclaim encounters a page that is
		 *    not marked for immediate reclaim or the caller does not
		 *    have __GFP_IO. In this case mark the page for immediate
		 *    reclaim and continue scanning.
		 *
		 *    __GFP_IO is checked  because a loop driver thread might
		 *    enter reclaim, and deadlock if it waits on a page for
		 *    which it is needed to do the write (loop masks off
		 *    __GFP_IO|__GFP_FS for this reason); but more thought
		 *    would probably show more reasons.
		 *
		 *    Don't require __GFP_FS, since we're not going into the
		 *    FS, just waiting on its writeback completion. Worryingly,
		 *    ext4 gfs2 and xfs allocate pages with
		 *    grab_cache_page_write_begin(,,AOP_FLAG_NOFS), so testing
		 *    may_enter_fs here is liable to OOM on them.
		 *
		 * 3) Legacy memcg encounters a page that is not already marked
		 *    PageReclaim. memcg does not have any dirty pages
		 *    throttling so we could easily OOM just because too many
		 *    pages are in writeback and there is nothing else to
