	  The NOMMU mmap() frequently needs to allocate large contiguous chunks
	  of memory on which to store mappings, but it can only ask the system
	  allocator for chunks in 2^N*PAGE_SIZE amounts - which is frequently
	  more than it requires.  To deal with this, mmap() is able to trim off
	  the excess and return it to the allocator.

	  If trimming is enabled, the excess is trimmed off and returned to the
	  system allocator, which can cause extra fragmentation, particularly
	  if there are a lot of transient processes.

	  If trimming is disabled, the excess is kept, but not used, which for
	  long-term mappings means that the space is wasted.

	  Trimming can be dynamically controlled through a sysctl option
	  (/proc/sys/vm/nr_trim_pages) which specifies the minimum number of
	  excess pages there must be before trimming should occur, or zero if
	  no trimming is to occur.

	  This option specifies the initial value of this option.  The default

	  Cleancache can be thought of as a page-granularity victim cache
	  for clean pages that the kernel's pageframe replacement algorithm
	  (PFRA) would like to keep around, but can't since there isn't enough
	  memory.  So when the PFRA "evicts" a page, it first attempts to use
	  cleancache code to put the data contained in that page into
	  "transcendent memory", memory that is not directly accessible or
	  addressable by the kernel and is of unknown and possibly
	  time-varying size.  And when a cleancache-enabled
	  filesystem wishes to access a page in a file on disk, it first
	  checks cleancache to see if it already contains it; if it does,
	  the page is copied into the kernel and a disk access is avoided.
	  When a transcendent memory driver is available (such as zcache or
	  Xen transcendent memory), a significant I/O reduction
	  may be achieved.  When none is available, all cleancache calls

	  time-varying size.  When space in transcendent memory is available,
	  a significant swap I/O reduction may be achieved.  When none is
	  available, all frontswap calls are reduced to a single pointer-

	help
	  This feature allows to estimate the amount of user pages that have
	  not been touched during a given period of time. This information can
	  be useful to tune memory cgroup limits and/or for job placement
	  within a compute cluster.

	  See Documentation/admin-guide/mm/idle_page_tracking.rst for
	  more details.

	help
	  Device memory hotplug support allows for establishing pmem,
	  or other device driver discovered memory regions, in the
	  memmap. This allows pfn_to_page() lookups of otherwise
	  "device-physical" addresses which is needed for using a DAX
	  mapping in an O_DIRECT operation, among other things.

	  If FS_DAX is enabled, then say Y.

	  Allows creation of struct pages to represent unaddressable device
	  memory; i.e., memory that is only accessible from the device (or
	  group of devices). You likely also want to select HMM_MIRROR.

config PERCPU_STATS
	bool "Collect percpu memory statistics"
	help
	  This feature collects and exposes statistics via debugfs. The
	  information includes global and per chunk statistics, which can
	  be used to help understand percpu memory usage.

config GUP_TEST
	bool "Enable infrastructure for get_user_pages()-related unit tests"
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Provides /sys/kernel/debug/gup_test, which in turn provides a way
	  to make ioctl calls that can launch kernel-based unit tests for
	  the get_user_pages*() and pin_user_pages*() family of API calls.

	  These tests include benchmark testing of the _fast variants of
	  get_user_pages*() and pin_user_pages*(), as well as smoke tests of
	  the non-_fast variants.

	  There is also a sub-test that allows running dump_page() on any
	  of up to eight pages (selected by command line args) within the
	  range of user-space addresses. These pages are either pinned via
	  pin_user_pages*(), or pinned via get_user_pages*(), as specified
	  by other command line arguments.

	  See tools/testing/selftests/vm/gup_test.c
