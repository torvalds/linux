	  Randomization of the page allocator improves the average
	  utilization of a direct-mapped memory-side-cache. See section
	  5.2.27 Heterogeneous Memory Attribute Table (HMAT) in the ACPI
	  6.2a specification for an example of how a platform advertises

	  default granularity of shuffling on the "MAX_ORDER - 1" i.e,
	  10th order of pages is selected based on cache utilization
	  benefits on x86.

	  While the randomization improves cache utilization it may
	  negatively impact workloads on platforms without a cache. For
	  this reason, by default, the randomization is enabled only
	  after runtime detection of a direct-mapped memory-side-cache.

	  ELF-FDPIC binfmt's brk and stack allocator.

	  Because of the obvious security issues, this option should only be
	  enabled on embedded devices where you control what is run in

	  This enables the Contiguous Memory Allocator which allows other
