	  This option allows you to change some of the ways that
	  Linux manages its memory internally.  Most users will
	  only have one option here: FLATMEM.  This is normal
	  and a correct option.

	  Some users of more advanced features like NUMA and
	  memory hotplug may have different options here.
	  DISCONTIGMEM is an more mature, better tested system,
	  but is incompatible with memory hotplug and may suffer
	  decreased performance over SPARSEMEM.  If unsure between
	  "Sparse Memory" and "Discontiguous Memory", choose
	  "Discontiguous Memory".

	  If unsure, choose this option (Flat Memory) over any other.

config DISCONTIGMEM_MANUAL
	bool "Discontiguous Memory"
	depends on ARCH_DISCONTIGMEM_ENABLE
	help
	  This option provides enhanced support for discontiguous
	  memory systems, over FLATMEM.  These systems have holes
	  in their physical address spaces, and this option provides
	  more efficient handling of these holes.  However, the vast
	  majority of hardware has quite flat address spaces, and
	  can have degraded performance from extra overhead that
	  this option imposes.

	  Many NUMA configurations will have this as the only option.

	  If unsure, choose "Flat Memory" over this option.

config SPARSEMEM_MANUAL
	bool "Sparse Memory"
	depends on ARCH_SPARSEMEM_ENABLE
	help
	  This will be the only option for some systems, including
	  memory hotplug systems.  This is normal.

	  For many other systems, this will be an alternative to
	  "Discontiguous Memory".  This option provides some potential
	  performance benefits, along with decreased code complexity,
	  but it is newer, and more experimental.

	  If unsure, choose "Discontiguous Memory" or "Flat Memory"
	  over this option.
