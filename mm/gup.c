 *
 * Returns number of pages pinned. This may be fewer than the number

 * with a put_page() call when it is finished with. vmas will only
 * remain valid while mmap_sem is held.
 *
 * Must be called with mmap_sem held.  It may be released.  See below.
 *
 * __get_user_pages walks a process's page tables and takes a reference to
 * each struct page that each user address corresponds to at a given
 * instant. That is, it takes the page that would be accessed if a user
 * thread accesses the given user virtual address at that instant.
 *
 * This does not guarantee that the page exists in the user mappings when

 * page there in some cases (eg. if mmapped pagecache has been invalidated
 * and subsequently re faulted). However it does guarantee that the page
 * won't be freed completely. And mostly callers simply care that the page
 * contains data that was valid *at some point in time*. Typically, an IO
 * or similar operation cannot guarantee anything stronger anyway because
 * locks can't be held over the syscall boundary.
 *
 * If @gup_flags & FOLL_WRITE == 0, the page must not be written to. If
 * the page is written to, set_page_dirty (or set_page_dirty_lock, as
 * appropriate) must be called after the page is finished with, and
 * before put_page is called.
 *
 * If @nonblocking != NULL, __get_user_pages will not wait for disk IO
 * or mmap_sem contention, and if waiting is needed to pin all pages,
 * *@nonblocking will be set to 0.  Further, if @gup_flags does not
 * include FOLL_NOWAIT, the mmap_sem will be released via up_read() in
 * this case.
 *
 * A caller using such a combination of @nonblocking and @gup_flags
 * must therefore hold the mmap_sem for reading only, and recognize
 * when it's been released.  Otherwise, it must be held for either
 * reading or writing and will not be released.
 *
 * In most cases, get_user_pages or get_user_pages_fast should be used
 * instead of __get_user_pages. __get_user_pages should be used only if

 *
 * Another way to achieve this is to batch up page table containing pages
 * belonging to more than one mm_user, then rcu_sched a callback to free those
 * pages. Disabling interrupts will allow the fast_gup walker to both block
 * the rcu_sched callback, and an IPI that we broadcast for splitting THPs
 * (which is a relatively rare event). The code below adopts this strategy.
 *
 * Before activating this code, please be aware that the following assumptions
 * are currently made:
 *
 *  *) HAVE_RCU_TABLE_FREE is enabled, and tlb_remove_table is used to free
 *      pages containing page tables.
 *
 *  *) THP splits will broadcast an IPI, this can be achieved by overriding
 *      pmdp_splitting_flush.
 *
 *  *) ptes can be read atomically by the architecture.
 *
 *  *) access_ok is sufficient to validate userspace address ranges.
 *
 * The last two assumptions can be relaxed by the addition of helper functions.
 *
 * This code is based heavily on the PowerPC implementation by Nick Piggin.
