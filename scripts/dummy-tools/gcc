# Staring v4.18, Kconfig evaluates compiler capabilities, and hides CONFIG
# options your compiler does not support. This works well if you configure and
# build the kernel on the same host machine.
#
# It is inconvenient if you prepare the .config that is carried to a different
# build environment (typically this happens when you package the kernel for
# distros) because using a different compiler potentially produces different
# CONFIG options than the real build environment. So, you probably want to make
# as many options visible as possible. In other words, you need to create a
# super-set of CONFIG options that cover any build environment. If some of the
# CONFIG options turned out to be unsupported on the build machine, they are
# automatically disabled by the nature of Kconfig.
#
# However, it is not feasible to get a full-featured compiler for every arch.
# Hence these dummy toolchains to make all compiler tests pass.
#
# Usage:
#
# From the top directory of the source tree, run
#
#   $ make CROSS_COMPILE=scripts/dummy-tools/ oldconfig
#
# Most of compiler features are tested by cc-option, which simply checks the
# exit code of $(CC). This script does nothing and just exits with 0 in most
# cases. So, $(cc-option, ...) is evaluated as 'y'.
#
# This scripts caters to more checks; handle --version and pre-process __GNUC__
# etc. to pretend to be GCC, and also do right things to satisfy some scripts.

# Check if the first parameter appears in the rest. Succeeds if found.
# This helper is useful if a particular option was passed to this script.
# Typically used like this:
#   arg_contain <word-you-are-searching-for> "$@"
arg_contain ()
