# Head objects
#
# The objects listed here are placed at the head of vmlinux. A typical use-case
# is an object that contains the entry point. This is kept for compatibility
# with head-y, which Kbuild used to support.
#
# A counter approach is to control the section placement by the linker script.
# The code marked as __HEAD goes into the ".head.text" section, which is placed
# before the normal ".text" section.
#
# If you can achieve the correct code ordering by linker script, please delete
# the entry from this file.
