# The source tarball, which is generated by 'git archive', contains everything
# you committed in the repository. If you have local diff ('git diff HEAD'),
# it will go into ${diff_patch}. If untracked files are remaining, the resulting
# source package may not be correct.
#
# Examples:
#  - You modified a source file to add #include "new-header.h"
#    but forgot to add new-header.h
#  - You modified a Makefile to add 'obj-$(CONFIG_FOO) += new-dirver.o'
#    but you forgot to add new-driver.c
#
# You need to commit them, or at least stage them by 'git add'.
#
# This script does not take care of untracked files because doing so would
# introduce additional complexity. Instead, print a warning message here if
# untracked files are found.
# If all untracked files are just garbage, you can ignore this warning.
