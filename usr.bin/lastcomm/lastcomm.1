.Sh NAME
.Nm lastcomm
.Nd show last commands executed
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl EScesu
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Cm + Ns Ar format
.Op Ar command ...\&
.Op Ar user ...\&
.Op Ar terminal ...\&
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility gives information on previously executed commands.
With no arguments,
.Nm
prints information about all the commands recorded
during the current accounting file's lifetime.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl E
Print the time the process exited.
.It Fl S
Print the time the process started.
.It Fl c
Print the amount of cpu time used by the process.
.It Fl e
Print the amount of elapsed time used by the process.
.It Fl s
Print the amount of system time used by the process.
.It Fl u
Print the amount of user time used by the process.
.It Fl f Ar file
Read from
.Ar file
rather than the default
.Pa /var/account/acct .
If
.Ar file
is a single dash
.Pq Sq \&-
.Nm
reads accounting entries from the standard input.
.El
.Pp
An operand with a leading plus sign
.Pq Sq +
is followed a user-defined format string which specifies the format
in which to display the process's start or exit date and time.
The format string may contain any of the conversion specifications
described in the
.Xr strftime 3
manual page, as well as arbitrary text.
.Pp
If no options are specified,
.Fl cS
is assumed.
If
.Nm
is invoked with arguments, only accounting entries with a
matching
.Ar command
name,
.Ar user
name,
or
.Ar terminal
name
are printed.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl lastcomm a.out root ttyd0
.Pp
would produce a listing of all the
executions of commands named
.Pa a.out
by user
.Ar root
on the terminal
.Ar ttyd0 .
.Pp
For each process entry, the following are printed.
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
The name of the user who ran the process.
.It
Flags, as accumulated by the accounting facilities in the system.
.It
The command name under which the process was called.
.It
The amount of
CPU
.Pq Fl c ,
wall
.Pq Fl e ,
system
.Pq Fl s ,
or user
.Pq Fl u
time used by the process (in seconds).
.It
The time the process started
.Pq Fl S
or exited
.Pq Fl E .
.El
.Pp
The flags are encoded as follows: ``S'' indicates the command was
executed by the super-user, ``F'' indicates the command ran after
a fork, but without a following
.Xr exec 3 ,
.\" ``C'' indicates the command was run in PDP-11 compatibility mode
.\" (VAX only),
``D'' indicates the command terminated with the generation of a
.Pa core
file, and ``X'' indicates the command was terminated with a signal.
.Pp
By default, accounting entries are printed going backwards in time,
starting from the time
.Nm
was executed.
However, if
.Nm
reads entries from its standard input, then entries are printed in
the order they are read.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/account/acct -compact
.It Pa /var/account/acct
default accounting file
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command
.Dl lastcomm -Ee
will print the exit time and elapsed time of each command logged in
.Pa /var/account/acct ,
while
.Dl tail -f -c 0 /var/account/acct | lastcomm -f -
will print details of each terminating command.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr core 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
