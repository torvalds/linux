.Sh BUGS
Several
.Tn ASCII
characters are not defined, notably <, >, [, ], \\,
^, _, {, }, |, and ~.
Also, the characters ", ', and & are funny looking (but in a useful way.)
.Pp
The
.Fl w
option is implemented by skipping some rows and columns.
The smaller it gets, the grainier the output.
Sometimes it runs letters together.
.Pp
Messages are limited to 1024 characters in length.
