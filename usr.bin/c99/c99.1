.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is the name of the C language compiler as required by the
.St -p1003.1-2001
standard.
.Pp
The
.Nm
compiler accepts the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Suppress the link-edit phase of the compilation, and do not remove any
object files that are produced.
.It Fl D Ar name Ns Op = Ns Ar value
Define name as if by a C-language
.Ic #define
directive.
If no
.Dq = Ns Ar value
is given, a value of 1 will be used.
Note that in order to request a
translation as specified by
.St -p1003.1-2001 ,
you need to define
.Dv _POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L
either in the source or using this option.
The
.Fl D
option has lower precedence than the
.Fl U
option.
That is, if
.Ar name
is used in both a
.Fl U
and a
.Fl D
option,
.Ar name
will be undefined regardless of the order of the options.
The
.Fl D
option may be specified more than once.
.It Fl E
Copy C-language source files to the standard output, expanding all
preprocessor directives; no compilation will be performed.
.It Fl g
Produce symbolic information in the object or executable files.
.It Fl I Ar directory
Change the algorithm for searching for headers whose names are not
absolute pathnames to look in the directory named by the
.Ar directory
pathname before looking in the usual places.
Thus, headers whose
names are enclosed in double-quotes
.Pq Qq
will be searched for first
in the directory of the file with the
.Ic #include
line, then in
directories named in
.Fl I
options, and last in the usual places.
For headers whose names are enclosed in angle brackets
.Pq Aq ,
the header
will be searched for only in directories named in
.Fl I
options and then in the usual places.
Directories named in
.Fl I
options shall be searched in the order specified.
The
.Fl I
option may be specified more than once.
.It Fl L Ar directory
Change the algorithm of searching for the libraries named in the
.Fl l
objects to look in the directory named by the
.Ar directory
pathname before looking in the usual places.
Directories named in
.Fl L
options will be searched in the order specified.
The
.Fl L
option may be specified more than once.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
Use the pathname
.Ar outfile ,
instead of the default
.Pa a.out ,
for the executable file produced.
.It Fl O Ar optlevel
If
.Ar optlevel
is zero, disable all optimizations.
Otherwise, enable optimizations at the specified level.
.It Fl s
Produce object and/or executable files from which symbolic and other
information not required for proper execution has been removed
(stripped).
.It Fl U Ar name
Remove any initial definition of
.Ar name .
The
.Fl U
option may be specified more than once.
.El
.Pp
An operand is either in the form of a pathname or the form
.Fl l
library.
At least one operand of the pathname form needs to be specified.
Supported operands are of the form:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width ".Fl l Ar library"
.It Ar file Ns Pa .c
A C-language source file to be compiled and optionally linked.
The operand must be of this form if the
.Fl c
option is used.
.It Ar file Ns Pa .a
A library of object files, as produced by
.Xr ar 1 ,
passed directly to the link editor.
.It Ar file Ns Pa .o
An object file produced by
.Nm Fl c ,
and passed directly to the link editor.
.It Fl l Ar library
Search the library named
.Pa lib Ns Ar library Ns Pa .a .
A library will be searched when its name is encountered, so the
placement of a
.Fl l
operand is significant.
