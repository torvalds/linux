.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBllvm\-bcanalyzer\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIfilename\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBllvm\-bcanalyzer\fP command is a small utility for analyzing bitcode
files.  The tool reads a bitcode file (such as generated with the
\fBllvm\-as\fP tool) and produces a statistical report on the contents of
the bitcode file.  The tool can also dump a low level but human readable
version of the bitcode file.  This tool is probably not of much interest or
utility except for those working directly with the bitcode file format.  Most
LLVM users can just ignore this tool.
.sp
If \fIfilename\fP is omitted or is \fB\-\fP, then \fBllvm\-bcanalyzer\fP reads its
input from standard input.  This is useful for combining the tool into a
pipeline.  Output is written to the standard output.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-nodetails
Causes \fBllvm\-bcanalyzer\fP to abbreviate its output by writing out only
a module level summary.  The details for individual functions are not
displayed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-dump
Causes \fBllvm\-bcanalyzer\fP to dump the bitcode in a human readable
format.  This format is significantly different from LLVM assembly and
provides details about the encoding of the bitcode file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-verify
Causes \fBllvm\-bcanalyzer\fP to verify the module produced by reading the
bitcode.  This ensures that the statistics generated are based on a consistent
module.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-help
Print a summary of command line options.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
If \fBllvm\-bcanalyzer\fP succeeds, it will exit with 0.  Otherwise, if an
error occurs, it will exit with a non\-zero value, usually 1.
