.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBllvm\-cov\fP \fIcommand\fP [\fIargs...\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBllvm\-cov\fP tool shows code coverage information for
programs that are instrumented to emit profile data. It can be used to
work with \fBgcov\fP\-style coverage or with \fBclang\fP\(aqs instrumentation
based profiling.
.sp
If the program is invoked with a base name of \fBgcov\fP, it will behave as if
the \fBllvm\-cov gcov\fP command were called. Otherwise, a command should
be provided.

.SS SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBllvm\-cov gcov\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fISOURCEFILE\fP
.SS DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBllvm\-cov gcov\fP tool reads code coverage data files and displays
the coverage information for a specified source file. It is compatible with the
\fBgcov\fP tool from version 4.2 of \fBGCC\fP and may also be compatible with some
later versions of \fBgcov\fP\&.
.sp
To use \fBllvm\-cov gcov\fP, you must first build an instrumented version
of your application that collects coverage data as it runs. Compile with the
\fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fP and \fB\-ftest\-coverage\fP options to add the
instrumentation. (Alternatively, you can use the \fB\-\-coverage\fP option, which
includes both of those other options.) You should compile with debugging
information (\fB\-g\fP) and without optimization (\fB\-O0\fP); otherwise, the
coverage data cannot be accurately mapped back to the source code.
.sp
At the time you compile the instrumented code, a \fB\&.gcno\fP data file will be
generated for each object file. These \fB\&.gcno\fP files contain half of the
coverage data. The other half of the data comes from \fB\&.gcda\fP files that are
generated when you run the instrumented program, with a separate \fB\&.gcda\fP
file for each object file. Each time you run the program, the execution counts
are summed into any existing \fB\&.gcda\fP files, so be sure to remove any old
files if you do not want their contents to be included.
.sp
By default, the \fB\&.gcda\fP files are written into the same directory as the
object files, but you can override that by setting the \fBGCOV_PREFIX\fP and
\fBGCOV_PREFIX_STRIP\fP environment variables. The \fBGCOV_PREFIX_STRIP\fP
variable specifies a number of directory components to be removed from the
start of the absolute path to the object file directory. After stripping those
directories, the prefix from the \fBGCOV_PREFIX\fP variable is added. These
environment variables allow you to run the instrumented program on a machine
where the original object file directories are not accessible, but you will
then need to copy the \fB\&.gcda\fP files back to the object file directories
where \fBllvm\-cov gcov\fP expects to find them.
.sp
Once you have generated the coverage data files, run \fBllvm\-cov gcov\fP
for each main source file where you want to examine the coverage results. This
should be run from the same directory where you previously ran the
compiler. The results for the specified source file are written to a file named
by appending a \fB\&.gcov\fP suffix. A separate output file is also created for
each file included by the main source file, also with a \fB\&.gcov\fP suffix added.
.sp
The basic content of an \fB\&.gcov\fP output file is a copy of the source file with
an execution count and line number prepended to every line. The execution
count is shown as \fB\-\fP if a line does not contain any executable code. If
a line contains code but that code was never executed, the count is displayed
as \fB#####\fP\&.
.SS OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-all\-blocks
Display all basic blocks. If there are multiple blocks for a single line of
source code, this option causes llvm\-cov to show the count for each block
instead of just one count for the entire line.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-branch\-probabilities
Display conditional branch probabilities and a summary of branch information.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-branch\-counts
Display branch counts instead of probabilities (requires \-b).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-function\-summaries
Show a summary of coverage for each function instead of just one summary for
an entire source file.

.TP
.B \-\-help
Display available options (\-\-help\-hidden for more).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-long\-file\-names
For coverage output of files included from the main source file, add the
main file name followed by \fB##\fP as a prefix to the output file names. This
can be combined with the \-\-preserve\-paths option to use complete paths for
both the main file and the included file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-no\-output
Do not output any \fB\&.gcov\fP files. Summary information is still
displayed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-o=<DIR|FILE>, \-\-object\-directory=<DIR>, \-\-object\-file=<FILE>
Find objects in DIR or based on FILE\(aqs path. If you specify a particular
object file, the coverage data files are expected to have the same base name
with \fB\&.gcno\fP and \fB\&.gcda\fP extensions. If you specify a directory, the
files are expected in that directory with the same base name as the source
file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-preserve\-paths
Preserve path components when naming the coverage output files. In addition
to the source file name, include the directories from the path to that
file. The directories are separate by \fB#\fP characters, with \fB\&.\fP directories
removed and \fB\&..\fP directories replaced by \fB^\fP characters. When used with
the \-\-long\-file\-names option, this applies to both the main file name and the
included file name.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-unconditional\-branches
Include unconditional branches in the output for the \-\-branch\-probabilities
option.

.SS EXIT STATUS
.sp
\fBllvm\-cov gcov\fP returns 1 if it cannot read input files.  Otherwise,
it exits with zero.
.SH SHOW COMMAND
.SS SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBllvm\-cov show\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \-instr\-profile \fIPROFILE\fP \fIBIN\fP [\fI\-object BIN,...\fP] [[\fI\-object BIN\fP]] [\fISOURCES\fP]
.SS DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBllvm\-cov show\fP command shows line by line coverage of the
binaries \fIBIN\fP,...  using the profile data \fIPROFILE\fP\&. It can optionally be
filtered to only show the coverage for the files listed in \fISOURCES\fP\&.
.sp
To use \fBllvm\-cov show\fP, you need a program that is compiled with
instrumentation to emit profile and coverage data. To build such a program with
\fBclang\fP use the \fB\-fprofile\-instr\-generate\fP and \fB\-fcoverage\-mapping\fP
flags. If linking with the \fBclang\fP driver, pass \fB\-fprofile\-instr\-generate\fP
to the link stage to make sure the necessary runtime libraries are linked in.
.sp
The coverage information is stored in the built executable or library itself,
and this is what you should pass to \fBllvm\-cov show\fP as a \fIBIN\fP
argument. The profile data is generated by running this instrumented program
normally. When the program exits it will write out a raw profile file,
typically called \fBdefault.profraw\fP, which can be converted to a format that
is suitable for the \fIPROFILE\fP argument using the \fBllvm\-profdata merge\fP
tool.
.SS OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-arch=[*NAMES*]
Specify a list of architectures such that the Nth entry in the list
corresponds to the Nth specified binary. If the covered object is a universal
binary, this specifies the architecture to use. It is an error to specify an
architecture that is not included in the universal binary or to use an
architecture that does not match a non\-universal binary.

only supported for the html format.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-output\-dir=PATH
Specify a directory to write coverage reports into. If the directory does not
exist, it is created. When used in function view mode (i.e when \-name or
\-name\-regex are used to select specific functions), the report is written to
PATH/functions.EXTENSION. When used in file view mode, a report for each file
is written to PATH/REL_PATH_TO_FILE.EXTENSION.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-Xdemangler=<TOOL>|<TOOL\-OPTION>
Specify a symbol demangler. This can be used to make reports more
human\-readable. This option can be specified multiple times to supply
arguments to the demangler (e.g \fI\-Xdemangler c++filt \-Xdemangler \-n\fP for C++).
The demangler is expected to read a newline\-separated list of symbols from
stdin and write a newline\-separated list of the same length to stdout.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-num\-threads=N, \-j=N
Use N threads to write file reports (only applicable when \-output\-dir is
specified). When N=0, llvm\-cov auto\-detects an appropriate number of threads to
use. This is the default.
