.Sh NAME
.Nm ctlstat
.Nd CAM Target Layer statistics utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl t
.Op Fl c Ar count
.Op Fl C
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl D
.Op Fl j
.Op Fl l Ar lun
.Op Fl n Ar numdevs
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl w Ar wait
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides statistics information for the CAM Target Layer.
The first display (except for dump and JSON modes) shows average statistics
since system startup.
Subsequent displays show average statistics during the measurement
interval.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Fl t
Total mode.
This displays separate columns with the total read and write output,
and a combined total column that also includes non I/O operations.
.It Fl c Ar count
Display statistics this many times.
.It Fl C
Disable CPU statistics display.
.It Fl d
Display DMA operation time (latency) instead of overall I/O time (latency).
.It Fl D
Text dump mode.
Dump statistics every 30 seconds in a text format suitable for parsing.
No statistics are computed in this mode, only raw numbers are displayed.
.It Fl h
Suppress display of the header.
.It Fl j
JSON dump mode.
Dump statistics every 30 seconds in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.
No statistics are computed in this mode, only raw numbers are displayed.
.It Fl l Ar lun
Request statistics for the specified LUN.
.It Fl n Ar numdevs
Display statistics for this many devices.
.It Fl p Ar port
Request statistics for the specified port.
.It Fl w Ar wait
Wait this many seconds in between displays.
If this option is not specified,
.Nm
defaults to a 1 second interval.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl ctlstat -t
.Pp
Display total statistics for the system with a one second interval.
.Pp
.Dl ctlstat -d -l 5 -C
.Pp
Display average DMA time for LUN 5 and omit CPU utilization.
.Pp
.Dl ctlstat -n 7 -w 10
.Pp
Display statistics for the first 7 LUNs, and display average statistics
every 10 seconds.
