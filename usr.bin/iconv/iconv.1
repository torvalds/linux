.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility converts the codeset of
.Ar file
(or from standard input if no file is specified) from codeset
.Ar from_name
to codeset
.Ar to_name
and outputs the
converted text on standard output.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width 0123
.It Fl c
Prevent output of any invalid characters.
By default,
.Nm
outputs an
.Dq invalid character
specified by the
.Ar to_name
codeset when it encounts a character which is valid in the
.Ar from_name
codeset but does not have a corresponding character in the
.Ar to_name
codeset.
.It Fl f
Specifies the source codeset name as
.Ar from_name .
.It Fl l
Lists available codeset names.
Note that not all combinations of
.Ar from_name
and
.Ar to_name
are valid.
.It Fl s
Silent.
By default,
.Nm
outputs the number of
.Dq invalid characters
to standard error if they exist.
This option prevents this behaviour.
.It Fl t
Specifies the destination codeset name as
.Ar to_name .
