.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility formats the program sources specified as arguments
on the command line in a nice style using
.Xr troff 1 .
Comments are placed in italics, keywords in bold face,
and the name of the current function is listed down the margin of each
page as it is encountered.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility runs in two basic modes, filter mode (see the
.Fl f
option) or regular mode.
In filter mode
.Nm
acts as a filter in a manner similar to
.Xr tbl 1 .
The standard input is passed directly to the standard output except
for lines bracketed by the
.Em troff-like
macros:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \&.vS
starts processing
.It \&.vE
ends processing
.El
.Pp
These lines are formatted as described above.
The output from this
filter can be passed to
.Xr troff 1
for output.
There need be no particular ordering with
.Xr eqn 1
or
.Xr tbl 1 .
.Pp
In regular mode
.Nm
accepts input files, processes them, and passes them to the postprocessor
for output,
.Xr psroff 1
by default.
.Pp
In both modes
.Nm
passes any lines beginning with a decimal point without conversion.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl
forces input to be taken from standard input (default if
.Fl f
is specified)
.It Fl W
forces output to the (wide) Versatec printer rather than the (narrow)
Varian
.It Fl d Ar file
specifies an alternate language definitions
file (default is
.Pa /usr/share/misc/vgrindefs )
.It Fl f
forces filter mode
.It Fl h Ar header
specifies a particular header to put on every output page (default is
the file name)
.It Fl l
specifies the language to use.

.Tn PASCAL
.Pq Fl l Ns Ar p ,
.Tn MODEL
.Pq Fl l Ns Ar m ,

.Tn LISP
.Pq Fl l Ns Ar isp ,
.Tn ICON
.Pq Fl l Ns Ar I ,
and
.Tn PERL
.Pq Fl l Ns Ar perl .
.It Fl n
forces no keyword bolding
.It Fl p Ar postproc
use
.Ar postproc
to post-process the output,
.Xr psroff 1
by default.
.It Fl s Ar pointsize
specifies a point size to use on output (exactly the same as the argument
of a .ps)
.It Fl t
similar to the same option in
.Xr troff 1
causing formatted text to go to the standard output
.It Fl x
outputs the index file in a ``pretty'' format.
The index file itself is produced whenever
.Nm
is run with a file called
.Pa index
in the current directory.
The index of function
definitions can then be run off by giving
.Nm
the
.Fl x
option and the file
.Pa index
as argument.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The vfontedpr preprocessor assumes that a certain programming style is
followed:
.Pp
For
.Tn C
\- function names can be preceded on a line only by spaces, tabs, or an
asterisk.
The parenthesized arguments must also be on the same line.
.Pp
For
.Tn PASCAL
\- function names need to appear on the same line as the keywords
.Em function
or
.Em procedure .
.Pp
For
.Tn MODEL
\- function names need to appear on the same line as the keywords
.Em is beginproc .
.Pp
If these conventions are not followed, the indexing and marginal function
name comment mechanisms will fail.
.Pp
More generally, arbitrary formatting styles for programs mostly look bad.
The use of spaces to align source code fails miserably; if you plan to
.Nm
your program you should use tabs.
This is somewhat inevitable since the
font used by
.Nm
is variable width.
.Pp
The mechanism of
.Xr ctags 1
in recognizing functions should be used here.
.Pp
Filter mode does not work in documents using the
.Fl me
or
.Fl ms
macros.
(So what use is it anyway?)
