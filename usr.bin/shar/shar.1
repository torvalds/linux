.Sh NAME
.Nm shar
.Nd create a shell archive of files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command writes a
.Xr sh 1
shell script to the standard output which will recreate the file
hierarchy specified by the command line operands.
Directories will be recreated and must be specified before the
files they contain (the
.Xr find 1
utility does this correctly).
.Pp
The
.Nm
command is normally used for distributing files by
.Xr ftp 1
or
.Xr mail 1 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
To create a shell archive of the program
.Xr ls 1
and mail it to Rick:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd ls
shar `find . -print` \&| mail -s "ls source" rick
.Ed
.Pp
To recreate the program directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mkdir ls
cd ls
\&...
<delete header lines and examine mailed archive>
\&...
sh archive
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr compress 1 ,
.Xr mail 1 ,
.Xr tar 1 ,
.Xr uuencode 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
command makes no provisions for special types of files or files containing
magic characters.
The
.Nm
command cannot handle files without a newline ('\\n')
as the last character.
.Pp
It is easy to insert trojan horses into
.Nm
files.
It is strongly recommended that all shell archive files be examined
before running them through
.Xr sh 1 .
Archives produced using this implementation of
.Nm
may be easily examined with the command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
egrep -av '^[X#]' shar.file
.Ed
