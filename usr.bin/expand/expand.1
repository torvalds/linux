The

utility processes the named files or the standard input writing
the standard output with tabs changed into blanks.

the column count for tab calculations.

(before sorting, looking at specific columns, etc.) that
contain tabs.

The
.Nm unexpand
utility puts tabs back into the data from the standard input or the named
files and writes the result on the standard output.

.Nm ( unexpand

resultant file by replacing two or more characters.
