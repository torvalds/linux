.Sh NAME
.Nm resizewin
.Nd update terminal size
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl z
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
queries the terminal emulator for the current window size and updates
the size known to the kernel using the
.Dv TIOCSWINSZ
ioctl.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl z"
.It Fl z
Do nothing unless the current kernel terminal size is zero.
This is useful when run from a user's profile (shell startup) scripts:
querying the window size is required for serial lines, but not when
logging in over the network, as protocols like TELNET or SSH already
handle the terminal size by themselves.
.El
.Pp
After a terminal window has been resized, running
.Nm
updates the kernel's window size to match the new size.
.Pp
.Nm
is functionally similar to
.Xr resize 1 ,
which is part of the
.Xr xterm 1
distribution.
However,
.Nm
only works with VT100/ANSI-compatible terminals and does not emit
commands to set environment variables.
.Pp
The terminal is assumed to be VT100/ANSI compatible.
The VT100/ANSI escape sequences are supported by virtually all modern
terminals, including xterm, konsole, gnome-terminal, iTerm,
Terminal.app, and PuTTY.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr stty 1 ,
.Xr tty 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Fx 11.0 .
