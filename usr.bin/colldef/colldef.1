.Sh NAME
.Nm colldef
.Nd convert collation sequence source definition
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl I Ar map_dir
.Op Fl o Ar out_file
.Op Ar filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility converts a collation sequence source definition
into a format usable by the
.Fn strxfrm
and
.Fn strcoll
functions.
It is used to define the many ways in which
strings can be ordered and collated.
The
.Fn strxfrm
function transforms
its first argument and places the result in its second
argument.
The transformed string is such that it can be
correctly ordered with other transformed strings by using
.Fn strcmp ,
.Fn strncmp ,
or
.Fn memcmp .
The
.Fn strcoll
function transforms its arguments and does a
comparison.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility reads the collation sequence source definition
from the standard input and stores the converted definition in filename.
The output file produced contains the
database with collating sequence information in a form
usable by system commands and routines.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl I Ar map_dir
Set directory name where
.Ar charmap
files can be found, current directory by default.
.It Fl o Ar out_file
Set output file name,
.Ar LC_COLLATE
by default.
.El
.Pp
The collation sequence definition specifies a set of collating elements and
the rules defining how strings containing these should be ordered.
This is most useful for different language definitions.
.Pp
The specification file can consist of three statements:
.Ar charmap ,
.Ar substitute
and
.Ar order .
.Pp
Of these, only the
.Ar order
statement is required.
When
.Ar charmap
or
.Ar substitute
is
supplied, these statements must be ordered as above.
Any
statements after the order statement are ignored.
.Pp
Lines in the specification file beginning with a
.Ql #
are
treated as comments and are ignored.
Blank lines are also
ignored.
.Pp
.Dl "charmap charmapfile"
.Pp
.Ar Charmap
defines where a mapping of the character
and collating element symbols to the actual
character encoding can be found.
.Pp
The format of
.Ar charmapfile
is shown below.
Symbol
names are separated from their values by TAB or
SPACE characters.
Symbol-value can be specified in
a hexadecimal (\ex\fI??\fR) or octal (\e\fI???\fR)
representation, and can be only one character in length.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
symbol-name1 symbol-value1
symbol-name2 symbol-value2
\&...
.Ed
.Pp
Symbol names cannot be specified in
.Ar substitute
fields.
.Pp
The
.Ar charmap
statement is optional.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
substitute "symbol" with "repl_string"
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ar substitute
statement substitutes the character
.Ar symbol
with the string
.Ar repl_string .
Symbol names cannot be specified in
.Ar repl_string
field.
The
.Ar substitute
statement is optional.
.Pp
.Dl "order order_list"
.Pp
.Ar Order_list
is a list of symbols, separated by semi colons, that defines the
collating sequence.
The
special symbol
.Ar ...
specifies, in a short-hand
form, symbols that are sequential in machine code
order.
.Pp
An order list element
can be represented in any one of the following
ways:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The symbol itself (for example,
.Ar a
for the lower-case letter
.Ar a ) .
.It
The symbol in octal representation (for example,
.Ar \e141
for the letter
.Ar a ) .
.It
The symbol in hexadecimal representation (for example,
.Ar \ex61
for the letter
.Ar a ) .
.It
The symbol name as defined in the
.Ar charmap
file (for example,
.Ar <letterA>
for
.Ar letterA \e023
record in
.Ar charmapfile ) .
If character map name have
.Ar >
character, it must be escaped as
.Ar /> ,
single
.Ar /
must be escaped as
.Ar // .
.It
Symbols
.Ar \ea ,
.Ar \eb ,
.Ar \ef ,
.Ar \en ,
.Ar \er ,
.Ar \ev
are permitted in its usual C-language meaning.
.It
The symbol chain (for example:
.Ar abc ,
.Ar <letterA><letterB>c ,
.Ar \exf1b\exf2 )
.It
The symbol range (for example,
.Ar a;...;z ) .
.It
Comma-separated symbols, ranges and chains enclosed in parenthesis (for example
.Ar \&(
.Ar sym1 ,
.Ar sym2 ,
.Ar ...
.Ar \&) )
are assigned the
same primary ordering but different secondary
ordering.
.It
Comma-separated symbols, ranges and chains enclosed in curly brackets (for example
.Ar \&{
.Ar sym1 ,
.Ar sym2 ,
.Ar ...
.Ar \&} )
are assigned the same primary ordering only.
.El
.Pp
The backslash character
.Ar \e
is used for continuation.
In this case, no characters are permitted
after the backslash character.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pa /usr/share/locale/ Ns Ao Ar language Ac Ns Pa /LC_COLLATE
The standard shared location for collation orders
under the locale
.Aq Ar language .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with the following values:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Li 0
No errors were found and the output was successfully created.
.It Li !=0
Errors were found.
