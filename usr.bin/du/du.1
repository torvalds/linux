.Sh NAME
.Nm du
.Nd display disk usage statistics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Aclnx
.Op Fl H | L | P
.Op Fl g | h | k | m
.Op Fl a | s | d Ar depth
.Op Fl B Ar blocksize
.Op Fl I Ar mask
.Op Fl t Ar threshold
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays the file system block usage for each file argument
and for each directory in the file hierarchy rooted in each directory
argument.
If no file is specified, the block usage of the hierarchy rooted in
the current directory is displayed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A
Display the apparent size instead of the disk usage.
This can be helpful when operating on compressed volumes or sparse files.
.It Fl B Ar blocksize
Calculate block counts in
.Ar blocksize
byte blocks.
This is different from the
.Fl h, k, m,
.Fl Fl si
and
.Fl g
options or setting
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
and gives an estimate of how much space the examined file hierarchy would
require on a filesystem with the given
.Ar blocksize .
Unless in
.Fl A
mode,
.Ar blocksize
is rounded up to the next multiple of 512.
.It Fl H
Symbolic links on the command line are followed, symbolic links in file
hierarchies are not followed.
.It Fl I Ar mask
Ignore files and directories matching the specified
.Ar mask .
.It Fl L
Symbolic links on the command line and in file hierarchies are followed.
.It Fl P
No symbolic links are followed.
This is the default.
.It Fl a
Display an entry for each file in a file hierarchy.
.It Fl c
Display a grand total.
.It Fl d Ar depth
Display an entry for all files and directories
.Ar depth
directories deep.
.It Fl g
Display block counts in 1073741824-byte (1 GiB) blocks.
.It Fl h
.Dq Human-readable
output.
Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte based on powers of 1024.
.It Fl k
Display block counts in 1024-byte (1 kiB) blocks.
.It Fl l
If a file has multiple hard links, count its size multiple times.
The default behavior of
.Nm
is to count files with multiple hard links only once.
When the
.Fl l
option is specified, the hard link checks are disabled, and these files
are counted (and displayed) as many times as they are found.
.It Fl m
Display block counts in 1048576-byte (1 MiB) blocks.
.It Fl n
Ignore files and directories with user
.Dq nodump
flag
.Pq Dv UF_NODUMP
set.
.It Fl r
Generate messages about directories that cannot be read, files
that cannot be opened, and so on.
This is the default case.
This option exists solely for conformance with
.St -xpg4 .
.It Fl s
Display an entry for each specified file.
(Equivalent to
.Fl d Li 0 )
.It Fl Fl si
.Dq Human-readable
output.
Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte based on powers of 1000.
.It Fl t Ar threshold
Display only entries for which size exceeds
.Ar threshold .
If
.Ar threshold
is negative, display only entries for which size is less than the absolute
value of
.Ar threshold .
.It Fl x
File system mount points are not traversed.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility counts the storage used by symbolic links and not the files they
reference unless the
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
option is specified.
If either the
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
option is specified, storage used by any symbolic links which are
followed is not counted (or displayed).
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L
and
.Fl P
options override each other and the command's actions are determined
by the last one specified.
.Pp
The
.Fl h, k, m
and
.Fl Fl si
options all override each other; the last one specified determines
the block counts used.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environment variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, and the
.Fl h, k, m
or
.Fl Fl si
options are not specified, the block counts will be displayed in units of
that block size.
If
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is not set, and the
.Fl h, k, m
or
.Fl Fl si
options are not specified, the block counts will be displayed in 512-byte
blocks.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Show disk usage for all files in the current directory.
Output is in human-readable form:
.Pp
.Dl # du -ah
.Pp
Summarize disk usage in the current directory:
.Pp
.Dl # du -hs
.Pp
Summarize disk usage for a specific directory:
.Pp
.Dl # du -hs /home
.Pp
Show name and size of all C files in a specific directory.
Also display a grand total at the end:
.Pp
.Dl # du -ch /usr/src/sys/kern/*.c
