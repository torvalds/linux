.Sh NAME
.Nm whereis
.Nd locate programs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl abmqsux
.Op Fl BMS Ar dir ... Fl f
.Ar program ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility checks the standard binary, manual page, and source
directories for the specified programs, printing out the paths of any
it finds.
The supplied program names are first stripped of leading
path name components, any single trailing extension added by
.Xr gzip 1 ,
.Xr compress 1 ,
or
.Xr bzip2 1 ,
and the leading
.Ql s.\&
or trailing
.Ql ,v
from a source code control system.
.Pp
The default path searched is the string returned by the
.Xr sysctl 8
utility for the
.Dq user.cs_path
string, with
.Pa /usr/libexec
and the current user's
.Ev $PATH
appended.
Manual pages are searched by default along the
.Ev $MANPATH .
Program sources are located in a list of known standard places,
including all the subdirectories of
.Pa /usr/src
and
.Pa /usr/ports .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl B
Specify directories to search for binaries.
Requires the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl M
Specify directories to search for manual pages.
Requires the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl S
Specify directories to search for program sources.
Requires the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl a
Report all matches instead of only the first of each requested type.
.It Fl b
Search for binaries.
.It Fl f
Delimits the list of directories after the
.Fl B ,
.Fl M ,
or
.Fl S
options, and indicates the beginning of the
.Ar program
list.
.It Fl m
Search for manual pages.
.It Fl q
.Pq Dq quiet .
Suppress the output of the utility name in front of the normal
output line.
This can become handy for use in a backquote substitution of a
shell command line, see
.Sx EXAMPLES .
.It Fl s
Search for source directories.
.It Fl u
Search for
.Dq unusual
entries.
A file is said to be unusual if it does not have at least
one entry of each requested type.
Only the name of the unusual entry is printed.
.It Fl x
Do not use
.Dq expensive
tools when searching for source directories.
Normally, after unsuccessfully searching all the first-level
subdirectories of the source directory list,
.Nm
will ask
.Xr locate 1
to find the entry on its behalf.
Since this can take much longer, it can be turned off with
.Fl x .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following finds all utilities under
.Pa /usr/bin
that do not have documentation:
.Pp
.Dl whereis -m -u /usr/bin/*
.Pp
Change to the source code directory of
.Xr ls 1 :
.Pp
.Dl cd `whereis -sq ls`
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr find 1 ,
.Xr locate 1 ,
.Xr man 1 ,
.Xr which 1 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
This version re-implements the historical
functionality that was lost in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh AUTHORS
This implementation of the
.Nm
command was written by
.An J\(:org Wunsch .
.Sh BUGS
This re-implementation of the
.Nm
utility is not bug-for-bug compatible with historical versions.
It is believed to be compatible with the version that was shipping with
.Fx 2.2
through
.Fx 4.5
though.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility can report some unrelated source entries when the
.Fl a
option is specified.
