data structures.
There are a number of output formats,
depending on the options for the information presented.

.Op Fl f Ar protocol_family | Fl p Ar protocol
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Ek
.Xc
Display a list of active sockets
(protocol control blocks)
for each network protocol.
.Pp
The default display for active sockets shows the local
and remote addresses, send and receive queue sizes (in bytes), protocol,
and the internal state of the protocol.
Address formats are of the form
.Dq host.port
or
.Dq network.port
if a socket's address specifies a network but no specific host address.
When known, the host and network addresses are displayed symbolically
according to the databases
.Xr hosts 5
and
.Xr networks 5 ,
respectively.
If a symbolic name for an address is unknown, or if
the
.Fl n
option is specified, the address is printed numerically, according
to the address family.
For more information regarding
the Internet IPv4
.Dq dot format ,
refer to
.Xr inet 3 .
Unspecified,
or
.Dq wildcard ,
addresses and ports appear as
.Dq Li * .

associated with a socket; used for debugging.
.It Fl a
Show the state of all sockets;
normally sockets used by server processes are not shown.
.It Fl L
Show the size of the various listen queues.
The first count shows the number of unaccepted connections,
the second count shows the amount of unaccepted incomplete connections,
and the third count is the maximum number of queued connections.
.It Fl n
Do not resolve numeric addresses and port numbers to names.
See
.Sx GENERAL OPTIONS .
.It Fl P
Display the log ID for each socket.
.It Fl R
Display the flowid and flowtype for each socket.
flowid is a 32 bit hardware specific identifier for each flow.
flowtype defines which protocol fields are hashed to produce the id.
A complete listing is available in
.Pa sys/mbuf.h
under
.Dv M_HASHTYPE_* .
.It Fl S
Show network addresses as numbers (as with
.Fl n )
but show ports symbolically.
.It Fl T
Display diagnostic information from the TCP control block.
Fields include the number of packets requiring retransmission,
received out-of-order, and those advertising a zero-sized window.
.It Fl W
Avoid truncating addresses even if this causes some fields to overflow.
.It Fl x
Display socket buffer and TCP timer statistics for each
internet socket.
.Pp
The
.Fl x
flag causes
.Nm
to output all the information recorded about data
stored in the socket buffers.
The fields are:
.Bl -column ".Li R-MBUF"
.It Li R-MBUF Ta Number of mbufs in the receive queue.
.It Li S-MBUF Ta Number of mbufs in the send queue.
.It Li R-CLUS Ta Number of clusters, of any type, in the receive
queue.

.It Li S-BCNT Ta Send buffer byte count.
.It Li R-BMAX Ta Maximum bytes that can be used in the receive buffer.
.It Li S-BMAX Ta Maximum bytes that can be used in the send buffer.
.It Li rexmt Ta Time, in seconds, to fire Retransmit Timer, or 0 if not armed.
.It Li persist Ta Time, in seconds, to fire Retransmit Persistence, or 0 if not armed.
.It Li keep Ta Time, in seconds, to fire Keep Alive, or 0 if not armed.

Display the contents of routing tables.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is invoked with the routing table option
.Fl r ,
it lists the available routes and their status.
Each route consists of a destination host or network, and a gateway to use
in forwarding packets.
The flags field shows a collection of information about the route stored
as binary choices.
The individual flags are discussed in more detail in the
.Xr route 8
and
.Xr route 4
manual pages.
The mapping between letters and flags is:
.Bl -column ".Li W" ".Dv RTF_WASCLONED"
.It Li 1 Ta Dv RTF_PROTO1 Ta "Protocol specific routing flag #1"
.It Li 2 Ta Dv RTF_PROTO2 Ta "Protocol specific routing flag #2"

.It Li X Ta Dv RTF_XRESOLVE Ta "External daemon translates proto to link address"
.El
.Pp
Direct routes are created for each
interface attached to the local host;
the gateway field for such entries shows the address of the outgoing interface.
The refcnt field gives the
current number of active uses of the route.
Connection oriented
protocols normally hold on to a single route for the duration of
a connection while connectionless protocols obtain a route while sending
to the same destination.
The use field provides a count of the number of packets
sent using that route.
The interface entry indicates the network interface utilized for the route.
