.Sh NAME
.Nm localedef
.Nd define locale environment
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl bcDlUv
.Op Fl f Ar charmap
.Op Fl i Ar sourcefile
.Op Fl u Ar codeset
.Op Fl w Ar widthfile
.Ar localename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility converts source definitions for locale categories
into a format usable by the functions and utilities whose operational behavior
is determined by the setting of the locale environment variables; see
.Xr environ 7 .
.Pp
The utility reads source definitions for one or more locale categories
belonging to the same locale from the file named in the
.Fl i
option (if specified) or from standard input.
.Pp
Each category source definition is identified by the corresponding environment
variable name and terminated by an
.Sy END
.Em category-name
statement.
The following categories are supported:
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev LC_MONETARY"
.It Ev LC_CTYPE
Defines character classification and case conversion.
.It Ev LC_COLLATE
Defines collation rules.
.It Ev LC_MONETARY
Defines the format and symbols used in formatting of monetary information.
.It Ev LC_NUMERIC
Defines the decimal delimiter, grouping and grouping symbol for non-monetary
numeric editing.
.It Ev LC_TIME
Defines the format and content of date and time information.
.It Ev LC_MESSAGES
Defines the format and values of affirmative and negative responses.
.El
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Use big-endian byte order for output.
.It Fl c
Creates permanent output even if warning messages have been issued.
.It Fl D
BSD-style
output.
Rather than the default of creating the
.Ar localename
directory and creating files like
.Pa LC_CTYPE ,
.Pa LC_COLLATE ,
etc.\& in that directory,
the output file names have the format
.Dq <localename>.<category>
and are dumped to the current directory.
.It Fl f Ar charmap
Specifies the pathname of a file containing a mapping of character symbols and
collating element symbols to actual character encodings.
This option must be specified if symbolic names (other than collating symbols
defined in a
.Sy collating-symbol
keyword) are used.
If the
.Fl f
option is not present, the default character mapping will be used.
.It Fl i Ar sourcefile
The path name of a file containing the source definitions.
If this option is not present, source definitions will be read from
standard input.
.It Fl l
Use little-endian byte order for output.
.It Fl u Ar codeset
Specifies the name of a codeset used as the target mapping of character symbols
and collating element symbols whose encoding values are defined in terms of the
ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 standard position constant values.
See
.Sx NOTES .
.It Fl U
Ignore the presence of character symbols that have no matching character
definition.  This facilitates the use of a common locale definition file
to be used across multiple encodings, even when some symbols are not
present in a given encoding.
.It Fl v
Emit verbose debugging output on standard output.
.It Fl w Ar widthfile
The path name of the file containing character screen width definitions.
If not supplied, then default screen widths will be assumed, which will
generally not account for East Asian encodings requiring more than a single
character cell to display, nor for combining or accent marks that occupy
no additional screen width.
.El
.Pp
The following operands are required:
.Bl -tag -width ".Ar localename"
.It Ar localename
Identifies the locale.
If the name contains one or more slash characters,
.Ar localename
will be interpreted as a path name where the created locale
definitions will be stored.
This capability may be restricted to users with appropriate privileges.
(As a consequence of specifying one
.Ar localename ,
although several categories can be processed in one execution, only categories
belonging to the same locale can be processed.)
.El
.Sh OUTPUT
.Nm
creates a directory of files that represents the locale's data,
unless instructed otherwise by the
.Fl D (
BSD
output) option.
The contants of this directory should generally be copied into the
appropriate subdirectory of
.Pa /usr/share/locale
in order the definitions to be visible to programs linked with libc.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
See
.Xr environ 7
for definitions of the following environment variables that affect the
execution of
.Nm :
.Ev LANG ,
.Ev LC_ALL ,
.Ev LC_COLLATE ,
.Ev LC_CTYPE ,
.Ev LC_MESSAGES ,
.Ev LC_MONETARY ,
.Ev LC_MUMERIC ,
.Ev LC_TIME ,
and
.Ev NLSPATH .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The following exit values are returned:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It 0
No errors occurred and the locales were successfully created.
.It 1
Warnings occurred and the locales were successfully created.
.It 2
The locale specification exceeded implementation limits or the coded character
set or sets used were not supported by the implementation, and no locale was
created.
.It >3
Warnings or errors occurred and no output was created.
.El
.Pp
If an error is detected, no permanent output will be created.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr locale 1 ,
.Xr iconv_open 3 ,
.Xr nl_langinfo 3 ,
.Xr strftime 3 ,
.Xr environ 7
.Sh WARNINGS
If warnings occur, permanent output will be created if the
.Fl c
option was specified.
The following conditions will cause warning messages to be issued:
.Bl -bullet
.It
If a symbolic name not found in the
.Pa charmap
file is used for the descriptions of the
.Sy LC_CTYPE
or
.Sy LC_COLLATE
categories (for other categories, this will be an error condition).
.It
If optional keywords not supported by the implementation are present in the
source.
.El
.Sh NOTES
When the
.Fl u
option is used, the
.Ar codeset
option-argument is interpreted as a name of a codeset to which the
ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 standard position constant values are converted.
Both the ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 standard position constant values and
other formats (decimal, hexadecimal, or octal) are valid as encoding
values within the charmap file.
The
.Ar codeset
can be any codeset that is supported by the
.Fn iconv_open 3
function.
.Pp
When conflicts occur between the charmap specification of
.Ar codeset ,
.Em mb_cur_max ,
or
.Em mb_cur_min
and the corresponding value for the codeset represented by the
.Fl u
option-argument
.Ar codeset ,
the
.Nm
utility fails with an error.
.Pp
When conflicts occur between the charmap encoding values specified for symbolic
names of characters of the portable character set and the character encoding
values defined by the US-ASCII, the result is unspecified.
