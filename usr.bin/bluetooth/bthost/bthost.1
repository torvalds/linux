.Sh NAME
.Nm bthost
.Nd look up Bluetooth host names and Protocol Service Multiplexor values
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl bhp
.Ar host_or_protocol
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility looks for information about Bluetooth hosts and
Protocol Service Multiplexor (PSM) values.
It gets this information from the
.Pa /etc/bluetooth/hosts
and
.Pa /etc/bluetooth/protocols
files.
.Pp
In host mode, it simply converts between the host names and Bluetooth addresses.
The argument can be either a host name or a Bluetooth address.
The program first attempts to interpret it as a Bluetooth address.
If this fails, it will treat it as a host name.
A Bluetooth address consists of six hex bytes separated by a colon,
e.g.,
.Dq Li 01:02:03:04:05:06 .
A host name consists of names separated by dots, e.g.,
.Dq Li my.cell.phone .
.Pp
In protocol mode, it simply converts between the Protocol Service Multiplexor
names and assigned numbers.
The argument can be either a Protocol Service Multiplexor name or
an assigned number.
The program first attempts to interpret it as an assigned number.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Produce brief output.
.It Fl h
Display usage message and exit.
.It Fl p
Activate protocol mode.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility will print results to the standard output, and error messages to the
standard error.
An output can be quite different,
here is an example that demonstrates all of the possibilities:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% bthost localhost
Host localhost has address FF:FF:FF:00:00:00
% bthost ff:ff:ff:00:00:00
Host FF:FF:FF:00:00:00 has name localhost
% bthost -b localhost
FF:FF:FF:00:00:00
% bthost -b ff:ff:ff:00:00:00
localhost
% bthost do.not.exists
do.not.exists: Unknown host
% bthost 0:0:0:0:0:0
00:00:00:00:00:00: Unknown host
% bthost -p sdp
Protocol/Service Multiplexor sdp has number 1
% bthost -p 3
Protocol/Service Multiplexor rfcomm has number 3
% bthost -bp HID-Control
17
% bthost -p foo
foo: Unknown Protocol/Service Multiplexor
