If one or more
.Ar key
arguments are provided, they will be looked up in
.Ar database
using the appropriate function.
For example,

supports an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or host name;
and
.Dq Li services
supports a service name, service name/protocol name, numeric port, or

.Ar database
will be retrieved using the appropriate enumeration function and printed.
