.Sh NAME
.Nm basename , dirname
.Nd return filename or directory portion of pathname

.Nm
.Ar string
.Op Ar suffix
.Nm
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl s Ar suffix
.Ar string
.Op Ar ...
.Nm dirname
.Ar string
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility deletes any prefix ending with the last slash
.Ql \&/
character present in
.Ar string
(after first stripping trailing slashes),
and a
.Ar suffix ,
if given.
The
.Ar suffix
is not stripped if it is identical to the remaining characters in
.Ar string .
The resulting filename is written to the standard output.
A non-existent suffix is ignored.
If
.Fl a
is specified, then every argument is treated as a
.Ar string
as if
.Nm
were invoked with just one argument.
If
.Fl s
is specified, then the
.Ar suffix
is taken as its argument, and all other arguments are treated as a
.Ar string .
.Pp
The
.Nm dirname
utility deletes the filename portion, beginning
with the last slash
.Ql \&/
character to the end of
.Ar string
(after first stripping trailing slashes),
and writes the result to the standard output.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std basename dirname
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following line sets the shell variable
.Ev FOO
to
