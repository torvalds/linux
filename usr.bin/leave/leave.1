The
.Nm
utility waits until the specified time, then reminds you that you
have to leave.
You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the actual
time, at the time, and every minute thereafter.
When you log off,
.Nm
exits just before it would have
printed the next message.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar hhmm
The time of day is in the form
.Ar hhmm
where
.Ar hh
is a time in
hours (on a 12 or 24 hour clock), and
.Ar mm
are minutes.
All times are converted to a 12 hour clock, and assumed to
be in the next 12 hours.
.It Cm \&+
If the time is preceded by
.Sq Cm \&+ ,
the alarm will go off in hours and minutes
from the current time.
.El
.Pp
If no argument is given,
.Nm
prompts with "When do you
have to leave?".
A reply of newline causes
.Nm
to exit,
otherwise the reply is assumed to be a time.
This form is suitable for inclusion in a
.Pa .login
or
.Pa .profile .
.Pp
To get rid of
.Nm
you should either log off or use
