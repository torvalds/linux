.Sh NAME
.Nm bsdiff
.Nd "generate a patch between two binary files"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar oldfile newfile patchfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
compares
.Ar oldfile
to
.Ar newfile
and writes to
.Ar patchfile
a binary patch suitable for use by
.Xr bspatch 1 .
When
.Ar oldfile
and
.Ar newfile
are two versions of an executable program, the
patches produced are on average a factor of five smaller
than those produced by any other binary patch tool known
to the author.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
uses memory equal to 17 times the size of
.Ar oldfile ,
and requires
an absolute minimum working set size of 8 times the size of
.Ar oldfile .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bspatch 1
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Colin Percival Aq Mt cperciva@FreeBSD.org
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility does not store the hashes of
.Ar oldfile
or
.Ar newfile
in
.Ar patchfile .
As a result, it is possible to apply a patch to the wrong file; this
will usually produce garbage.
It is recommended that users of
.Nm
store the hashes of
.Ar oldfile
and
.Ar newfile
and compare against them before and after applying
.Ar patchfile .
