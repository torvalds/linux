.Sh NAME
.Nm awk
.Nd pattern-directed scanning and processing language
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm awk
.Op Fl safe
.Op Fl V
.Op Fl d Ns Op Ar n
.Op Fl F Ar fs
.Op Fl v Ar var Ns = Ns Ar value
.Op Ar prog | Fl f Ar progfile
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
scans each input
.Ar file
for lines that match any of a set of patterns specified literally in
.Ar prog
or in one or more files specified as
.Fl f Ar progfile .
With each pattern there can be an associated action that will be performed
when a line of a
.Ar file
matches the pattern.
Each line is matched against the
pattern portion of every pattern-action statement;
the associated action is performed for each matched pattern.
The file name
.Sq -
means the standard input.
Any
.Ar file
of the form
.Ar var Ns = Ns Ar value
is treated as an assignment, not a filename,
and is executed at the time it would have been opened if it were a filename.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-safe "
.It Fl d Ns Op Ar n
Debug mode.
Set debug level to
.Ar n ,
or 1 if
.Ar n
is not specified.
A value greater than 1 causes
.Nm
to dump core on fatal errors.
.It Fl F Ar fs
Define the input field separator to be the regular expression
.Ar fs .
.It Fl f Ar progfile
Read program code from the specified file
.Ar progfile
instead of from the command line.
.It Fl safe
Disable file output
.Pf ( Ic print No > ,
.Ic print No >> ) ,
process creation
.Po
.Ar cmd | Ic getline ,
.Ic print | ,
.Ic system
.Pc
and access to the environment
.Pf ( Va ENVIRON ;
see the section on variables below).
This is a first
.Pq and not very reliable
approximation to a
.Dq safe
version of
.Nm .
.It Fl V
Print the version number of
.Nm
to standard output and exit.
.It Fl v Ar var Ns = Ns Ar value
Assign
.Ar value
to variable
.Ar var
before
.Ar prog
is executed;
any number of
.Fl v
options may be present.
.El
.Pp
The input is normally made up of input lines
.Pq records
separated by newlines, or by the value of
.Va RS .
If
.Va RS
is null, then any number of blank lines are used as the record separator,
and newlines are used as field separators
(in addition to the value of
.Va FS ) .
This is convenient when working with multi-line records.
.Pp
An input line is normally made up of fields separated by whitespace,
or by the regular expression
.Va FS .
The fields are denoted
.Va $1 , $2 , ... ,
while
.Va $0
refers to the entire line.
If
.Va FS
is null, the input line is split into one field per character.
.Pp
Normally, any number of blanks separate fields.
In order to set the field separator to a single blank, use the
.Fl F
option with a value of
.Sq [\ \&] .
If a field separator of
.Sq t
is specified,
.Nm
treats it as if
.Sq \et
had been specified and uses
.Aq TAB
as the field separator.
In order to use a literal
.Sq t
as the field separator, use the
.Fl F
option with a value of
.Sq [t] .
.Pp
A pattern-action statement has the form
.Pp
.D1 Ar pattern Ic \&{ Ar action Ic \&}
.Pp
A missing
.Ic \&{ Ar action Ic \&}
means print the line;
a missing pattern always matches.
Pattern-action statements are separated by newlines or semicolons.
.Pp
Newlines are permitted after a terminating statement or following a comma
.Pq Sq ,\& ,
an open brace
.Pq Sq { ,
a logical AND
.Pq Sq && ,
a logical OR
.Pq Sq || ,
after the
.Sq do
or
.Sq else
keywords,
or after the closing parenthesis of an
.Sq if ,
.Sq for ,
or
.Sq while
statement.
Additionally, a backslash
.Pq Sq \e
can be used to escape a newline between tokens.
.Pp
An action is a sequence of statements.
A statement can be one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Ic if Ar ( expression ) Ar statement Op Ic else Ar statement
.It Ic while Ar ( expression ) Ar statement
.It Ic for Ar ( expression ; expression ; expression ) statement
.It Ic for Ar ( var Ic in Ar array ) statement
.It Ic do Ar statement Ic while Ar ( expression )
.It Ic break
.It Ic continue
.It Xo Ic {
.Op Ar statement ...
.Ic }
.Xc
.It Xo Ar expression
.No # commonly
.Ar var No = Ar expression
.Xc
.It Xo Ic print
.Op Ar expression-list
.Op > Ns Ar expression
.Xc
.It Xo Ic printf Ar format
.Op Ar ... , expression-list
.Op > Ns Ar expression
.Xc
.It Ic return Op Ar expression
.It Xo Ic next
.No # skip remaining patterns on this input line
.Xc
.It Xo Ic nextfile
.No # skip rest of this file, open next, start at top
.Xc
.It Xo Ic delete
.Sm off
.Ar array Ic \&[ Ar expression Ic \&]
.Sm on
.No # delete an array element
.Xc
.It Xo Ic delete Ar array
.No # delete all elements of array
.Xc
.It Xo Ic exit
.Op Ar expression
.No # exit immediately; status is Ar expression
.Xc
.El
.Pp
Statements are terminated by
semicolons, newlines or right braces.
An empty
.Ar expression-list
stands for
.Ar $0 .
String constants are quoted
.Li \&"" ,
with the usual C escapes recognized within
(see
.Xr printf 1
for a complete list of these).
Expressions take on string or numeric values as appropriate,
and are built using the operators
.Ic + \- * / % ^
.Pq exponentiation ,
and concatenation
.Pq indicated by whitespace .
The operators
.Ic \&! ++ \-\- += \-= *= /= %= ^=
.Ic > >= < <= == != ?:
are also available in expressions.
Variables may be scalars, array elements
(denoted
.Li x[i] )
or fields.
Variables are initialized to the null string.
Array subscripts may be any string,
not necessarily numeric;
this allows for a form of associative memory.
Multiple subscripts such as
.Li [i,j,k]
are permitted; the constituents are concatenated,
separated by the value of
.Va SUBSEP
.Pq see the section on variables below .
.Pp
The
.Ic print
statement prints its arguments on the standard output
(or on a file if
.Pf > Ar file
or
.Pf >> Ar file
is present or on a pipe if
.Pf |\ \& Ar cmd
is present), separated by the current output field separator,
and terminated by the output record separator.
.Ar file
and
.Ar cmd
may be literal names or parenthesized expressions;
identical string values in different statements denote
the same open file.
The
.Ic printf
statement formats its expression list according to the format
(see
.Xr printf 1 ) .
.Pp
Patterns are arbitrary Boolean combinations
(with
.Ic "\&! || &&" )
of regular expressions and
relational expressions.
.Nm
supports extended regular expressions
.Pq EREs .
See
.Xr re_format 7
for more information on regular expressions.
Isolated regular expressions
in a pattern apply to the entire line.
Regular expressions may also occur in
relational expressions, using the operators
.Ic ~
and
.Ic !~ .
.Pf / Ar re Ns /
is a constant regular expression;
any string (constant or variable) may be used
as a regular expression, except in the position of an isolated regular expression
in a pattern.
.Pp
A pattern may consist of two patterns separated by a comma;
in this case, the action is performed for all lines
from an occurrence of the first pattern
through an occurrence of the second.
.Pp
A relational expression is one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Ar expression matchop regular-expression
.It Ar expression relop expression
.It Ar expression Ic in Ar array-name
.It Xo Ic \&( Ns
.Ar expr , expr , \&... Ns Ic \&) in
.Ar array-name
.Xc
.El
.Pp
where a
.Ar relop
is any of the six relational operators in C, and a
.Ar matchop
is either
.Ic ~
(matches)
or
.Ic !~
(does not match).
A conditional is an arithmetic expression,
a relational expression,
or a Boolean combination
of these.
.Pp
The special patterns
.Ic BEGIN
and
.Ic END
may be used to capture control before the first input line is read
and after the last.
.Ic BEGIN
and
.Ic END
do not combine with other patterns.
.Pp
Variable names with special meanings:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "FILENAME " -compact
.It Va ARGC
Argument count, assignable.
.It Va ARGV
Argument array, assignable;
non-null members are taken as filenames.
.It Va CONVFMT
Conversion format when converting numbers
(default
.Qq Li %.6g ) .
.It Va ENVIRON
Array of environment variables; subscripts are names.
.It Va FILENAME
The name of the current input file.
.It Va FNR
Ordinal number of the current record in the current file.
.It Va FS
Regular expression used to separate fields; also settable
by option
.Fl F Ar fs .
.It Va NF
Number of fields in the current record.
.Va $NF
can be used to obtain the value of the last field in the current record.
.It Va NR
Ordinal number of the current record.

.Qq Li %.6g ) .
.It Va OFS
Output field separator (default blank).
.It Va ORS

.It Va RS
Input record separator (default newline).
.It Va RSTART

.Fn match
function.
.It Va SUBSEP
Separates multiple subscripts (default 034).
.El
.Sh FUNCTIONS
The awk language has a variety of built-in functions:
arithmetic, string, input/output, general, and bit-operation.
.Pp
Functions may be defined (at the position of a pattern-action statement)
thusly:
.Pp
.Dl function foo(a, b, c) { ...; return x }
.Pp
Parameters are passed by value if scalar, and by reference if array name;
functions may be called recursively.
Parameters are local to the function; all other variables are global.
Thus local variables may be created by providing excess parameters in
the function definition.
.Ss Arithmetic Functions
.Bl -tag -width "atan2(y, x)"
.It Fn atan2 y x
Return the arctangent of
.Fa y Ns / Ns Fa x
in radians.

in the string
.Fa s .
If
.Fa s
is not given,
.Va $0
is used.
An ampersand
.Pq Sq &
in
.Fa t
is replaced in string
.Fa s
with regular expression
.Fa r .
A literal ampersand can be specified by preceding it with two backslashes
.Pq Sq \e\e .
A literal backslash can be specified by preceding it with another backslash
.Pq Sq \e\e .
.Fn sub
returns the number of replacements.
.It Fn substr s m n

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification,
except
.Nm
does not support {n,m} pattern matching.
.Pp
The flags
.Op Fl \&dV
and
.Op Fl safe ,
as well as the commands
.Cm fflush , compl , and , or ,
.Cm xor , lshift , rshift ,
are extensions to that specification.
.Sh HISTORY
An
.Nm
utility appeared in
.At v7 .
.Sh BUGS
There are no explicit conversions between numbers and strings.
To force an expression to be treated as a number add 0 to it;
to force it to be treated as a string concatenate
.Li \&""
to it.
.Pp
The scope rules for variables in functions are a botch;
the syntax is worse.
