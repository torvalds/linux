.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ftv9K
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility uncompresses files compressed by
.Xr compress 1
and recompresses them with
.Xr gzip 1 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Overwrite existing
.Sq .gz
files.
Unless this option is specified,
.Nm
refuses to overwrite existing files.
.It Fl t
Test integrity of the gzipped file before deleting the original file.
If the integrity check fails, the original
.Sq .Z
file is not removed.
.It Fl v
Print a report specifying the achieved compression ratios.
.It Fl 9
Use the -9 mode of
.Xr gzip 1 ,
achieving better compression at the cost of slower execution.
.It Fl K
Keep the original
.Sq .Z
file if it uses less disk blocks than the gzipped one.
A disk block is 1024 bytes.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gzip 1
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
utility tries to maintain the file mode of the original file.
If the original file is not writable, it is not able to do that and
.Nm
will print a warning.
