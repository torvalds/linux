.Sh NAME
.Nm gzexe
.Nd create auto-decompressing executables
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm gzexe
.Op Fl d
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility uses
.Xr gzip 1
to compress executables, producing executables that decompress on-the-fly
when executed.
This saves disk space, at the cost of slower execution times.
The original executables are saved by copying each of them to a file with
the same name with a
.Sq ~
suffix appended.
After verifying that the compressed executables work as expected, the backup
files can be removed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Decompress executables previously compressed by
.Nm .
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
program refuses to compress non-regular or non-executable files,
files with a setuid or setgid bit set, files that are already
compressed using
.Nm
or programs it needs to perform on-the-fly decompression:
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr mktemp 1 ,
.Xr rm 1 ,
.Xr echo 1 ,
.Xr tail 1 ,
.Xr gzip 1 ,
and
.Xr chmod 1 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gzip 1
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
utility replaces files by overwriting them with the generated
compressed executable.
To be able to do this, it is required that the original files are writable.
