.Nd decrypt caesar ciphers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar rotation
.Nm rot13
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility attempts to decrypt caesar ciphers using English letter frequency
statistics.
.Nm Caesar
reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output.
.Pp
The optional numerical argument
.Ar rotation
may be used to specify a specific rotation value.
If invoked as
.Nm rot13 ,
a rotation value of 13 will be used.
.Pp
The frequency (from most common to least) of English letters is as follows:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent

.Ed
.Pp
Their frequencies as a percentage are as follows:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
E(13), T(10.5), A(8.1), O(7.9), N(7.1), R(6.8), I(6.3), S(6.1), H(5.2),
D(3.8), L(3.4), F(2.9), C(2.7), M(2.5), U(2.4), G(2),

Rotated postings to
.Tn USENET
and some of the databases used by the
