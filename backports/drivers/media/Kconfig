config BACKPORT_MEDIA_ANALOG_TV_SUPPORT
	bool "Analog TV support"
	depends on !MEDIA_ANALOG_TV_SUPPORT
	---help---
	  Enable analog TV support.

	  Say Y when you have a TV board with analog support or with a
	  hybrid analog/digital TV chipset.

	  Note: There are several DVB cards that are based on chips that
		support both analog and digital TV. Disabling this option
		will disable support for them.

config BACKPORT_MEDIA_DIGITAL_TV_SUPPORT
	bool "Digital TV support"

	  Enable digital TV support.

	  Say Y when you have a board with digital support or a board with
	  hybrid digital TV and analog TV.

config BACKPORT_MEDIA_RADIO_SUPPORT
	bool "AM/FM radio receivers/transmitters support"
	depends on !MEDIA_RADIO_SUPPORT
	---help---
	  Enable AM/FM radio support.

	  Additional info and docs are available on the web at

	  Say Y when you have a board with radio support.

	  Note: There are several TV cards that are based on chips that
		support radio reception. Disabling this option will
		disable support for them.

config BACKPORT_MEDIA_SDR_SUPPORT

	  Say Y when you have a software defined radio device.

config BACKPORT_MEDIA_RC_SUPPORT
	bool "Remote Controller support"

	depends on INPUT
	---help---
	  Enable support for Remote Controllers on Linux. This is
	  needed in order to support several video capture adapters,
	  standalone IR receivers/transmitters, and RF receivers.

	  Enable this option if you have a video capture board even
	  if you don't need IR, as otherwise, you may not be able to
	  compile the driver for your adapter.

	  Say Y when you have a TV or an IR device.

	  Enable the media controller API used to query media devices internal
	  topology and configure it dynamically.

	  This API is mostly used by camera interfaces in embedded platforms.

	  This option enables DVB Network Support which is a part of the DVB
	  standard. It is used, for example, by automatic firmware updates used
	  on Set-Top-Boxes. It can also be used to access the Internet via the
	  DVB card, if the network provider supports it.

	  You may want to disable the network support on embedded devices. If
	  unsure say Y.

	  By default, a media driver auto-selects all possible ancillary
	  devices such as tuners, sensors, video encoders/decoders and
	  frontends, that are used by any of the supported devices.

	  This is generally the right thing to do, except when there
	  are strict constraints with regards to the kernel size,
	  like on embedded systems.

	  Use this option with care, as deselecting ancillary drivers which
	  are, in fact, necessary will result in the lack of the needed
	  functionality for your device (it may not tune or may not have
	  the needed demodulators).

	  If unsure say Y.
