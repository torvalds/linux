	select BACKPORT_IR_IMG_HW if !IR_IMG_RAW
	help
	   Say Y or M here if you want to use the ImgTec infrared decoder
	   functionality found in SoCs such as TZ1090.

config BACKPORT_IR_IMG_RAW
	bool "Raw decoder"
	depends on !IR_IMG_RAW
	depends on BACKPORT_IR_IMG
	help
	   Say Y here to enable the raw mode driver which passes raw IR signal
	   changes to the IR raw decoders for software decoding. This is much
	   less reliable (due to lack of timestamps) and consumes more
	   processing power than using hardware decode, but can be useful for
	   testing, debug, and to make more protocols available.

config BACKPORT_IR_IMG_HW
	bool "Hardware decoder"
	depends on !IR_IMG_HW
	depends on BACKPORT_IR_IMG
	help
	   Say Y here to enable the hardware decode driver which decodes the IR
	   signals in hardware. This is more reliable, consumes less processing
	   power since only a single interrupt is received for each scancode,
	   and allows an IR scancode to be used as a wake event.

config BACKPORT_IR_IMG_NEC
	bool "NEC protocol support"
	depends on !IR_IMG_NEC
	depends on BACKPORT_IR_IMG_HW
	help
	   Say Y here to enable support for the NEC, extended NEC, and 32-bit
	   NEC protocols in the ImgTec infrared decoder block.

config BACKPORT_IR_IMG_JVC
	bool "JVC protocol support"
	depends on !IR_IMG_JVC
	depends on BACKPORT_IR_IMG_HW
	help
	   Say Y here to enable support for the JVC protocol in the ImgTec
	   infrared decoder block.

config BACKPORT_IR_IMG_SONY
	bool "Sony protocol support"
	depends on !IR_IMG_SONY
	depends on BACKPORT_IR_IMG_HW
	help
	   Say Y here to enable support for the Sony protocol in the ImgTec
	   infrared decoder block.

config BACKPORT_IR_IMG_SHARP
	bool "Sharp protocol support"
	depends on !IR_IMG_SHARP
	depends on BACKPORT_IR_IMG_HW
	help
	   Say Y here to enable support for the Sharp protocol in the ImgTec
	   infrared decoder block.

config BACKPORT_IR_IMG_SANYO
	bool "Sanyo protocol support"
	depends on !IR_IMG_SANYO
	depends on BACKPORT_IR_IMG_HW
	help
	   Say Y here to enable support for the Sanyo protocol (used by Sanyo,
	   Aiwa, Chinon remotes) in the ImgTec infrared decoder block.
