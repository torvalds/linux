config BACKPORT_NET_VENDOR_INTEL
	bool "Intel devices"
	depends on !NET_VENDOR_INTEL
	default y
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Intel cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.
