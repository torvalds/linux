	  A driver for 802.11b wireless cards based on the "Hermes" or
	  Intersil HFA384x (Prism 2) MAC controller.  This includes the vast
	  majority of the PCMCIA 802.11b cards (which are nearly all rebadges)
	  - except for the Cisco/Aironet cards.  Cards supported include the
	  Apple Airport (not a PCMCIA card), WavelanIEEE/Orinoco,
	  Cabletron/EnteraSys Roamabout, ELSA AirLancer, MELCO Buffalo, Avaya,
	  IBM High Rate Wireless, Farralon Syyline, Samsung MagicLAN, Netgear
	  MA401, LinkSys WPC-11, D-Link DWL-650, 3Com AirConnect, Intel
	  IPW2011, and Symbol Spectrum24 High Rate amongst others.

	  This option includes the guts of the driver, but in order to
	  actually use a card you will also need to enable support for PCMCIA
	  Hermes cards, PLX9052 based PCI adaptors or the Apple Airport below.

	  You will also very likely also need the Wireless Tools in order to
	  configure your card and that /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts works :

	---help---

	  Say Y to enable support for Prism 2 and 2.5 chipsets.  These
	  chipsets are better handled by the hostap driver.  This driver
	  would not support WPA or firmware download for Prism chipset.

	  If you are not sure, say N.

	default y
	---help---
	  Say Y to cache any firmware required by the Hermes drivers
	  on startup.  The firmware will remain cached until the
	  driver is unloaded.  The cache uses 64K of RAM.

	  Otherwise load the firmware from userspace as required.  In
	  this case the driver should be unloaded and restarted
	  whenever the firmware is changed.

	  If you are not sure, say Y.

config BACKPORT_APPLE_AIRPORT

	help
	  Say Y here to support the Airport 802.11b wireless Ethernet hardware
	  built into the Macintosh iBook and other recent PowerPC-based
	  Macintosh machines. This is essentially a Lucent Orinoco card with
	  a non-standard interface.

	  This driver does not support the Airport Extreme (802.11b/g). Use
	  the BCM43xx driver for Airport Extreme cards.

	  Enable support for PCMCIA cards supported by the "Hermes" (aka
	  orinoco) driver when used in PLX9052 based PCI adaptors.  These
	  adaptors are not a full PCMCIA controller but act as a more limited
	  PCI <-> PCMCIA bridge.  Several vendors sell such adaptors so that
	  802.11b PCMCIA cards can be used in desktop machines.  The Netgear
	  MA301 is such an adaptor.

	  Enable support for PCI and mini-PCI 802.11b wireless NICs based on
	  the Prism 2.5 chipset.  These are true PCI cards, not the 802.11b
	  PCMCIA cards bundled with PCI<->PCMCIA adaptors which are also
	  common.  Some of the built-in wireless adaptors in laptops are of
	  this variety.

	  A driver for "Hermes" chipset based PCMCIA wireless adaptors, such
	  as the Lucent WavelanIEEE/Orinoco cards and their OEM (Cabletron/
	  EnteraSys RoamAbout 802.11, ELSA Airlancer, Melco Buffalo and
	  others).  It should also be usable on various Prism II based cards
	  such as the Linksys, D-Link and Farallon Skyline.  It should also
	  work on Symbol cards such as the 3Com AirConnect and Ericsson BACKPORT_WLAN.

	  You will very likely need the Wireless Tools in order to

	  This is a driver for 802.11b cards using RAM-loadable Symbol
	  firmware, such as Symbol Wireless Networker LA4100, CompactFlash
	  cards by Socket Communications and Intel PRO/Wireless 2011B.

	  This driver requires firmware download on startup.  Utilities
