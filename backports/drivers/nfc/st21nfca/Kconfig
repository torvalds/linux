	  STMicroelectronics ST21NFCA core driver. It implements the chipset
	  HCI logic and hooks into the BACKPORT_NFC kernel APIs. Physical layers will
	  register against it.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose m here. The module will
	  be called st21nfca.
	  Say N if unsure.

	  This module adds support for the STMicroelectronics st21nfca i2c interface.
	  Select this if your platform is using the i2c bus.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called st21nfca_i2c.
	  Say N if unsure.
