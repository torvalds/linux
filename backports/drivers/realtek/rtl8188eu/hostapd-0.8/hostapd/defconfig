# Example hostapd build time configuration
#
# This file lists the configuration options that are used when building the
# hostapd binary. All lines starting with # are ignored. Configuration option
# lines must be commented out complete, if they are not to be included, i.e.,
# just setting VARIABLE=n is not disabling that variable.
#
# This file is included in Makefile, so variables like CFLAGS and LIBS can also
# be modified from here. In most cass, these lines should use += in order not
# to override previous values of the variables.

# hostapd depends on strong random number generation being available from the
# operating system. os_get_random() function is used to fetch random data when
# needed, e.g., for key generation. On Linux and BSD systems, this works by
# reading /dev/urandom. It should be noted that the OS entropy pool needs to be
# properly initialized before hostapd is started. This is important especially
# on embedded devices that do not have a hardware random number generator and
# may by default start up with minimal entropy available for random number
# generation.
#
# As a safety net, hostapd is by default trying to internally collect
# additional entropy for generating random data to mix in with the data
# fetched from the OS. This by itself is not considered to be very strong, but
# it may help in cases where the system pool is not initialized properly.
# However, it is very strongly recommended that the system pool is initialized
# with enough entropy either by using hardware assisted random number
# generatior or by storing state over device reboots.
#
# If the os_get_random() is known to provide strong ramdom data (e.g., on
# Linux/BSD, the board in question is known to have reliable source of random
# data from /dev/urandom), the internal hostapd random pool can be disabled.
# This will save some in binary size and CPU use. However, this should only be
# considered for builds that are known to be used on devices that meet the
# requirements described above.
#CONFIG_NO_RANDOM_POOL=y
