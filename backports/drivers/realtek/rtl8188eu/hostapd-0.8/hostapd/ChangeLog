ChangeLog for hostapd

2010-04-18 - v0.7.2
	* fix WPS internal Registrar use when an external Registrar is also
	  active
	* bsd: Cleaned up driver wrapper and added various low-level
	  configuration options
	* TNC: fixed issues with fragmentation
	* EAP-TNC: add Flags field into fragment acknowledgement (needed to
	  interoperate with other implementations; may potentially breaks
	  compatibility with older wpa_supplicant/hostapd versions)
	* cleaned up driver wrapper API for multi-BSS operations
	* nl80211: fix multi-BSS and VLAN operations
	* fix number of issues with IEEE 802.11r/FT; this version is not
	  backwards compatible with old versions
	* add SA Query Request processing in AP mode (IEEE 802.11w)
	* fix IGTK PN in group rekeying (IEEE 802.11w)
	* fix WPS PBC session overlap detection to use correct attribute
	* hostapd_notif_Assoc() can now be called with all IEs to simplify
	  driver wrappers
	* work around interoperability issue with some WPS External Registrar
	  implementations
	* nl80211: fix WPS IE update
	* hostapd_cli: add support for action script operations (run a script
	  on hostapd events)
	* fix DH padding with internal crypto code (mainly, for WPS)
	* fix WPS association with both WPS IE and WPA/RSN IE present with
	  driver wrappers that use hostapd MLME (e.g., nl80211)

2010-01-16 - v0.7.1
	* cleaned up driver wrapper API (struct wpa_driver_ops); the new API
	  is not fully backwards compatible, so out-of-tree driver wrappers
	  will need modifications
	* cleaned up various module interfaces
	* merge hostapd and wpa_supplicant developers' documentation into a
	  single document
	* fixed HT Capabilities IE with nl80211 drivers
	* moved generic AP functionality code into src/ap
	* WPS: handle Selected Registrar as union of info from all Registrars
	* remove obsolte Prism54.org driver wrapper
	* added internal debugging mechanism with backtrace support and memory
	  allocation/freeing validation, etc. tests (CONFIG_WPA_TRACE=y)
	* EAP-FAST server: piggyback Phase 2 start with the end of Phase 1
	* WPS: add support for dynamically selecting whether to provision the
	  PSK as an ASCII passphrase or PSK
	* added support for WDS (4-address frame) mode with per-station virtual
	  interfaces (wds_sta=1 in config file; only supported with
	  driver=nl80211 for now)
	* fixed WPS Probe Request processing to handle missing required
	  attribute
	* fixed PKCS#12 use with OpenSSL 1.0.0
	* detect bridge interface automatically so that bridge parameter in
	  hostapd.conf becomes optional (though, it may now be used to
	  automatically add then WLAN interface into a bridge with
	  driver=nl80211)

2009-11-21 - v0.7.0
	* increased hostapd_cli ping interval to 5 seconds and made this
	  configurable with a new command line options (-G<seconds>)
	* driver_nl80211: use Linux socket filter to improve performance
	* added support for external Registrars with WPS (UPnP transport)
	* 802.11n: scan for overlapping BSSes before starting 20/40 MHz channel
	* driver_nl80211: fixed STA accounting data collection (TX/RX bytes
	  reported correctly; TX/RX packets not yet available from kernel)
	* added support for WPS USBA out-of-band mechanism with USB Flash
	  Drives (UFD) (CONFIG_WPS_UFD=y)
	* fixed EAPOL/EAP reauthentication when using an external RADIUS
	  authentication server
	* fixed TNC with EAP-TTLS
	* fixed IEEE 802.11r key derivation function to match with the standard
	  (note: this breaks interoperability with previous version) [Bug 303]
	* fixed SHA-256 based key derivation function to match with the
	  standard when using CCMP (for IEEE 802.11r and IEEE 802.11w)
	  (note: this breaks interoperability with previous version) [Bug 307]
	* added number of code size optimizations to remove unnecessary
	  functionality from the program binary based on build configuration
	  (part of this automatic; part configurable with CONFIG_NO_* build
	  options)
	* use shared driver wrapper files with wpa_supplicant
	* driver_nl80211: multiple updates to provide support for new Linux
	  nl80211/mac80211 functionality
	* updated management frame protection to use IEEE Std 802.11w-2009
	* fixed number of small WPS issues and added workarounds to
	  interoperate with common deployed broken implementations
	* added some IEEE 802.11n co-existance rules to disable 40 MHz channels
	  or modify primary/secondary channels if needed based on neighboring
	  networks
	* added support for NFC out-of-band mechanism with WPS
	* added preliminary support for IEEE 802.11r RIC processing

2009-01-06 - v0.6.7
	* added support for Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)
	  (hostapd can now be configured to act as an integrated WPS Registrar
	  and provision credentials for WPS Enrollees using PIN and PBC
	  methods; external wireless Registrar can configure the AP, but
	  external WLAN Manager Registrars are not supported); WPS support can
	  be enabled by adding CONFIG_WPS=y into .config and setting the
	  runtime configuration variables in hostapd.conf (see WPS section in
	  the example configuration file); new hostapd_cli commands wps_pin and
	  wps_pbc are used to configure WPS negotiation; see README-WPS for
	  more details
	* added IEEE 802.11n HT capability configuration (ht_capab)
	* added support for generating Country IE based on nl80211 regulatory
	  information (added if ieee80211d=1 in configuration)
	* fixed WEP authentication (both Open System and Shared Key) with
	  mac80211
	* added support for EAP-AKA' (draft-arkko-eap-aka-kdf)
	* added support for using driver_test over UDP socket
	* changed EAP-GPSK to use the IANA assigned EAP method type 51
	* updated management frame protection to use IEEE 802.11w/D7.0
	* fixed retransmission of EAP requests if no response is received

2008-11-23 - v0.6.6
	* added a new configuration option, wpa_ptk_rekey, that can be used to
	  enforce frequent PTK rekeying, e.g., to mitigate some attacks against
	  TKIP deficiencies
	* updated OpenSSL code for EAP-FAST to use an updated version of the
	  session ticket overriding API that was included into the upstream
	  OpenSSL 0.9.9 tree on 2008-11-15 (no additional OpenSSL patch is
	  needed with that version anymore)
	* changed channel flags configuration to read the information from
	  the driver (e.g., via driver_nl80211 when using mac80211) instead of
	  using hostapd as the source of the regulatory information (i.e.,
	  information from CRDA is now used with mac80211); this allows 5 GHz
	  channels to be used with hostapd (if allowed in the current
	  regulatory domain)
	* fixed EAP-TLS message processing for the last TLS message if it is
	  large enough to require fragmentation (e.g., if a large Session
	  Ticket data is included)
	* fixed listen interval configuration for nl80211 drivers

2008-11-01 - v0.6.5
	* added support for SHA-256 as X.509 certificate digest when using the
	  internal X.509/TLSv1 implementation
	* fixed EAP-FAST PAC-Opaque padding (0.6.4 broke this for some peer
	  identity lengths)
	* fixed internal TLSv1 implementation for abbreviated handshake (used
	  by EAP-FAST server)
	* added support for setting VLAN ID for STAs based on local MAC ACL
	  (accept_mac_file) as an alternative for RADIUS server-based
	  configuration
	* updated management frame protection to use IEEE 802.11w/D6.0
	  (adds a new association ping to protect against unauthenticated
	  authenticate or (re)associate request frames dropping association)
	* added support for using SHA256-based stronger key derivation for WPA2
	  (IEEE 802.11w)
	* added new "driver wrapper" for RADIUS-only configuration
	  (driver=none in hostapd.conf; CONFIG_DRIVER_NONE=y in .config)
	* fixed WPA/RSN IE validation to verify that the proto (WPA vs. WPA2)
	  is enabled in configuration
	* changed EAP-FAST configuration to use separate fields for A-ID and
	  A-ID-Info (eap_fast_a_id_info) to allow A-ID to be set to a fixed
	  16-octet len binary value for better interoperability with some peer
	  implementations; eap_fast_a_id is now configured as a hex string
	* driver_nl80211: Updated to match the current Linux mac80211 AP mode
	  configuration (wireless-testing.git and Linux kernel releases
	  starting from 2.6.29)

2008-08-10 - v0.6.4
	* added peer identity into EAP-FAST PAC-Opaque and skip Phase 2
	  Identity Request if identity is already known
	* added support for EAP Sequences in EAP-FAST Phase 2
	* added support for EAP-TNC (Trusted Network Connect)
	  (this version implements the EAP-TNC method and EAP-TTLS/EAP-FAST
	  changes needed to run two methods in sequence (IF-T) and the IF-IMV
	  and IF-TNCCS interfaces from TNCS)
	* added support for optional cryptobinding with PEAPv0
	* added fragmentation support for EAP-TNC
	* added support for fragmenting EAP-TTLS/PEAP/FAST Phase 2 (tunneled)
	  data
	* added support for opportunistic key caching (OKC)

2008-02-22 - v0.6.3
	* fixed Reassociation Response callback processing when using internal
	  MLME (driver_{hostap,nl80211,test}.c)
	* updated FT support to use the latest draft, IEEE 802.11r/D9.0
	* copy optional Proxy-State attributes into RADIUS response when acting
	  as a RADIUS authentication server
	* fixed EAPOL state machine to handle a case in which no response is
	  received from the RADIUS authentication server; previous version
	  could have triggered a crash in some cases after a timeout
	* fixed EAP-SIM/AKA realm processing to allow decorated usernames to
	  be used
	* added a workaround for EAP-SIM/AKA peers that include incorrect null
	  termination in the username
	* fixed EAP-SIM/AKA protected result indication to include AT_COUNTER
	  attribute in notification messages only when using fast
	  reauthentication
	* fixed EAP-SIM Start response processing for fast reauthentication
	  case
	* added support for pending EAP processing in EAP-{PEAP,TTLS,FAST}
	  phase 2 to allow EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA to be used as the Phase 2 method

2008-01-01 - v0.6.2
	* fixed EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA message parser to validate attribute
	  lengths properly to avoid potential crash caused by invalid messages
	* added data structure for storing allocated buffers (struct wpabuf);
	  this does not affect hostapd usage, but many of the APIs changed
	  and various interfaces (e.g., EAP) is not compatible with old
	  versions
	* added support for protecting EAP-AKA/Identity messages with
	  AT_CHECKCODE (optional feature in RFC 4187)
	* added support for protected result indication with AT_RESULT_IND for
	  EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA (eap_sim_aka_result_ind=1)
	* added support for configuring EAP-TTLS phase 2 non-EAP methods in
	  EAP server configuration; previously all four were enabled for every
	  phase 2 user, now all four are disabled by default and need to be
	  enabled with new method names TTLS-PAP, TTLS-CHAP, TTLS-MSCHAP,
	  TTLS-MSCHAPV2
	* removed old debug printing mechanism and the related 'debug'
	  parameter in the configuration file; debug verbosity is now set with
	  -d (or -dd) command line arguments
	* added support for EAP-IKEv2 (draft-tschofenig-eap-ikev2-15.txt);
	  only shared key/password authentication is supported in this version

2007-11-24 - v0.6.1
	* added experimental, integrated TLSv1 server implementation with the
	  needed X.509/ASN.1/RSA/bignum processing (this can be enabled by
	  setting CONFIG_TLS=internal and CONFIG_INTERNAL_LIBTOMMATH=y in
	  .config); this can be useful, e.g., if the target system does not
	  have a suitable TLS library and a minimal code size is required
	* added support for EAP-FAST server method to the integrated EAP
	  server
	* updated EAP Generalized Pre-Shared Key (EAP-GPSK) to use the latest
	  draft (draft-ietf-emu-eap-gpsk-07.txt)
	* added a new configuration parameter, rsn_pairwise, to allow different
	  pairwise cipher suites to be enabled for WPA and RSN/WPA2
	  (note: if wpa_pairwise differs from rsn_pairwise, the driver will
	  either need to support this or will have to use the WPA/RSN IEs from
	  hostapd; currently, the included madwifi and bsd driver interfaces do
	  not have support for this)
	* updated FT support to use the latest draft, IEEE 802.11r/D8.0

2007-05-28 - v0.6.0
	* added experimental IEEE 802.11r/D6.0 support
	* updated EAP-SAKE to RFC 4763 and the IANA-allocated EAP type 48
	* updated EAP-PSK to use the IANA-allocated EAP type 47
	* fixed EAP-PSK bit ordering of the Flags field
	* fixed configuration reloading (SIGHUP) to re-initialize WPA PSKs
	  by reading wpa_psk_file [Bug 181]
	* fixed EAP-TTLS AVP parser processing for too short AVP lengths
	* fixed IPv6 connection to RADIUS accounting server
	* updated EAP Generalized Pre-Shared Key (EAP-GPSK) to use the latest
	  draft (draft-ietf-emu-eap-gpsk-04.txt)
	* hlr_auc_gw: read GSM triplet file into memory and rotate through the
	  entries instead of only using the same three triplets every time
	  (this does not work properly with tests using multiple clients, but
	  provides bit better triplet data for testing a single client; anyway,
	  if a better quality triplets are needed, GSM-Milenage should be used
	  instead of hardcoded triplet file)
	* fixed EAP-MSCHAPv2 server to use a space between S and M parameters
	  in Success Request [Bug 203]
	* added support for sending EAP-AKA Notifications in error cases
	* updated to use IEEE 802.11w/D2.0 for management frame protection
	  (still experimental)
	* RADIUS server: added support for processing duplicate messages
	  (retransmissions from RADIUS client) by replying with the previous
	  reply

2006-11-24 - v0.5.6
	* added support for configuring and controlling multiple BSSes per
	  radio interface (bss=<ifname> in hostapd.conf); this is only
	  available with Devicescape and test driver interfaces
	* fixed PMKSA cache update in the end of successful RSN
	  pre-authentication
	* added support for dynamic VLAN configuration (i.e., selecting VLAN-ID
	  for each STA based on RADIUS Access-Accept attributes); this requires
	  VLAN support from the kernel driver/802.11 stack and this is
	  currently only available with Devicescape and test driver interfaces
	* driver_madwifi: fixed configuration of unencrypted modes (plaintext
	  and IEEE 802.1X without WEP)
	* removed STAKey handshake since PeerKey handshake has replaced it in
	  IEEE 802.11ma and there are no known deployments of STAKey
	* updated EAP Generalized Pre-Shared Key (EAP-GPSK) to use the latest
	  draft (draft-ietf-emu-eap-gpsk-01.txt)
	* added preliminary implementation of IEEE 802.11w/D1.0 (management
	  frame protection)
	  (Note: this requires driver support to work properly.)
	  (Note2: IEEE 802.11w is an unapproved draft and subject to change.)
	* hlr_auc_gw: added support for GSM-Milenage (for EAP-SIM)
	* hlr_auc_gw: added support for reading per-IMSI Milenage keys and
	  parameters from a text file to make it possible to implement proper
	  GSM/UMTS authentication server for multiple SIM/USIM cards using
	  EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA
	* fixed session timeout processing with drivers that do not use
	  ieee802_11.c (e.g., madwifi)

2006-08-27 - v0.5.5
	* added 'hostapd_cli new_sta <addr>' command for adding a new STA into
	  hostapd (e.g., to initialize wired network authentication based on an
	  external signal)
	* fixed hostapd to add PMKID KDE into 4-Way Handshake Message 1 when
	  using WPA2 even if PMKSA caching is not used
	* added -P<pid file> argument for hostapd to write the current process
	  id into a file
	* added support for RADIUS Authentication Server MIB (RFC 2619)

2006-06-20 - v0.5.4
	* fixed nt_password_hash build [Bug 144]
	* added PeerKey handshake implementation for IEEE 802.11e
	  direct link setup (DLS) to replace STAKey handshake
	* added support for EAP Generalized Pre-Shared Key (EAP-GPSK,
	  draft-clancy-emu-eap-shared-secret-00.txt)
	* fixed a segmentation fault when RSN pre-authentication was completed
	  successfully [Bug 152]

2006-04-27 - v0.5.3
	* do not build nt_password_hash and hlr_auc_gw by default to avoid
	  requiring a TLS library for a successful build; these programs can be
	  build with 'make nt_password_hash' and 'make hlr_auc_gw'
	* added a new configuration option, eapol_version, that can be used to
	  set EAPOL version to 1 (default is 2) to work around broken client
	  implementations that drop EAPOL frames which use version number 2
	  [Bug 89]
	* added support for EAP-SAKE (no EAP method number allocated yet, so
	  this is using the same experimental type 255 as EAP-PSK)
	* fixed EAP-MSCHAPv2 message length validation

2006-03-19 - v0.5.2
	* fixed stdarg use in hostapd_logger(): if both stdout and syslog
	  logging was enabled, hostapd could trigger a segmentation fault in
	  vsyslog on some CPU -- C library combinations
	* moved HLR/AuC gateway implementation for EAP-SIM/AKA into an external
	  program to make it easier to use for implementing real SS7 gateway;
	  eap_sim_db is not anymore used as a file name for GSM authentication
	  triplets; instead, it is path to UNIX domain socket that will be used
	  to communicate with the external gateway program (e.g., hlr_auc_gw)
	* added example HLR/AuC gateway implementation, hlr_auc_gw, that uses
	  local information (GSM authentication triplets from a text file and
	  hardcoded AKA authentication data); this can be used to test EAP-SIM
	  and EAP-AKA
	* added Milenage algorithm (example 3GPP AKA algorithm) to hlr_auc_gw
	  to make it possible to test EAP-AKA with real USIM cards (this is
	  disabled by default; define AKA_USE_MILENAGE when building hlr_auc_gw
	  to enable this)
	* driver_madwifi: added support for getting station RSN IE from
	  madwifi-ng svn r1453 and newer; this fixes RSN that was apparently
	  broken with earlier change (r1357) in the driver
	* changed EAP method registration to use a dynamic list of methods
	  instead of a static list generated at build time
	* fixed WPA message 3/4 not to encrypt Key Data field (WPA IE)
	  [Bug 125]
	* added ap_max_inactivity configuration parameter

2006-01-29 - v0.5.1
	* driver_test: added better support for multiple APs and STAs by using
	  a directory with sockets that include MAC address for each device in
	  the name (test_socket=DIR:/tmp/test)
	* added support for EAP expanded type (vendor specific EAP methods)

2005-12-18 - v0.5.0 (beginning of 0.5.x development releases)
	* added experimental STAKey handshake implementation for IEEE 802.11e
	  direct link setup (DLS); note: this is disabled by default in both
	  build and runtime configuration (can be enabled with CONFIG_STAKEY=y
	  and stakey=1)
	* added support for EAP methods to use callbacks to external programs
	  by buffering a pending request and processing it after the EAP method
	  is ready to continue
	* improved EAP-SIM database interface to allow external request to GSM
	  HLR/AuC without blocking hostapd process
	* added support for using EAP-SIM pseudonyms and fast re-authentication
	* added support for EAP-AKA in the integrated EAP authenticator
	* added support for matching EAP identity prefixes (e.g., "1"*) in EAP
	  user database to allow EAP-SIM/AKA selection without extra roundtrip
	  for EAP-Nak negotiation
	* added support for storing EAP user password as NtPasswordHash instead
	  of plaintext password when using MSCHAP or MSCHAPv2 for
	  authentication (hash:<16-octet hex value>); added nt_password_hash
	  tool for hashing password to generate NtPasswordHash

2005-11-20 - v0.4.7 (beginning of 0.4.x stable releases)
	* driver_wired: fixed EAPOL sending to optionally use PAE group address
	  as the destination instead of supplicant MAC address; this is
	  disabled by default, but should be enabled with use_pae_group_addr=1
	  in configuration file if the wired interface is used by only one
	  device at the time (common switch configuration)
	* driver_madwifi: configure driver to use TKIP countermeasures in order
	  to get correct behavior (IEEE 802.11 association failing; previously,
	  association succeeded, but hostpad forced disassociation immediately)
	* driver_madwifi: added support for madwifi-ng

2005-10-27 - v0.4.6
	* added support for replacing user identity from EAP with RADIUS
	  User-Name attribute from Access-Accept message, if that is included,
	  for the RADIUS accounting messages (e.g., for EAP-PEAP/TTLS to get
	  tunneled identity into accounting messages when the RADIUS server
	  does not support better way of doing this with Class attribute)
	* driver_madwifi: fixed EAPOL packet receive for configuration where
	  ath# is part of a bridge interface
	* added a configuration file and log analyzer script for logwatch
	* fixed EAPOL state machine step function to process all state
	  transitions before processing new events; this resolves a race
	  condition in which EAPOL-Start message could trigger hostapd to send
	  two EAP-Response/Identity frames to the authentication server

2005-09-25 - v0.4.5
	* added client CA list to the TLS certificate request in order to make
	  it easier for the client to select which certificate to use
	* added experimental support for EAP-PSK
	* added support for WE-19 (hostap, madwifi)

2005-08-21 - v0.4.4
	* fixed build without CONFIG_RSN_PREAUTH
	* fixed FreeBSD build

2005-06-26 - v0.4.3
	* fixed PMKSA caching to copy User-Name and Class attributes so that
	  RADIUS accounting gets correct information
	* start RADIUS accounting only after successful completion of WPA
	  4-Way Handshake if WPA-PSK is used
	* fixed PMKSA caching for the case where STA (re)associates without
	  first disassociating

2005-06-12 - v0.4.2
	* EAP-PAX is now registered as EAP type 46
	* fixed EAP-PAX MAC calculation
	* fixed EAP-PAX CK and ICK key derivation
	* renamed eap_authenticator configuration variable to eap_server to
	  better match with RFC 3748 (EAP) terminology
	* driver_test: added support for testing hostapd with wpa_supplicant
	  by using test driver interface without any kernel drivers or network
	  cards

2005-05-22 - v0.4.1
	* fixed RADIUS server initialization when only auth or acct server
	  is configured and the other one is left empty
	* driver_madwifi: added support for RADIUS accounting
	* driver_madwifi: added preliminary support for compiling against 'BSD'
	  branch of madwifi CVS tree
	* driver_madwifi: fixed pairwise key removal to allow WPA reauth
	  without disassociation
	* added support for reading additional certificates from PKCS#12 files
	  and adding them to the certificate chain
	* fixed RADIUS Class attribute processing to only use Access-Accept
	  packets to update Class; previously, other RADIUS authentication
	  packets could have cleared Class attribute
	* added support for more than one Class attribute in RADIUS packets
	* added support for verifying certificate revocation list (CRL) when
	  using integrated EAP authenticator for EAP-TLS; new hostapd.conf
	  options 'check_crl'; CRL must be included in the ca_cert file for now

2005-04-25 - v0.4.0 (beginning of 0.4.x development releases)
	* added support for including network information into
	  EAP-Request/Identity message (ASCII-0 (nul) in eap_message)
	  (e.g., to implement draft-adrange-eap-network-discovery-07.txt)
	* fixed a bug which caused some RSN pre-authentication cases to use
	  freed memory and potentially crash hostapd
	* fixed private key loading for cases where passphrase is not set
	* added support for sending TLS alerts and aborting authentication
	  when receiving a TLS alert
	* fixed WPA2 to add PMKSA cache entry when using integrated EAP
	  authenticator
	* fixed PMKSA caching (EAP authentication was not skipped correctly
	  with the new state machine changes from IEEE 802.1X draft)
	* added support for RADIUS over IPv6; own_ip_addr, auth_server_addr,
	  and acct_server_addr can now be IPv6 addresses (CONFIG_IPV6=y needs
	  to be added to .config to include IPv6 support); for RADIUS server,
	  radius_server_ipv6=1 needs to be set in hostapd.conf and addresses
	  in RADIUS clients file can then use IPv6 format
	* added experimental support for EAP-PAX
	* replaced hostapd control interface library (hostapd_ctrl.[ch]) with
	  the same implementation that wpa_supplicant is using (wpa_ctrl.[ch])

2005-02-12 - v0.3.7 (beginning of 0.3.x stable releases)

2005-01-23 - v0.3.5
	* added support for configuring a forced PEAP version based on the
	  Phase 1 identity
	* fixed PEAPv1 to use tunneled EAP-Success/Failure instead of EAP-TLV
	  to terminate authentication
	* fixed EAP identifier duplicate processing with the new IEEE 802.1X
	  draft
	* clear accounting data in the driver when starting a new accounting
	  session
	* driver_madwifi: filter wireless events based on ifindex to allow more
	  than one network interface to be used
	* fixed WPA message 2/4 processing not to cancel timeout for TimeoutEvt
	  setting if the packet does not pass MIC verification (e.g., due to
	  incorrect PSK); previously, message 1/4 was not tried again if an
	  invalid message 2/4 was received
	* fixed reconfiguration of RADIUS client retransmission timer when
	  adding a new message to the pending list; previously, timer was not
	  updated at this point and if there was a pending message with long
	  time for the next retry, the new message needed to wait that long for
	  its first retry, too

2005-01-09 - v0.3.4
	* added support for configuring multiple allowed EAP types for Phase 2
	  authentication (EAP-PEAP, EAP-TTLS)
	* fixed EAPOL-Start processing to trigger WPA reauthentication
	  (previously, only EAPOL authentication was done)

2005-01-02 - v0.3.3
	* added support for EAP-PEAP in the integrated EAP authenticator
	* added support for EAP-GTC in the integrated EAP authenticator
	* added support for configuring list of EAP methods for Phase 1 so that
	  the integrated EAP authenticator can, e.g., use the wildcard entry
	  for EAP-TLS and EAP-PEAP
	* added support for EAP-TTLS in the integrated EAP authenticator
	* added support for EAP-SIM in the integrated EAP authenticator
	* added support for using hostapd as a RADIUS authentication server
	  with the integrated EAP authenticator taking care of EAP
	  authentication (new hostapd.conf options: radius_server_clients and
	  radius_server_auth_port); this is not included in default build; use
	  CONFIG_RADIUS_SERVER=y in .config to include

2004-12-19 - v0.3.2
	* removed 'daemonize' configuration file option since it has not really
	  been used at all for more than year
	* driver_madwifi: fixed group key setup and added get_ssid method
	* added support for EAP-MSCHAPv2 in the integrated EAP authenticator

2004-12-12 - v0.3.1
	* added support for integrated EAP-TLS authentication (new hostapd.conf
	  variables: ca_cert, server_cert, private_key, private_key_passwd);
	  this enabled dynamic keying (WPA2/WPA/IEEE 802.1X/WEP) without
	  external RADIUS server
	* added support for reading PKCS#12 (PFX) files (as a replacement for
	  PEM/DER) to get certificate and private key (CONFIG_PKCS12)

2004-12-05 - v0.3.0 (beginning of 0.3.x development releases)
	* added support for Acct-{Input,Output}-Gigawords
	* added support for Event-Timestamp (in RADIUS Accounting-Requests)
	* added support for RADIUS Authentication Client MIB (RFC2618)
	* added support for RADIUS Accounting Client MIB (RFC2620)
	* made EAP re-authentication period configurable (eap_reauth_period)
	* fixed EAPOL reauthentication to trigger WPA/WPA2 reauthentication
	* fixed EAPOL state machine to stop if STA is removed during
	  eapol_sm_step(); this fixes at least one segfault triggering bug with
	  IEEE 802.11i pre-authentication
	* added support for multiple WPA pre-shared keys (e.g., one for each
	  client MAC address or keys shared by a group of clients);
	  new hostapd.conf field wpa_psk_file for setting path to a text file
	  containing PSKs, see hostapd.wpa_psk for an example
	* added support for multiple driver interfaces to allow hostapd to be
	  used with other drivers
	* added wired authenticator driver interface (driver=wired in
	  hostapd.conf, see wired.conf for example configuration)
	* added madwifi driver interface (driver=madwifi in hostapd.conf, see
	  madwifi.conf for example configuration; Note: include files from
	  madwifi project is needed for building and a configuration file,
	  .config, needs to be created in hostapd directory with
	  CONFIG_DRIVER_MADWIFI=y to include this driver interface in hostapd
	  build)
	* fixed an alignment issue that could cause SHA-1 to fail on some
	  platforms (e.g., Intel ixp425 with a compiler that does not 32-bit
	  align variables)
	* fixed RADIUS reconnection after an error in sending interim
	  accounting packets
	* added hostapd control interface for external programs and an example
	  CLI, hostapd_cli (like wpa_cli for wpa_supplicant)
	* started adding dot11, dot1x, radius MIBs ('hostapd_cli mib',
	  'hostapd_cli sta <addr>')
	* finished update from IEEE 802.1X-2001 to IEEE 802.1X-REV (now d11)
	* added support for strict GTK rekeying (wpa_strict_rekey in
	  hostapd.conf)
	* updated IAPP to use UDP port 3517 and multicast address 224.0.1.178
	  (instead of broadcast) for IAPP ADD-notify (moved from draft 3 to
	  IEEE 802.11F-2003)
	* added Prism54 driver interface (driver=prism54 in hostapd.conf;
	  note: .config needs to be created in hostapd directory with
	  CONFIG_DRIVER_PRISM54=y to include this driver interface in hostapd
	  build)
	* dual-licensed hostapd (GPLv2 and BSD licenses)
	* fixed RADIUS accounting to generate a new session id for cases where
	  a station reassociates without first being complete deauthenticated
	* fixed STA disassociation handler to mark next timeout state to
	  deauthenticate the station, i.e., skip long wait for inactivity poll
	  and extra disassociation, if the STA disassociates without
	  deauthenticating
	* added integrated EAP authenticator that can be used instead of
	  external RADIUS authentication server; currently, only EAP-MD5 is
	  supported, so this cannot yet be used for key distribution; the EAP
	  method interface is generic, though, so adding new EAP methods should
	  be straightforward; new hostapd.conf variables: 'eap_authenticator'
	  and 'eap_user_file'; this obsoletes "minimal authentication server"
	  ('minimal_eap' in hostapd.conf) which is now removed
	* added support for FreeBSD and driver interface for the BSD net80211
	  layer (driver=bsd in hostapd.conf and CONFIG_DRIVER_BSD=y in
	  .config); please note that some of the required kernel mods have not
	  yet been committed

2004-07-17 - v0.2.4 (beginning of 0.2.x stable releases)
	* fixed some accounting cases where Accounting-Start was sent when
	  IEEE 802.1X port was being deauthorized

2004-06-20 - v0.2.3
	* modified RADIUS client to re-connect the socket in case of certain
	  error codes that are generated when a network interface state is
	  changes (e.g., when IP address changes or the interface is set UP)
	* fixed couple of cases where EAPOL state for a station was freed
	  twice causing a segfault for hostapd
	* fixed couple of bugs in processing WPA deauthentication (freed data
	  was used)

2004-05-31 - v0.2.2
	* fixed WPA/WPA2 group rekeying to use key index correctly (GN/GM)
	* fixed group rekeying to send zero TSC in EAPOL-Key messages to fix
	  cases where STAs dropped multicast frames as replay attacks
	* added support for copying RADIUS Attribute 'Class' from
	  authentication messages into accounting messages
	* send canned EAP failure if RADIUS server sends Access-Reject without
	  EAP message (previously, Supplicant was not notified in this case)
	* fixed mixed WPA-PSK and WPA-EAP mode to work with WPA-PSK (i.e., do
	  not start EAPOL state machines if the STA selected to use WPA-PSK)

2004-05-06 - v0.2.1
	* added WPA and IEEE 802.11i/RSN (WPA2) Authenticator functionality
	  - based on IEEE 802.11i/D10.0 but modified to interoperate with WPA
	    (i.e., IEEE 802.11i/D3.0)
	  - supports WPA-only, RSN-only, and mixed WPA/RSN mode
	  - both WPA-PSK and WPA-RADIUS/EAP are supported
	  - PMKSA caching and pre-authentication
	  - new hostapd.conf variables: wpa, wpa_psk, wpa_passphrase,
	    wpa_key_mgmt, wpa_pairwise, wpa_group_rekey, wpa_gmk_rekey,
	    rsn_preauth, rsn_preauth_interfaces
	* fixed interim accounting to remove any pending accounting messages
	  to the STA before sending a new one

2004-02-15 - v0.2.0
	* added support for Acct-Interim-Interval:
	  - draft-ietf-radius-acct-interim-01.txt
	  - use Acct-Interim-Interval attribute from Access-Accept if local
	    'radius_acct_interim_interval' is not set
	  - allow different update intervals for each STA
	* fixed event loop to call signal handlers only after returning from
	  the real signal handler
	* reset sta->timeout_next after successful association to make sure
	  that the previously registered inactivity timer will not remove the
	  STA immediately (e.g., if STA deauthenticates and re-associates
	  before the timer is triggered).
	* added new hostapd.conf variable, nas_identifier, that can be used to
	  add an optional RADIUS Attribute, NAS-Identifier, into authentication
	  and accounting messages
	* added support for Accounting-On and Accounting-Off messages
	* fixed accounting session handling to send Accounting-Start only once
	  per session and not to send Accounting-Stop if the session was not
	  initialized properly
	* fixed Accounting-Stop statistics in cases where the message was
	  previously sent after the kernel entry for the STA (and/or IEEE
	  802.1X data) was removed


Note:

Older changes up to and including v0.1.0 are included in the ChangeLog
of the Host AP driver.
