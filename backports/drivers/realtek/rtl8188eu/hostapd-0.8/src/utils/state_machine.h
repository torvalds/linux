 * implement a state machine. In addition to including this header file, each
 * file implementing a state machine must define STATE_MACHINE_DATA to be the
 * data structure including state variables (enum machine_state,
 * Boolean changed), and STATE_MACHINE_DEBUG_PREFIX to be a string that is used
 * as a prefix for all debug messages. If SM_ENTRY_MA macro is used to define
 * a group of state machines with shared data structure, STATE_MACHINE_ADDR
 * needs to be defined to point to the MAC address used in debug output.
 * SM_ENTRY_M macro can be used to define similar group of state machines
 * without this additional debug info.
