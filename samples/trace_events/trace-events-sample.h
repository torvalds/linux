 * name: name of the trace point. This is also how to enable the tracepoint.

 *
 * proto: the prototype of the function trace_foo_bar()
 *   Here it is trace_foo_bar(char *foo, int bar).
 *
 * args:  must match the arguments in the prototype.
 *    Here it is simply "foo, bar".
 *
 * struct:  This defines the way the data will be stored in the ring buffer.
 *    There are currently two types of elements. __field and __array.
 *    a __field is broken up into (type, name). Where type can be any
 *    type but an array.
 *    For an array. there are three fields. (type, name, size). The
 *    type of elements in the array, the name of the field and the size
 *    of the array.
 *
 *    __array( char, foo, 10) is the same as saying   char foo[10].
 *
 * fast_assign: This is a C like function that is used to store the items
 *    into the ring buffer.
 *
 * printk: This is a way to print out the data in pretty print. This is
 *    useful if the system crashes and you are logging via a serial line,
 *    the data can be printed to the console using this "printk" method.
 *
 * Note, that for both the assign and the printk, __entry is the handler
 * to the data structure in the ring buffer, and is defined by the
 * TP_STRUCT__entry.
