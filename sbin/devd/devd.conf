# Examples of notify hooks.  A notify is a generic way for a kernel
# subsystem to send event notification to userland.

# Here are some examples of ACPI notify handlers.  ACPI subsystems that
# generate notifies include the AC adapter, power/sleep buttons,
# control method batteries, lid switch, and thermal zones.
#
# Information returned is not always the same as the ACPI notify
# events.  See the ACPI specification for more information about
# notifies.  Here is the information returned for each subsystem:
#
# ACAD:            AC line state (0 is offline, 1 is online)
# Button:          Button pressed (0 for power, 1 for sleep)
# CMBAT:           ACPI battery events
# Lid:             Lid state (0 is closed, 1 is open)
# Suspend, Resume: Suspend and resume notification
# Thermal:         ACPI thermal zone events
#
# This example calls a script when the AC state changes, passing the
# notify value as the first argument.  If the state is 0x00, it might
# call some sysctls to implement economy mode.  If 0x01, it might set
# the mode to performance.
