Appendix A \- Fsck_ffs Error Conditions
.NH 2
Conventions
.PP
.I Fsck_ffs
is
a multi-pass file system check program.
Each file system pass invokes a different Phase of the
.I fsck_ffs
program.
After the initial setup,
.I fsck_ffs
performs successive Phases over each file system,
checking blocks and sizes,
path-names,
connectivity,
reference counts,
and the map of free blocks,
(possibly rebuilding it),
and performs some cleanup.
.LP
Normally
.I fsck_ffs
is run non-interactively to
.I preen
the file systems after an unclean halt.
While preen'ing a file system,
it will only fix corruptions that are expected
to occur from an unclean halt.
These actions are a proper subset of the actions that
.I fsck_ffs
will take when it is running interactively.
Throughout this appendix many errors have several options
that the operator can take.
When an inconsistency is detected,
.I fsck_ffs
reports the error condition to the operator.
If a response is required,
.I fsck_ffs
prints a prompt message and
waits for a response.
When preen'ing most errors are fatal.
For those that are expected,
the response taken is noted.
This appendix explains the meaning of each error condition,
the possible responses, and the related error conditions.
.LP
The error conditions are organized by the
.I Phase
of the
.I fsck_ffs
program in which they can occur.
The error conditions that may occur
in more than one Phase
will be discussed in initialization.
.NH 2
Initialization
.PP
Before a file system check can be performed, certain
tables have to be set up and certain files opened.
This section concerns itself with the opening of files and
the initialization of tables.
This section lists error conditions resulting from
command line options,
memory requests,
opening of files,
status of files,
file system size checks,
and creation of the scratch file.
All the initialization errors are fatal
when the file system is being preen'ed.

.br
.B "USE -b OPTION TO FSCK_FFS TO SPECIFY LOCATION OF AN ALTERNATE"
.br
.B "SUPER-BLOCK TO SUPPLY NEEDED INFORMATION; SEE fsck_ffs(8)."
.br
The super block has been corrupted.
An alternative super block must be selected from among those
listed by
.I newfs
(8) when the file system was created.
For file systems with a blocksize less than 32K,
specifying \-b 32 is a good first choice.
.sp
.LP
.B "INTERNAL INCONSISTENCY: \fIM\fP"

.br
.I Fsck_ffs 's
request for moving to a specified block number \fIB\fP in
the file system failed.
This should never happen.
See a guru.
.LP
Possible responses to the CONTINUE prompt are:
.IP YES
attempt to continue to run the file system check.
Often,
however the problem will persist.
This error condition will not allow a complete check of the file system.
A second run of
.I fsck_ffs
should be made to re-check this file system.
If the block was part of the virtual memory buffer
cache,
.I fsck_ffs
will terminate with the message ``Fatal I/O error''.
.IP NO

.sp
.LP
.B "CAN NOT READ: BLK \fIB\fP (CONTINUE)"
.br
.I Fsck_ffs 's
request for reading a specified block number \fIB\fP in
the file system failed.
This should never happen.
See a guru.
.LP
Possible responses to the CONTINUE prompt are:
.IP YES
attempt to continue to run the file system check.
It will retry the read and print out the message:
.br
.B "THE FOLLOWING SECTORS COULD NOT BE READ: \fIN\fP"
.br
where \fIN\fP indicates the sectors that could not be read.
If
.I fsck_ffs
ever tries to write back one of the blocks on which the read failed
it will print the message:
.br
.B "WRITING ZERO'ED BLOCK \fIN\fP TO DISK"
.br
where \fIN\fP indicates the sector that was written with zero's.
If the disk is experiencing hardware problems, the problem will persist.
This error condition will not allow a complete check of the file system.
A second run of
.I fsck_ffs
should be made to re-check this file system.
If the block was part of the virtual memory buffer
cache,
.I fsck_ffs
will terminate with the message ``Fatal I/O error''.
.IP NO
terminate the program.
.sp
.LP
.B "CAN NOT WRITE: BLK \fIB\fP (CONTINUE)"
.br
.I Fsck_ffs 's
request for writing a specified block number \fIB\fP
in the file system failed.
The disk is write-protected;
check the write protect lock on the drive.
If that is not the problem, see a guru.
.LP
Possible responses to the CONTINUE prompt are:
.IP YES
attempt to continue to run the file system check.
The write operation will be retried with the failed blocks
indicated by the message:
.br
.B "THE FOLLOWING SECTORS COULD NOT BE WRITTEN: \fIN\fP"
.br
where \fIN\fP indicates the sectors that could not be written.
If the disk is experiencing hardware problems, the problem will persist.
This error condition will not allow a complete check of the file system.
A second run of
.I fsck_ffs
should be made to re-check this file system.
If the block was part of the virtual memory buffer
cache,
.I fsck_ffs
will terminate with the message ``Fatal I/O error''.
.IP NO
terminate the program.
.sp
.LP
.B "bad inode number DDD to ginode"
.br
An internal error has attempted to read non-existent inode \fIDDD\fP.
This error causes
.I fsck_ffs
to exit.
See a guru.
.NH 2
Phase 1 \- Check Blocks and Sizes
.PP
This phase concerns itself with
the inode list.
This section lists error conditions resulting from
checking inode types,
setting up the zero-link-count table,
examining inode block numbers for bad or duplicate blocks,
checking inode size,
and checking inode format.
All errors in this phase except
.B "INCORRECT BLOCK COUNT"
and
.B "PARTIALLY TRUNCATED INODE"
are fatal if the file system is being preen'ed.
.sp
.LP
.B "UNKNOWN FILE TYPE I=\fII\fP (CLEAR)"
.br
The mode word of the inode \fII\fP indicates that the inode is not a
special block inode, special character inode, socket inode, regular inode,
symbolic link, or directory inode.
.LP
Possible responses to the CLEAR prompt are:
.IP YES
de-allocate inode \fII\fP by zeroing its contents.
This will always invoke the UNALLOCATED error condition in Phase 2
for each directory entry pointing to this inode.
.IP NO
ignore this error condition.
.sp
.LP
.B "PARTIALLY TRUNCATED INODE I=\fII\fP (SALVAGE)"
.br
.I Fsck_ffs
has found inode \fII\fP whose size is shorter than the number of
blocks allocated to it.
This condition should only occur if the system crashes while in the
midst of truncating a file.
When preen'ing the file system,
.I fsck_ffs
completes the truncation to the specified size.
.LP
Possible responses to SALVAGE are:
.IP YES
complete the truncation to the size specified in the inode.
.IP NO
ignore this error condition.
.sp
.LP
.B "LINK COUNT TABLE OVERFLOW (CONTINUE)"
.br
An internal table for
.I fsck_ffs
containing allocated inodes with a link count of
zero cannot allocate more memory.
Increase the virtual memory for
.I fsck_ffs .
.LP
Possible responses to the CONTINUE prompt are:
.IP YES
continue with the program.
This error condition will not allow a complete check of the file system.
A second run of
.I fsck_ffs
should be made to re-check this file system.
If another allocated inode with a zero link count is found,
this error condition is repeated.
.IP NO
terminate the program.
.sp
.LP
.B "\fIB\fP BAD I=\fII\fP"
.br
Inode \fII\fP contains block number \fIB\fP with a number
lower than the number of the first data block in the file system or
greater than the number of the last block
in the file system.
This error condition may invoke the
.B "EXCESSIVE BAD BLKS"
error condition in Phase 1 (see next paragraph) if
inode \fII\fP has too many block numbers outside the file system range.
This error condition will always invoke the
.B "BAD/DUP"
error condition in Phase 2 and Phase 4.
.sp
.LP
.B "EXCESSIVE BAD BLKS I=\fII\fP (CONTINUE)"
.br
There is more than a tolerable number (usually 10) of blocks with a number
lower than the number of the first data block in the file system or greater than
the number of last block in the file system associated with inode \fII\fP.
.LP
Possible responses to the CONTINUE prompt are:
.IP YES
ignore the rest of the blocks in this inode
and continue checking with the next inode in the file system.
This error condition will not allow a complete check of the file system.
A second run of
.I fsck_ffs
should be made to re-check this file system.
.IP NO
terminate the program.
.sp
.LP
.B "BAD STATE DDD TO BLKERR"
.br
An internal error has scrambled
.I fsck_ffs 's
state map to have the impossible value \fIDDD\fP.
.I Fsck_ffs
exits immediately.
See a guru.
.sp
.LP
.B "\fIB\fP DUP I=\fII\fP"
.br
Inode \fII\fP contains block number \fIB\fP that is already claimed by
another inode.
This error condition may invoke the
.B "EXCESSIVE DUP BLKS"
error condition in Phase 1 if
inode \fII\fP has too many block numbers claimed by other inodes.
This error condition will always invoke Phase 1b and the
.B "BAD/DUP"
error condition in Phase 2 and Phase 4.
.sp
.LP
.B "EXCESSIVE DUP BLKS I=\fII\fP (CONTINUE)"
.br
There is more than a tolerable number (usually 10) of blocks claimed by other
inodes.
.LP
Possible responses to the CONTINUE prompt are:
.IP YES
ignore the rest of the blocks in this inode
and continue checking with the next inode in the file system.
This error condition will not allow a complete check of the file system.
A second run of
.I fsck_ffs
should be made to re-check this file system.
.IP NO
terminate the program.
.sp
.LP
.B "DUP TABLE OVERFLOW (CONTINUE)"
.br
An internal table in
.I fsck_ffs
containing duplicate block numbers cannot allocate any more space.
Increase the amount of virtual memory available to
.I fsck_ffs .
.LP
Possible responses to the CONTINUE prompt are:
.IP YES
continue with the program.
This error condition will not allow a complete check of the file system.
A second run of
.I fsck_ffs
should be made to re-check this file system.
If another duplicate block is found, this error condition will repeat.
.IP NO
terminate the program.
.sp
.LP
.B "PARTIALLY ALLOCATED INODE I=\fII\fP (CLEAR)"
.br
Inode \fII\fP is neither allocated nor unallocated.
.LP
Possible responses to the CLEAR prompt are:
.IP YES
de-allocate inode \fII\fP by zeroing its contents.
.IP NO
ignore this error condition.
.sp
.LP
.B "INCORRECT BLOCK COUNT I=\fII\fP (\fIX\fP should be \fIY\fP) (CORRECT)"
.br
The block count for inode \fII\fP is \fIX\fP blocks,
but should be \fIY\fP blocks.
When preen'ing the count is corrected.
.LP
Possible responses to the CORRECT prompt are:
.IP YES
replace the block count of inode \fII\fP with \fIY\fP.
.IP NO
ignore this error condition.
.NH 2
Phase 1B: Rescan for More Dups
.PP
When a duplicate block is found in the file system, the file system is
rescanned to find the inode that previously claimed that block.
This section lists the error condition when the duplicate block is found.
.sp
.LP
.B "\fIB\fP DUP I=\fII\fP"
.br
Inode \fII\fP contains block number \fIB\fP that
is already claimed by another inode.
This error condition will always invoke the
.B "BAD/DUP"
error condition in Phase 2.
You can determine which inodes have overlapping blocks by examining
this error condition and the DUP error condition in Phase 1.
.NH 2
Phase 2 \- Check Pathnames
.PP
This phase concerns itself with removing directory entries
pointing to
error conditioned inodes
from Phase 1 and Phase 1b.
This section lists error conditions resulting from
root inode mode and status,
directory inode pointers in range,
and directory entries pointing to bad inodes,
and directory integrity checks.
All errors in this phase are fatal if the file system is being preen'ed,
except for directories not being a multiple of the blocks size
and extraneous hard links.
.sp
.LP
.B "ROOT INODE UNALLOCATED (ALLOCATE)"
.br
The root inode (usually inode number 2) has no allocate mode bits.
This should never happen.
.LP
Possible responses to the ALLOCATE prompt are:
.IP YES
allocate inode 2 as the root inode.
The files and directories usually found in the root will be recovered
in Phase 3 and put into
.I lost+found .
If the attempt to allocate the root fails,
.I fsck_ffs
will exit with the message:
.br
.B "CANNOT ALLOCATE ROOT INODE" .
.IP NO
.I fsck_ffs
will exit.
.sp
.LP
.B "ROOT INODE NOT DIRECTORY (REALLOCATE)"
.br
The root inode (usually inode number 2)
is not directory inode type.
.LP
Possible responses to the REALLOCATE prompt are:
.IP YES
clear the existing contents of the root inode
and reallocate it.
The files and directories usually found in the root will be recovered
in Phase 3 and put into
.I lost+found .
If the attempt to allocate the root fails,
.I fsck_ffs
will exit with the message:
.br
.B "CANNOT ALLOCATE ROOT INODE" .
.IP NO
.I fsck_ffs
will then prompt with
.B "FIX"
.LP
Possible responses to the FIX prompt are:
.IP YES
replace the root inode's type to be a directory.
If the root inode's data blocks are not directory blocks,
many error conditions will be produced.
.IP NO
terminate the program.
.sp
.LP
.B "DUPS/BAD IN ROOT INODE (REALLOCATE)"
.br
Phase 1 or Phase 1b have found duplicate blocks
or bad blocks in the root inode (usually inode number 2) for the file system.
.LP
Possible responses to the REALLOCATE prompt are:
.IP YES
clear the existing contents of the root inode
and reallocate it.
The files and directories usually found in the root will be recovered
in Phase 3 and put into
.I lost+found .
If the attempt to allocate the root fails,
.I fsck_ffs
will exit with the message:
.br
.B "CANNOT ALLOCATE ROOT INODE" .
.IP NO
.I fsck_ffs
will then prompt with
.B "CONTINUE" .
.LP
Possible responses to the CONTINUE prompt are:
.IP YES
ignore the
.B "DUPS/BAD"
error condition in the root inode and
attempt to continue to run the file system check.
If the root inode is not correct,
then this may result in many other error conditions.
.IP NO
terminate the program.
.sp
.LP
.B "NAME TOO LONG \fIF\fP"
.br
An excessively long path name has been found.
This usually indicates loops in the file system name space.
This can occur if the super user has made circular links to directories.
The offending links must be removed (by a guru).
.sp
.LP
.B "I OUT OF RANGE I=\fII\fP NAME=\fIF\fP (REMOVE)"
.br
A directory entry \fIF\fP has an inode number \fII\fP that is greater than
the end of the inode list.
.LP
Possible responses to the REMOVE prompt are:
.IP YES
the directory entry \fIF\fP is removed.
.IP NO
ignore this error condition.
.sp
.LP
.B "UNALLOCATED I=\fII\fP OWNER=\fIO\fP MODE=\fIM\fP SIZE=\fIS\fP MTIME=\fIT\fP \fItype\fP=\fIF\fP (REMOVE)"

.LP
Possible responses to the REMOVE prompt are:
.IP YES
the directory entry \fIF\fP is removed.
.IP NO
ignore this error condition.
.sp
.LP
.B "DUP/BAD I=\fII\fP OWNER=\fIO\fP MODE=\fIM\fP SIZE=\fIS\fP MTIME=\fIT\fP \fItype\fP=\fIF\fP (REMOVE)"
.br
Phase 1 or Phase 1b have found duplicate blocks or bad blocks
associated with directory or file entry \fIF\fP, inode \fII\fP.
The owner \fIO\fP, mode \fIM\fP, size \fIS\fP, modify time \fIT\fP,
