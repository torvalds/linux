.Nm iked
.Nd Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm iked
.Op Fl dnSTtVv
.Op Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl p Ar udpencap_port
.Op Fl s Ar socket
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) daemon which performs mutual
authentication and which establishes and maintains IPsec flows and
security associations (SAs) between the two peers.
.Pp
The IKEv2 protocol is defined in RFC 7296,
which combines and updates the previous standards:
ISAKMP/Oakley (RFC 2408),
IKE (RFC 2409),
and the Internet DOI (RFC 2407).
.Nm
only supports the IKEv2 protocol;
support for
ISAKMP/Oakley and IKEv1
is provided by
.Xr isakmpd 8 .
.Pp
.Nm
supports mutual authentication using RSA or ECDSA public keys and X.509
certificates.
See the
.Sx PUBLIC KEY AUTHENTICATION
section below and PKI AND CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY COMMANDS in
.Xr ikectl 8
for more information about creating and maintaining the public key
infrastructure.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Use
.Ar file
as the configuration file, instead of the default
.Pa /etc/iked.conf .
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl p Ar udpencap_port
Specify the listen port for encapsulated UDP that
the daemon will bind to as well as the UDP encapsulation port set
in resulting IPsec SAs.
In order to receive UDP encapsulated IPsec packets on ports other
than 4500, the
.Em net.inet.esp.udpencap_port
.Xr sysctl 2
variable has to be set accordingly.
Implies -t.
.It Fl S
Start
.Nm
in passive mode.
See the
.Ic set passive
option in
.Xr iked.conf 5
for more information.
.It Fl s Ar socket
Use
.Ar socket
as the control socket, instead of the default
.Pa /var/run/iked.sock .
.It Fl T
Disable NAT-Traversal and do not propose NAT-Traversal support to the peers.
.It Fl t
Enforce NAT-Traversal and only listen to NAT-Traversal messages.
This option is only recommended for testing; the default is to
negotiate NAT-Traversal with the peers.
.It Fl V
Show the version and exit.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
.El
.Sh PUBLIC KEY AUTHENTICATION
It is possible to store trusted public keys to make them directly
usable by
.Nm ,
bypassing the need to use certificates.
The keys should be saved in PEM format (see
.Xr openssl 1 )
and named and stored as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "for_ufqdn_identitiesXX" -offset 3n -compact
.It For IPv4 identities:
/etc/iked/pubkeys/ipv4/A.B.C.D
.It For IPv6 identities:
/etc/iked/pubkeys/ipv6/abcd:abcd::ab:bc
.It For FQDN identities:
/etc/iked/pubkeys/fqdn/foo.bar.org
.It For UFQDN identities:
/etc/iked/pubkeys/ufqdn/user@foo.bar.org
.El
.Pp
Depending on the
.Ic srcid
and
.Ic dstid
specifications in
.Xr iked.conf 5 ,
keys may be named after their IPv4 address, IPv6 address,
fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or user fully qualified domain name (UFQDN).
.Pp
For example,
.Nm
can authenticate using the pre-generated keys if the local public key,
by default
.Pa /etc/iked/local.pub ,
is copied to the remote gateway as
.Pa /etc/iked/pubkeys/ipv4/local.gateway.ip.address
and the remote gateway's public key
is copied to the local gateway as
.Pa /etc/iked/pubkeys/ipv4/remote.gateway.ip.address .
Of course, new keys may also be generated
(the user is not required to use the pre-generated keys).
In this example,
.Ic srcid
and
.Ic dstid
would also have to be set to the specified addresses
in
.Xr iked.conf 5 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/iked/private/XXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/iked.conf
The default
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Pa /etc/iked/ca/
The directory where CA certificates are kept.
.It Pa /etc/iked/certs/
The directory where IKE certificates are kept, both the local
certificate(s) and those of the peers, if a choice to have them kept
permanently has been made.
.It Pa /etc/iked/crls/
The directory where CRLs are kept.
.It Pa /etc/iked/private/
The directory where local private keys used for public key authentication
are kept.
The file
.Pa local.key
is used to store the local private key.
.It Pa /etc/iked/pubkeys/
The directory in which trusted public keys are kept.
The keys must be named in the fashion described above.
.It Pa /var/run/iked.sock
The default
.Nm
control socket.
