.Sh NAME
.Nm isakmpd.policy
.Nd policy configuration file for isakmpd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the policy configuration file for the
.Xr isakmpd 8
daemon, managing security association and key management for the
.Xr ipsec 4
layer of the kernel's networking stack.
The
.Xr isakmpd 8
daemon,
also known as the IKEv1 key management daemon,
implements the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) protocol.
It follows then that references to IKE in this document
pertain to IKEv1 only,
and not IKEv2.
.Pp
.Xr isakmpd 8
is used when two
systems need to automatically set up a pair of Security Associations
(SAs) for secure communication using IPsec.
IKEv1 operates in two stages:
.Pp
In the first stage (Main or Identity Protection Mode), the two IKE
daemons establish a secure link between themselves, fully
authenticating each other and establishing key material for
encrypting/authenticating future communications between them.
This step is typically only performed once for every pair of IKE daemons.
.Pp
In the second stage (also called Quick Mode), the two IKE daemons
create the pair of SAs for the parties that wish to communicate using
IPsec.
These parties may be the hosts the IKE daemons run on, a host
and a network behind a firewall, or two networks behind their
respective firewalls.
At this stage, the exact parameters of the SAs
(e.g., algorithms to use, encapsulation mode, lifetime) and the
identities of the communicating parties (hosts, networks, etc.) are
specified.
The reason for the existence of Quick Mode is to allow for fast
SA setup, once the more heavy-weight Main Mode has been completed.
Generally, Quick Mode uses the key material derived from Main Mode to
provide keys to the IPsec transforms to be used.
.Pp
Alternatively, a new
Diffie-Hellman computation may be performed, which significantly slows
down the exchange, but at the same time provides Perfect Forward
Secrecy (PFS).
Briefly, this means that even should an attacker
manage to break long-term keys used in other sessions (or,
specifically, if an attacker breaks the Diffie-Hellman exchange
performed during Main Mode), they will not be able to decrypt this
traffic.
Normally, no PFS is provided (the key material used by the
IPsec SAs established as a result of this exchange will be derived
from the key material of the Main Mode exchange), allowing for a
faster Quick Mode exchange (no public key computations).
.Pp
IKE proposals are "suggestions" by the initiator of an exchange to the
responder as to what protocols and attributes should be used on a
class of packets.
For example, a given exchange may ask for ESP with
3DES and MD5 and AH with SHA1 (applied successively on the same
packet), or just ESP with Blowfish and RIPEMD-160.
The responder
examines the proposals and determines which of them are acceptable,
according to policy and any credentials.
.Pp
The following paragraphs assume some knowledge of the contents of the
.Xr keynote 4
and
.Xr keynote 5
man pages.
.Pp
In the KeyNote policy model for IPsec, no distinction is currently
made based on the ordering of AH and ESP in the packet.
Should this
change in the future, an appropriate attribute (see below) will be
added.
.Pp
The goal of security policy for IKE is thus to determine, based on
local policy (provided in the
.Nm
file), credentials provided during the IKE exchanges (or obtained
through other means), the SA attributes proposed during the exchange,
and perhaps other (side-channel) information, whether a pair of SAs
should be installed in the system (in fact, whether both the IPsec SAs
and the flows should be installed).
For each proposal suggested by or
to the remote IKE daemon, the KeyNote system is consulted as to
whether the proposal is acceptable based on local policy (contained in
.Nm ,
in the form of policy assertions) and remote credentials (e.g.,
KeyNote credentials or X.509 certificates provided by the remote IKE
daemon).
.Pp
.Nm
is simply a flat
.Xr ascii 7
file containing KeyNote policy assertions, separated by blank lines
(note that KeyNote assertions may not contain blank lines).
.Nm
is read when
.Xr isakmpd 8
is first started, and every time it receives a
.Dv SIGHUP
signal.
The new policies read will be used for all new Phase 2 (IPsec)
SAs established from that point on (even if the associated Phase 1 SA
was already established when the new policies were loaded).
The policy change will not affect already established Phase 2 SAs.
.Pp
For more details on KeyNote assertion format, see
.Xr keynote 5 .
Briefly, KeyNote policy assertions used in IKE have the following
characteristics:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The Authorizer field is typically "POLICY" (but see the examples
below, for use of policy delegation).
.It
The Licensees field can be an expression of passphrases used for
authentication of the Main Mode exchanges, and/or public keys
(typically, X.509 certificates), and/or X.509 distinguished names.
.It
The Conditions field contains an expression of attributes from the
IPsec policy action set (see below as well as the keynote syntax man
page for more details).
.It
The ordered return-values set for IPsec policy is "false, true".
.El
.Pp
For an explanation of these fields and their semantics, see
.Xr keynote 5 .
.Pp
For example, the following policy assertion:
.Bd -literal
    Authorizer: "POLICY"
    Licensees: "passphrase:foobar" || "x509-base64:abcd==" ||
      "passphrase-md5-hex:3858f62230ac3c915f300c664312c63f" ||
      "passphrase-sha1-hex:8843d7f92416211de9ebb963ff4ce28125932878"
    Conditions: app_domain == "IPsec policy" && esp_present == "yes"
		&& esp_enc_alg != "null" -> "true";
.Ed
.Pp
says that any proposal from a remote host that authenticates using the
passphrase "foobar" or the public key contained in the X.509
certificate encoded as "abcd==" will be accepted, as long as it
contains ESP with a non-null algorithm (i.e., the packet will be
encrypted).
The last two authorizers are the MD5 and SHA1 hashes respectively of
the passphrase "foobar".
This form may be used instead of the "passphrase:..." one to protect
the passphrase as included in the policy file (or as distributed in a
signed credential).
.Pp
The following policy assertion:
.Bd -literal
    Authorizer: "POLICY"
    Licensees: "DN:/CN=CA Certificate"
    Conditions: app_domain == "IPsec policy" && esp_present == "yes"
		&& esp_enc_alg != "null" -> "true";
.Ed
.Pp
is similar to the previous one, but instead of including a complete
X.509 credential in the Licensees field, only the X.509 certificate's
Subject Canonical Name needs to be specified (note that the "DN:"
prefix is necessary).
.Pp
KeyNote credentials have the same format as policy assertions, with
one difference: the Authorizer field always contains a public key, and
the assertion is signed (and thus its integrity can be
cryptographically verified).
Credentials are used to build chains of delegation of authority.
They can be exchanged during an IKE exchange,
or can be retrieved through some out-of-band mechanism (no such
mechanism is currently supported in this implementation however).
See
.Xr isakmpd.conf 5
on how to specify what credentials to send in an IKE exchange.
.Pp
Passphrases that appear in the Licensees field are encoded as the
string "passphrase:", followed by the passphrase itself
(case-sensitive).
Alternatively (and preferably), they may be encoded using the
"passphrase-md5-hex:" or "passphrase-sha1-hex:" prefixes, followed
by the
.Xr md5 1
or
.Xr sha1 1
hash of the passphrase itself, encoded as a hexadecimal string (using
lower-case letters only).
.Pp
When X.509-based authentication is performed in Main Mode, any X.509
certificates received from the remote IKE daemon are converted to very
simple KeyNote credentials.
The conversion is straightforward: the
issuer of the X.509 certificate becomes the Authorizer of the KeyNote
credential, the subject becomes the only Licensees entry, while the
Conditions field simply asserts that the credential is only valid for
"IPsec policy" use (see the app_domain action attribute below).
.Pp
Similarly, any X.509 CA certificates present in the directory pointed
to by the appropriate
.Xr isakmpd.conf 5
entry are converted to such pseudo-credentials.
This allows one to
write KeyNote policies that delegate specific authority to CAs (and
the keys those CAs certify, recursively).
.Pp
For more details on KeyNote assertion format, see
.Xr keynote 5 .
.Pp
Information about the proposals, the identity of the remote IKE
daemon, the packet classes to be protected, etc. are encoded in what
is called an action set.
The action set is composed of name-value
attributes, similar in some ways to shell environment variables.
These values are initialized by
.Xr isakmpd 8
before each query to the KeyNote system, and can be tested against in
the Conditions field of assertions.
See
.Xr keynote 4
and
.Xr keynote 5
for more details on the format and semantics of the Conditions field.
.Pp
Note that assertions and credentials can make references to
non-existent attributes without catastrophic failures (access may be
denied, depending on the overall structure, but will not be
accidentally granted).
One reason for credentials referencing
non-existent attributes is that they were defined within a specific
implementation or network only.
.Pp
In the following attribute set, IPv4 addresses are encoded as ASCII
strings in the usual dotted-quad format.
However, all quads are three digits long.
For example, the IPv4 address 10.128.1.12 would be encoded as 010.128.001.012.
Similarly, IPv6 addresses are encoded in the standard x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x
format, where the 'x's are the hexadecimal values of the eight 16-bit
pieces of the address.
All 'x's are four digits long.
For example, the address 1080:0:12:0:8:800:200C:417A
would be encoded as 1080:0000:0012:0000:0008:0800:200C:417A.
