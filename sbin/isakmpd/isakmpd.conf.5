.Sh NAME
.Nm isakmpd.conf
.Nd configuration file for isakmpd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the
.Xr isakmpd 8
daemon, managing security association and key management for the
IPsec layer of the kernel's networking stack.
.Pp
The file is of a well-known type of format called .INI style, named after
the suffix used by an overrated windowing environment for its configuration
files.
This format consists of sections, each beginning with a line looking like:
.Bd -unfilled
.Bq Sy Section name
.Ed
Between the brackets is the name of the section following this section header.
Inside a section many tag/value pairs can be stored, each one looking like:
.Bd -unfilled
.Ar Tag Ns = Ns Ar Value
.Ed
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
the comment remains in effect until the end of the entire current line.
.Pp
Often the right-hand side values consist of other section names.
This results in a tree structure.
Some values are treated as a list of several scalar values.
Such lists always use a comma character as the separator.
Some values are formatted like this: X,Y:Z, which
is an offer/accept syntax, where X is a value we offer and Y:Z is a range of
accepted values, inclusive.
.Pp
To activate changes to
.Nm
without restarting
.Xr isakmpd 8 ,
send a
.Dv SIGHUP
signal to the daemon process.
.Sh AUTO-GENERATED PARTS OF THE CONFIGURATION
Some predefined section names are recognized by the daemon, avoiding the need
to fully specify the Main Mode transforms and Quick Mode suites, protocols,
and transforms.
.Pp
For Main Mode:
.\" cipher-hash[-group][-RSA_SIG]
.Bl -inset -compact
.It Xo
.Sm off
.Ar cipher No - Ar hash
.Op - Ar group
.Op -RSA_SIG
.Sm on
.Xc
.El
.Pp
where:
.Bl -tag -width "cipher" -offset indent -compact
.It Ar cipher
is either BLF, 3DES, CAST, AES, AES-128, AES-192 or AES-256
.It Ar hash
is either MD5, SHA, or SHA2-{256,384,512}
.It Ar group
is either GRP1, GRP2, GRP5, GRP14, GRP15, GRP16, GRP17, GRP18,
GRP19, GRP20, GRP21, GRP26, GRP27, GRP28, GRP29 or GRP30.
.El
.Pp
For Quick Mode:
.\" QM-proto[-TRP]-cipher[-hash][-PFS[-group]]-SUITE
.Bl -inset -compact
.It Xo
.Sm off
.No QM- Ar proto Op -TRP
.No - Ar cipher Op - Ar hash
.Op -PFS Op - Ar group
.No -SUITE
.Sm on
.Xc
.El
.Pp
where:
.Bl -tag -width "cipher" -offset indent -compact
.It Ar proto
is either ESP or AH
.It Ar cipher
is either 3DES, CAST, BLF, AES, AES-128, AES-192, AES-256, AESCTR,
AESCTR-128, AESCTR-192, AESCTR-256,
AESGCM-128, AESGCM-192, AESGCM-256, AESGMAC-128, AESGMAC-192, AESGMAC-256
or NULL
.It Ar hash
is either MD5, SHA, RIPEMD, or SHA2-{256,384,512}
.It Ar group
is either GRP1, GRP2, GRP5, GRP14, GRP15, GRP16, GRP17, GRP18,
GRP19, GRP20, GRP21, GRP26, GRP27, GRP28, GRP29 or GRP30.
.El
.Pp
For example, AES-SHA2-256 means: AES encryption, SHA2-256 hash, and
authorization by pre-shared keys.
Adding "-RSA_SIG" will enable public key authentication,
e.g. AES-SHA2-256-RSA_SIG.
Similarly, QM-ESP-3DES-SHA-PFS-SUITE means: ESP protocol, 3DES encryption,
SHA hash, and use Perfect Forward Secrecy.
.Pp
Unless explicitly stated with -GRP1, 2, 5, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
26, 27, 28, 29 or 30, transforms and PFS suites use DH group 2.
There are currently no predefined ESP+AH Quick Mode suites.
.Pp
The predefinitions include some default values for the special
sections "General", "Keynote", "X509-certificates", and
"Default-phase-1-configuration".
These default values are presented in the example below.
.Pp
All autogenerated values can be overridden by manual entries by using the
same section and tag names in the configuration file.
In particular, the default phase 1 (Main or Aggressive Mode) and phase 2
(Quick Mode) lifetimes can be overridden by these tags under the "General"
section:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[General]
Default-phase-1-lifetime=	3600,60:86400
Default-phase-2-lifetime=	1200,60:86400
.Ed
.Pp
The Main Mode lifetime currently defaults to one hour (minimum 60
seconds, maximum 1 day).
The Quick Mode lifetime defaults to 20 minutes
(minimum 60 seconds, maximum 1 day).
.Pp
Also, the default phase 1 ID can be set by creating a
.Aq Sy Phase1-ID
section, as shown below, and adding this tag under the "General"
section:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[General]
Default-phase-1-ID=		Phase1-ID-name

[Phase1-ID-name]
ID-type=			USER_FQDN
Name=				foo@bar.com
.Ed
.Sh ROOTS
.Bl -hang -width 8n
.It Bq Sy General
Generic global configuration parameters
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em Acquire-Only
If this tag is defined,
.Xr isakmpd 8
will not set up flows automatically.
This is useful when flows are configured with
.Xr ipsecctl 8
or by other programs like
.Xr bgpd 8 .
Thus
.Xr isakmpd 8
only takes care of the SA establishment.
.It Em Check-interval
The interval between watchdog checks of connections we want up at all
times, in seconds.
The default value is 60 seconds.
.It Em Default-phase-1-ID
Optional default phase 1 ID name.
.It Em Default-phase-1-lifetime
The default lifetime for autogenerated transforms (phase 1).
If unspecified, the value 3600,60:86400 is used as the default.
.It Em Default-phase-2-lifetime
The default lifetime for autogenerated suites (phase 2).
If unspecified, the value 1200,60:86400 is used as the default.
.It Em Default-phase-2-suites
A list of phase 2 suites that will be used when establishing dynamic
SAs.
If left unspecified, QM-ESP-3DES-SHA-PFS-SUITE is used as the default.
.It Em DPD-check-interval
The interval between RFC 3706 (Dead Peer Detection) messages, in seconds.
The default value is 0 (zero), which means DPD is disabled.
.It Em Exchange-max-time
How many seconds should an exchange maximally take to set up before we
give up.
.It Em Listen-on
A list of IP addresses or interface names OK to listen on.
This list is used as a filter for the set of addresses the interfaces
configured provides.
This means that we won't see if an address given here does not exist
on this host, and thus no error is given for that case.
On multi-homed systems, this parameter can be used to enforce the
use of particular source IP addresses in packets sent by
.Xr isakmpd 8 .
.It Em Loglevel
A list of the form
.Ar class Ns = Ns Ar level ,
where both
.Ar class
and
.Ar level
are numbers.
This is similar to the
.Fl D
command line switch of
.Xr isakmpd 8 .
.It Em Logverbose
If this tag is defined, whatever the value is, verbose logging is enabled.
This is similar to the
.Fl v
command line switch of
.Xr isakmpd 8 .
.It Em NAT-T-Keepalive
The number of seconds between NAT-T keepalive messages, sent by the
peer behind NAT to keep the mapping active.
Defaults to 20.
.It Em Policy-file
The name of the file that contains
.Xr keynote 4
policies.
The default is
.Pa /etc/isakmpd/isakmpd.policy .
.It Em Pubkey-directory
The directory in which
.Nm
looks for explicitly trusted public keys.
The default is
.Pa /etc/isakmpd/pubkeys .
Read
.Xr isakmpd 8
for the required naming convention of the files in here.
.It Em Renegotiate-on-HUP
If this tag is defined, whatever the value is,
.Xr isakmpd 8
will renegotiate all current phase 2 SAs when the daemon receives a
.Dv SIGHUP
signal, or an
.Sq R
is sent to the FIFO interface (see
.Xr isakmpd 8 ) .
.It Em Retransmits
How many times should a message be retransmitted before giving up.
.It Em Shared-SADB
If this tag is defined, whatever the value is, some semantics of
.Nm
are changed so that multiple instances can run on top of one SADB
and set up SAs with each other.
Specifically this means replay
protection will not be asked for, and errors that can occur when
updating an SA with its parameters a 2nd time will be ignored.
.It Em Use-Keynote
This tag controls the use of
.Xr keynote 4
policy checking.
The default value is
.Qq yes ,
which enables the policy checking.
When set to any other value, policies will not be checked.
This is useful when policies for flows and SA establishment are arranged by
other programs like
.Xr ipsecctl 8
or
.Xr bgpd 8 .
.El
.It Bq Sy Phase 1
ISAKMP SA negotiation parameter root
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em Default
A name of the default ISAKMP peer.
Incoming phase 1 connections from other IP addresses will use this peer name.
This name is used as the section name for further information to be found.
Look at
.Aq Sy ISAKMP-peer
below.
.It Aq Em IP-address
A name of the ISAKMP peer at the given IP address.
.El
.It Bq Sy Phase 2
IPsec SA negotiation parameter root
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em Connections
A list of directed IPsec "connection" names that should be brought up
automatically, either on first use if the system supports it, or at
startup of the daemon.
These names are section names where further information can be found.
Look at
.Aq Sy IPsec-connection
below.
Normally any connections mentioned here are treated as part of the
"Passive-connection" list we present below; however there is a flag,
.Em Active-only ,
that disables this behaviour.
This too is mentioned in the
.Aq Sy IPsec-connection
section, in the "Flags" tag.
.It Em Passive-connections
A list of IPsec "connection" names we recognize and accept initiations for.
These names are section names where further information can be found.
Look at
.Aq Sy IPsec-connection
below.
Currently only the Local-ID and Remote-ID tags
are looked at in those sections, as they are matched against the IDs given
by the initiator.
.El
.It Bq Sy KeyNote
KeyNote configuration section
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em Credential-directory
A directory containing directories named after IDs (IP
addresses,
.Dq user@domain ,
or hostnames) that contain files named
.Dq credentials
and
.Dq private_key .
.Pp
The credentials file contains
.Xr keynote 4
credentials that are sent to a remote IKE daemon when we use the
associated ID, or credentials that we may want to consider when doing
an exchange with a remote IKE daemon that uses that ID.
Note that, in the former case, the last credential in the file
MUST contain our public key in its Licensees field.
More than one credentials may exist in the file.
They are separated by whitelines (the format is essentially the same as
that of the policy file).
The credentials are of the same format as the policies described in
.Xr isakmpd.policy 5 .
The only difference is that the Authorizer field contains a public
key, and the assertion is signed.
Signed assertions can be generated using the
.Xr keynote 1
utility.
.Pp
The private_key file contains the private RSA key we use for
authentication.
If the directory (and the files) exist, they take precedence over X509-based
authentication.
.El
.It Bq Sy X509-Certificates
X509-certificate configuration section
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em Accept-self-signed
If this tag is defined, whatever the value is, certificates that
do not originate from a trusted CA but are self-signed will be
accepted.
.It Em Ca-directory
A directory containing PEM certificates of certification authorities
that we trust to sign other certificates.
Note that for a CA to be really trusted, it needs to be somehow
referred to by policy, in
.Xr isakmpd.policy 5 .
The certificates in this directory are used for the actual X.509
authentication and for cross-referencing policies that refer to
Distinguished Names (DNs).
Keeping a separate directory (as opposed to integrating policies
and X.509 CA certificates) allows for maintenance of a list of
"well-known" CAs without actually having to trust all (or any) of them.
.It Em Cert-directory
A directory containing PEM certificates that we trust to be valid.
These certificates are used in preference to those passed in messages and
are required to have a subjectAltName extension containing the certificate
holder identity; usually IP address, FQDN, or User FQDN.
.It Em Private-key
The private key matching the public key of our certificate (which should be
in the "Cert-directory", and have an appropriate subjectAltName field).
.It Em Private-key-directory
A directory containing private keys named after an ID (IP addresses,
.Dq user@domain ,
or hostnames).
.El
.El
.Sh REFERRED-TO SECTIONS
.Bl -hang -width Ds
.It Aq Sy ISAKMP-peer
Parameters for negotiation with an ISAKMP peer
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em Address
If existent, the IP address of the peer.
.It Em Authentication
If existent, authentication data for this specific peer.
In the case of a pre-shared key, this is the key value itself.
.It Em Configuration
The name of the ISAKMP-configuration section to use.
Look at
.Aq Sy ISAKMP-configuration
below.
If unspecified, defaults to "Default-phase-1-configuration".
.It Em Flags
A comma-separated list of flags controlling the further
handling of the ISAKMP SA.
Currently there are no specific ISAKMP SA flags defined.
.It Em ID
If existent, the name of the section that describes the
local client ID that we should present to our peer.
If not present, it
defaults to the address of the local interface we are sending packets
over to the remote daemon.
Look at
.Aq Sy Phase1-ID
below.
.It Em Local-address
The Local IP address to use, if we are multi-homed, or have aliases.
.It Em Phase
The constant
.Sq 1 ,
as ISAKMP-peers and IPsec-connections
really are handled by the same code inside
.Xr isakmpd 8 .
.It Em Port
For UDP, the UDP port number to send to.
This is optional;
the default value is 500 which is the IANA-registered number for ISAKMP.
.It Em Remote-ID
If existent, the name of the section that describes the remote client
ID we expect the remote daemon to send us.
If not present, it defaults to the address of the remote daemon.
Look at
.Aq Sy Phase1-ID
below.
.It Em Transport
The name of the transport protocol; defaults to UDP.
.El
.It Aq Sy Phase1-ID
Parameters for Phase 1 negotiation
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em Address
If the ID-type is
.Li IPV4_ADDR
or
.Li IPV6_ADDR ,
this tag should exist and be an IP address.
.It Em ID-type
The ID type as given by the RFC specifications.
For phase 1 this is currently
.Li IPV4_ADDR ,
.Li IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET ,
.Li IPV6_ADDR ,
.Li IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET ,
.Li FQDN ,
.Li USER_FQDN ,
or
.Li KEY_ID .
.It Em Name
If the ID-type is
.Li FQDN ,
.Li USER_FQDN ,
or
.Li KEY_ID ,
this tag should exist and contain a domain name, user@domain, or
other identifying string respectively.
.Pp
In the case of
.Li KEY_ID ,
note that the IKE protocol allows any octet sequence to be sent or
received under this payload, potentially including non-printable
ones.
.Xr isakmpd 8
can only transmit printable
.Li KEY_ID
payloads, but can receive and process arbitrary
.Li KEY_ID
payloads.
This effectively means that non-printable
.Li KEY_ID
remote identities cannot be verified through this means, although it
is still possible to do so through
.Xr isakmpd.policy 5 .
.It Em Netmask
If the ID-type is
.Li IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET
or
.Li IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET ,
this tag should exist and
be a network subnet mask.
.It Em Network
If the ID-type is
.Li IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET
or
.Li IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET ,
this tag should exist and
be a network address.
.El
.It Aq Sy ISAKMP-configuration

.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em DOI
The domain of interpretation as given by the RFCs.
Normally
.Li IPSEC .
If unspecified, defaults to
.Li IPSEC .
.It Em EXCHANGE_TYPE
The exchange type as given by the RFCs.
For main mode this is
.Li ID_PROT
and for aggressive mode it is
.Li AGGRESSIVE .
.It Em Transforms
A list of proposed transforms to use for protecting the
ISAKMP traffic.
These are actually names for sections
further describing the transforms.
Look at
.Aq Sy ISAKMP-transform
below.
.El
.It Aq Sy ISAKMP-transform
Parameters for ISAKMP authentication
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em AUTHENTICATION_METHOD
The authentication method as the RFCs name it, or ANY.
.It Em ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM
The encryption algorithm as the RFCs name it, or ANY to denote that any
encryption algorithm proposed will be accepted.
.It Em GROUP_DESCRIPTION
The group used for Diffie-Hellman exponentiations, or ANY.
The names are symbolic, like
.Li MODP_768 , MODP_1024 , EC_155 ,
and
.Li EC_185 .
.It Em HASH_ALGORITHM
The hash algorithm as the RFCs name it, or ANY.
.It Em KEY_LENGTH
For encryption algorithms with variable key length, this is
where the offered/accepted keylengths are described.
The value is of the offer-accept kind described above.
.It Em Life
A list of lifetime descriptions, or ANY.
In the former case, each
element is in itself a name of the section that defines the lifetime.
Look at
.Aq Sy Lifetime
below.
If it is set to ANY, then any type of
proposed lifetime type and value will be accepted.
.It Em PRF
The algorithm to use for the keyed pseudo-random function (used for key
derivation and authentication in phase 1), or ANY.
.El
.It Aq Sy Lifetime
Parameters for connection duration
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em LIFE_DURATION
An offer/accept kind of value; see above.
Can also be set to ANY.
.It Em LIFE_TYPE
.Li SECONDS
or
.Li KILOBYTES
depending on the type of the duration.
Notice that this field may NOT be set to ANY.
.El
.It Aq Sy IPsec-connection
Parameters for IPsec connection configuration
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em Configuration
The name of the IPsec-configuration section to use.
Look at
.Aq Sy IPsec-configuration
below.
.It Em Flags
A comma-separated list of flags controlling the further
handling of the IPsec SA.
Currently only one flag is defined:
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It Em Active-only
If this flag is given and this
.Aq Sy IPsec-connection
is part of the phase 2
connections we automatically keep up, it will not automatically be used for
accepting connections from the peer.
.El
.It Em ISAKMP-peer
The name of the ISAKMP-peer to talk to in order to
set up this connection.
The value is the name of an
.Aq Sy ISAKMP-peer
section.
See above.
.It Em Local-ID
If existent, the name of the section that describes the
optional local client ID that we should present to our peer.
It is also used when we act as responders to find out what
.Aq Sy IPsec-connection
we are dealing with.
Look at
.Aq Sy IPsec-ID
below.
.It Em Phase
The constant
.Sq 2 ,
as ISAKMP-peers and IPsec-connections
really are handled by the same code inside
.Xr isakmpd 8 .
.It Em Remote-ID
If existent, the name of the section that describes the
optional remote client ID that we should present to our peer.
It is also used when we act as responders to find out what
.Aq Sy IPsec-connection
we are dealing with.
Look at
.Aq Sy IPsec-ID
below.
.It Em PF-Tag
Add a
.Xr pf 4
tag to all packets of phase 2 SAs created for this connection.
This will allow matching packets for this connection by defining
rules in
.Xr pf.conf 5
using the
.Em tagged
keyword.
.Pp
The following variables can be used in tags to include information
from the remote peer on runtime:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width $domain -compact -offset indent
.It Ar $id
The remote phase 1 ID.
It will be expanded to
.Ar id-type/id-value ,
e.g.\&
.Ar fqdn/foo.bar.org .
.It Ar $domain
Extract the domain from IDs of type FQDN or UFQDN.
.El
.Pp
For example, if the ID is
.Ar fqdn/foo.bar.org
or
.Ar ufqdn/user@bar.org ,
.Dq PF-Tag=ipsec-$domain
expands to
.Dq ipsec-bar.org .
The variable expansion for the
.Ar PF-Tag
directive occurs only at runtime, not during configuration file parse time.
.It Em Interface
Specify a
.Xr sec 4
interface minor number that the SAs will be used with.
Configuring
.Ar Interface
also disables the insertion of flows, and instead relies on the
routing of packets over the associated
.Xr sec 4
interface.
.El
.It Aq Sy IPsec-configuration
Parameters for IPsec configuration

.It Em PROTOCOL_ID
The protocol as given by the RFCs.
Acceptable values are currently
.Li IPSEC_AH
and
.Li IPSEC_ESP .
.It Em ReplayWindow
The size of the window used for replay protection.
This is normally left alone.
Look at the ESP and AH RFCs for a better description.
.It Em Transforms
A list of transforms usable for implementing the protocol.
Each of the list elements is a name of an
.Aq Sy IPsec-transform
section.
See below.
.El
.It Aq Sy IPsec-transform

being an ESP transform.
.It Em ENCAPSULATION_MODE
The encapsulation mode as given by the RFCs.
This means TRANSPORT or TUNNEL.
.It Em GROUP_DESCRIPTION
An optional (provides PFS if present) Diffie-Hellman group
description.
The values are the same as those for GROUP_DESCRIPTION in
.Aq Sy ISAKMP-transform
sections shown above.
.It Em KEY_LENGTH

.It Em TRANSFORM_ID
The transform ID as given by the RFCs, or ANY to denote that any
transform proposed will be accepted.
.El
.It Aq Sy IPsec-ID
Parameters for IPsec ID configuration
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Em Address
If the ID-type is
.Li IPV4_ADDR
or
.Li IPV6_ADDR ,
this tag should exist and be an IP address, an interface name, or the
.Em default
keyword.
If an interface is used, the first address of the appropriate
family will be used.
The
.Em default
keyword uses the interface associated with the default route.
In the case of IPv6, link-local addresses will be skipped if
addresses which are not link-local exist.
If the address on the interface changes,
.Xr isakmpd 8
will not track the change.
The configuration must be reloaded to learn the new address.
.It Em ID-type
The ID type as given by the RFCs.
For IPsec this is currently
.Li IPV4_ADDR ,
.Li IPV6_ADDR ,
.Li IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET ,
or
.Li IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET .
.It Em Netmask
If the ID-type is
.Li IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET
or
.Li IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET ,
this tag should exist and
be a network subnet mask or an interface.
When an interface is specified, the netmask is the mask associated with the
.Em Network .
The
.Em default
keyword uses the interface associated with the default route.
.It Em Network
If the ID-type is
.Li IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET
or
.Li IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET ,
this tag should exist and be a network address, an interface, or the

If the ID-type is

.Li IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET ,
.Li IPV6_ADDR ,
or
.Li IPV6_ADDR_SUBNET ,
this tag indicates what source or destination port is allowed to be
transported over the SA (depending on whether this is a local or
remote ID).
If left unspecified, all ports of the given transport protocol
will be transmitted (or permitted) over the SA.
The
.Em Protocol
tag must be specified in conjunction with this tag.
.It Em Protocol
If the ID-type is
.Li IPV4_ADDR ,
.Li IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET ,

.It Aq Sy IKECFG-ID
Parameters to use with IKE mode-config.
One ID per peer.
.Pp
An IKECFG-ID is written as [<ID-type>/<name>].
The following ID types are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "ASN1_DNXX" -offset indent -compact
.It IPv4
[ipv4/A.B.C.D]
.It IPv6
[ipv6/abcd:abcd::ab:cd]

[fqdn/foo.bar.org]
.It UFQDN
[ufqdn/user@foo.bar.org]
.It ASN1_DN
[asn1_dn//C=aa/O=cc/...] (Note the double slashes as the DN itself
starts with a
.Sq / . )
.El
.Pp
Each section specifies what configuration values to return to the peer
requesting IKE mode-config.
Currently supported values are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "WINS-serverXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Em Address
The peer's network address.
.It Em Netmask
The peer's netmask.
.It Em Nameserver
The IP address of a DNS nameserver.
.It Em WINS-server
The IP address of a WINS server.
.El
.It Aq Sy Initiator-ID
Parameters for peer initiator configuration
.Pp
During phase 1 negotiation
.Xr isakmpd 8
looks for a pre-shared key in the
.Aq Sy ISAKMP-peer
section.
If no Authentication data is specified in that section, and
.Xr isakmpd 8
is not the initiator, it looks for Authentication data in a section named after
the initiator's phase 1 ID.
This allows mobile users with dynamic IP addresses
to have different shared secrets.
.Pp
This only works for aggressive mode because in main mode the remote
initiator ID would not yet be known.
Note, however, that use of aggressive mode is discouraged.
See
.Sx CAVEATS ,
below.
.Pp
The name of the
.Aq Sy Initiator-ID
section depends on the ID type sent by the initiator.
Currently this can be:
.Pp

Using aggressive mode is discouraged due to various design problems.
If your peer only supports aggressive mode, consider replacing that
peer with a sane ISAKMP/IKE implementation.
For details see
.Lk http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/1999-12/features/harmful.html .
.Sh BUGS
The RFCs do not permit differing DH groups in the same proposal for
aggressive and quick mode exchanges.
Mixing both PFS and non-PFS suites in a quick mode proposal is not possible,
as PFS implies using a DH group.
