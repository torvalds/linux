Until we have a bug-tracking system setup, we might just add bugs to this
file:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* We need a death timeout on half-ready SAs just like exchanges.  At the
  moment we leak SAs.

* Quick mode establishments via UI using -P bind-addr gets "Address already in
  use".

* If the first proposal is turned down, the initiator gets confused.

* Renegotiation after a failed phase 1 fails.

* Rekeying is now done automatically on expirations, it should not.  The
  SAs should be brought up on-demand just like the first time.

* Notifications regarding exchange errors seems to not have the right SPI,
  at least not in phase 1, in NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN.

* Outgoing informational exchanges when we use INVALID_PAYLOAD_TYPE
  cause a DOI error.

* In Linux select(2) of named pipes seems broken as they will return as
  readable even when nothing is there after one read has succeeded.

* I have seen INITIAL-CONTACT sent on the second Main Mode.

* When ID mismatches occur, coredumps may follow, investigate!

* ESP+AH does not work properly

* Looping QM seen (due to lost sendpackets from other participant?)

* Teardown from UI does not remove exchanges.

* Wrong error message when policy check fails.

* Retransmit of QM (packet 1) after INFO/PAYLOAD_MALFORMED was received.

* SIGSEGV after sa_enter: sa added to sa list, trigged by DELETE notify (Linux)

* Passive connections, undefined local&remote IDs will cause IKE peer IDs
  to be used.

* host route support in KLIPS does not work properly

* When not having compiled in support for a certain crypto algorithm and
  the config file still tells us to propose it, we segfault.
