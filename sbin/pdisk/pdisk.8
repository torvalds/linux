.Dt PDISK 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pdisk
.Nd HFS(DPME) partition maintenance program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pdisk
.Op Fl lr
.Ar disk
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a menu driven program which partitions disks using the standard Apple
disk partitioning scheme described in
.Dq Inside Macintosh: Devices .
It does not support the Intel/DOS partitioning scheme supported by
.Xr fdisk 8 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
List the partition map for the specified
.Ar disk .
.It Fl r
Prevents
.Nm
from writing to the disk.
.It Ar disk
Specify the
.Ar disk
to operate on.
It can be specified either by its full pathname or an abbreviated disk form.
In its abbreviated form, the path to the device and the
.Sq r
denoting
.Dq raw device
are omitted, with the partition letter being optional.
For example, the first IDE disk can be specified as either
.Pa /dev/rwd0c ,
.Pa wd0c ,
or
.Pa wd0 .
.El
.Sh COMMAND MODE
The list of commands and their explanations are given below.
.Bl -tag -width "update"
.It Em ?\&
verbose command help
.It Em C
create a partition of a specified type
.It Em c
create an
.Ox
partition
.It Em d
delete a partition
.It Em f
full display of a partition
.It Em h
command help
.It Em i
(re)initialize the partition map
.It Em n
(re)name a partition
.It Em P
show the partition map's data structures
.It Em p
print the partition map
.It Em q
quit editing
.It Em r
reorder (swap) disk positions of two entries in the partition map
.It Em s
change the size of the partition map
.It Em t
change the type of a partition
.It Em w
write the partition map to disk
.El
.Pp
Commands which take arguments prompt for each argument not specified
in the original command.
You can type any number of the arguments separated by spaces.
.Pp
Partitions are always specified by their number,
which is the index of the partition entry in the partition map.
.Pp
The index numbers of partitions will change if partitions are created,
deleted or reordered.
.Pp
Creating more than fifteen partitions is not advised, for
compatibility reasons.
.Pp
The
.Em c
(create an
.Ox
partition) and
.Em C
(create a partition of a specified type)
commands are the only ones with complicated arguments.
.Pp
The first argument is the base address (in blocks) of the partition.
Besides a raw number, you can also specify a partition number followed
by the letter 'p' to indicate that the first block of the new partition should
be the same as the first block of that existing free space partition.
.Pp
The second argument is the length of the partition in blocks.
This can be a raw number or can be a partition number followed by the
letter 'p' to use the size of that partition or can be a number followed
by 'k', 'm', 'g', or 't' to indicate the size in kilobytes, megabytes,
gigabytes or terabytes respectively.
(These are powers of 1024, of course, not powers of 1000.)
.Pp
The third argument is the name of the partition.
This can be a single word without quotes, or a string surrounded by
single or double quotes.
.Pp
For the
.Em C
command only, the fourth argument is the partition type.
This can be a single word without quotes, or a string surrounded by
single or double quotes.
The
.Em c
command automatically uses the type
.Ox .
.Pp
The
.Em n
(name) command allows the name of a partition to be changed.
Note that the various "Apple_Driver" partitions depend
on the name field for proper functioning.
