# Sector size is the smallest unit of data which can be read or written.
# Making it too small decreases performance and decreases available space.
# Making it too large may prevent filesystems from working.  512 is the
# minimum and always safe.  For UFS, use the fragment size
#
sector_size	=	512

#
# Start and end of the encrypted section of the partition.  Specify in
# sector numbers.  If none specified, "all" will be assumed, to the
# extent the value of this can be established.
#
#first_sector	=	0
#last_sector	=	2879
#total_sectors	=	2880

#
# An encrypted partition can have more than one key.  It may be a good idea
# to make at least two keys, and save one of them for "just in case" use.
# The minimum is obviously one and the maximum is 4.
#
number_of_keys	=	4

#
# Flushing the partition with random bytes prevents a brute-force attack
# from skipping sectors which obviously contains un-encrypted data.
# NB: This variable is boolean, if it is present it means "yes" even if 
# you set it to the value "no"
