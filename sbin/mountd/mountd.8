.Sh NAME
.Nm mountd
.Nd service remote NFS mount requests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mountd
.Op Fl d
.Op Ar exportsfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the server for NFS mount requests from other client machines.
.Nm
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the NFS
server specification; see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC 1094, Appendix A and
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" ,
RFC 1813, Appendix I.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Enable debugging mode.
.Nm
will not detach from the controlling terminal and will print
debugging messages to stderr.
.It Ar exportsfile
The
.Ar exportsfile
argument specifies an alternate location
for the exports file.
.El
.Pp
When
.Nm
is started,
it loads the export host addresses and options into the kernel
using the
.Xr mount 2
system call.
After changing the exports file,
a hangup signal should be sent to the
.Nm
daemon
to get it to reload the export information.
After sending the
.Dv SIGHUP
(kill \-HUP `cat /var/run/mountd.pid`),
check the syslog output to see if
.Nm
logged any parsing
errors in the exports file.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/mountd.pid -compact
.It Pa /etc/exports
list of exported filesystems
.It Pa /var/db/mountdtab
list of exported filesystems currently mounted
.It Pa /var/run/mountd.pid
PID of the currently running
.Nm
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nfsstat 1 ,
.Xr exports 5 ,
.Xr nfsd 8 ,
.Xr portmap 8 ,
.Xr showmount 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.3 Reno .
.Pp
The
.Fl n
flag historically allowed clients to use non-reserved ports
when communicating with
.Nm .
In
.Ox ,
a reserved port is always used.
