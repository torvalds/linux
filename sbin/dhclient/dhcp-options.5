.Dt DHCP-OPTIONS 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcp-options
.Nd Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Dynamic Host Configuration protocol allows the client to receive
.Ic options
from the DHCP server describing the network configuration and various
services that are available on the network.
When configuring
.Xr dhcpd 8
or
.Xr dhclient 8 ,
options must often be declared.
The syntax for declaring options, and the names and formats of the options
that can be declared, are documented here.
.Sh REFERENCE: OPTION STATEMENTS
DHCP
.Ic option
statements always start with the
.Ic option
keyword, followed by an option name, followed by option data.
The option names and data formats are described below.
It is not necessary to exhaustively specify all DHCP options -
only those options which are needed by clients must be specified.
.Pp
Option data comes in a variety of formats, as defined below:
.Pp
The
.Ar ip-address
data type can be entered either as an explicit IP address
(e.g.,
.Li 239.254.197.10 )
or as a domain name (e.g.,
.Li haagen.isc.org ) .
A domain name must resolve to a single IP address.
.Pp
The
.Ar int32
data type specifies a signed 32-bit integer.
The
.Ar uint32
data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit integer.
The
.Ar int16
and
.Ar uint16
data types specify signed and unsigned 16-bit integers.
The
.Ar int8
and
.Ar uint8
data types specify signed and unsigned 8-bit integers.
Unsigned 8-bit integers are also sometimes referred to as octets.
.Pp
The
.Ar string
data type specifies an
.Tn NVT
.Pq Network Virtual Terminal
.Tn ASCII
string, which must be enclosed in double quotes - for example,
to specify a domain-name option, the syntax would be
.Pp
.Dl option domain-name \&"isc.org";
.Pp
The
.Ar flag
data type specifies a boolean value.
Booleans can be either
.Li true
or
.Li false
(or
.Li on
or
.Li off ,
if that makes more sense to you).
.Pp
The
.Ar data-string
data type specifies either an
.Tn NVT ASCII
string enclosed in double quotes, or a series of octets specified in
hexadecimal, separated by colons.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl option dhcp-client-identifier \&"CLIENT-FOO";
or
.Dl option dhcp-client-identifier 43:4c:49:45:54:2d:46:4f:4f;
.Pp
The documentation for the various options mentioned below is taken
from the IETF draft document on DHCP options, RFC 2132.
Options which are not listed by name may be defined by the name
.Li option- Ns Ar nnn ,
where
.Ar nnn
is the decimal number of the option code.
These options may be followed either by a string, enclosed in quotes, or by
a series of octets, expressed as two-digit hexadecimal numbers separated
by colons.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
option option-133 "my-option-133-text";
option option-129 1:54:c9:2b:47;
.Ed
.Pp
Because
.Xr dhcpd 8
does not know the format of these undefined option codes,
no checking is done to ensure the correctness of the entered data.
.Pp
The standard options are:
.Ss RFC 1497 Vendor Extensions
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic option subnet-mask Ar ip-address ;
The
.Ic subnet-mask
option specifies the client's subnet mask as per RFC 950.
If no subnet-mask option is provided anywhere in scope, as a last resort

will use the subnet mask from the subnet declaration for the network on
which an address is being assigned.
However,
.Em any
subnet-mask option declaration that is in scope for the address being
assigned will override the subnet mask specified in the subnet declaration.
