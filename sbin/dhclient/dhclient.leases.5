.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dhclient.leases
.Nd DHCP client lease database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Internet Software Consortium DHCP client keeps a persistent
database of leases that it has acquired that are still valid.
The database is a free-form ASCII file containing one valid declaration
per lease.
If more than one declaration appears for a given lease,
the last one in the file is used.
The file is written as a log, so this is not an unusual occurrence.
.Pp
The lease file is named
.Pa dhclient.leases. Ns Ar IFNAME ,
where
.Ar IFNAME
represents the network interface the DHCP client acquired the lease on.
For example, if
.Xr dhclient 8
is configured for the
.Li em0
network device,
the lease file will be named
.Pa dhclient.leases.em0 .
.Pp
The format of the lease declarations is described in
.Xr dhclient.conf 5 .
