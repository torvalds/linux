.Sh NAME
.Nm nfsiod
.Nd local
.Tn NFS
asynchronous I/O server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl n Ar num_servers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility controls the maximum number of
.Nm
kernel processes which run on an
.Tn NFS
client machine to service asynchronous I/O requests to its server.
Having
.Nm
kernel processes
improves performance but is not required for correct operation.
.Pp
The option is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl n
Specify how many processes are permitted to be started.
.El
.Pp
Without an option,
.Nm
displays the current settings.
A client should allow enough number of processes to handle its maximum
level of concurrency, typically four to six.
.Pp
If
.Nm
detects that the running kernel does not include
.Tn NFS
support, it will attempt to load a kernel module containing
.Tn NFS
code, using
.Xr kldload 2 .
If this fails, or no
.Tn NFS
module was available,
.Nm
exits with an error.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nfsstat 1 ,
.Xr kldload 2 ,
.Xr nfssvc 2 ,
.Xr mountd 8 ,
.Xr nfsd 8 ,
.Xr rpcbind 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Pp
Starting with
.Fx 5.0 ,
the utility no longer starts daemons, but only serves as a vfs
loader and
.Xr sysctl 3
wrapper.
