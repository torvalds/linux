.Sh NAME
.Nm ipsecctl
.Nd control flows for IPsec
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ipsecctl
.Op Fl cdFkmnv
.Op Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl i Ar fifo
.Op Fl s Ar modifier
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility controls flows that determine which packets are to be processed by
IPsec.
It allows ruleset configuration, and retrieval of status information from the
kernel's SPD (Security Policy Database) and SAD (Security Association
Database).
It also can control
.Xr isakmpd 8
and establish tunnels using automatic keying with
.Xr isakmpd 8 .
The ruleset grammar is described in
.Xr ipsec.conf 5 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Use in combination with the
.Fl s
option to collapse flow output.
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the ruleset.
.It Fl d
When the
.Fl d
option is set, specified flows will be deleted from the SPD.
Otherwise,
.Nm
will add flows.
.It Fl F
The
.Fl F
option flushes the SPD and the SAD.
.It Fl f Ar file
Load the rules contained in
.Ar file .
.It Fl i Ar fifo
If given, the
.Fl i
option specifies an alternate FIFO instead of
.Pa /var/run/isakmpd.fifo ,
used to talk to
.Xr isakmpd 8 .
.It Fl k
Show secret keying material when printing the active SAD entries.
.It Fl m
Continuously display all
.Dv PF_KEY
messages exchanged with the kernel.
.It Fl n
Do not actually load rules, just parse them.
.It Fl s Ar modifier
Show the kernel's databases, specified by
.Ar modifier
(may be abbreviated):
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxx -compact
.It Fl s Cm flow
Show the ruleset loaded into the SPD.
.It Fl s Cm sa
Show the active SAD entries.
.It Fl s Cm all
Show all of the above.
.El
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
A second use of
.Fl v
will produce even more verbose output.
