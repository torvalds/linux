.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a local GEOM Gate class consumer.
It can be used as a replacement for
.Xr md 4
devices or as a
.Dq GEOMificator
for non GEOM-aware devices, but it was mainly created as an example
on how to use and how to communicate with the GEOM Gate kernel subsystem.
.Pp
Available commands:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm destroy"
.It Cm create
Create a
.Nm ggate
provider related to the given regular file or device.
.It Cm destroy
Destroy the given
.Nm ggate
provider.
.It Cm list
List
.Nm ggate
providers.
.It Cm rescue
Take over a previously created provider and handle pending and future
requests.
This is useful if the initial
.Nm
process died.
To prevent data loss, the given path must lead to the
regular file or device that was used to create the provider.
.El
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl s Cm ro | wo | rw"
.It Fl f
Forcibly destroy
.Nm ggate
provider (cancels all pending requests).
.It Fl o Cm ro | wo | rw
Specify permissions to use when opening the file or device: read-only
.Pq Cm ro ,
write-only
.Pq Cm wo ,
or read-write
.Pq Cm rw .
Default is
.Cm rw .
.It Fl s Ar sectorsize
Sector size for
.Nm ggate
provider.
If not specified, it is taken from the device, or set to 512 bytes for files.
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Number of seconds to wait before an I/O request will be canceled.
0 means no timeout.
Default is 30.
.It Fl u Ar unit
Unit number to use.
.It Fl v
Do not fork, run in foreground and print debug information on standard
output.
.It Ar path
Path to a regular file or device.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
Exit status is 0 on success, or 1 if the command fails.
To get details about the failure,
.Nm
should be called with the
.Fl v
option.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dq GEOMify
the
.Dq Li fd0
device and use
.Xr gbde 8
to encrypt data on a floppy disk.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ggatel create -u 5 /dev/fd0
gbde init /dev/ggate5
gbde attach ggate5
newfs /dev/ggate5.bde
mount /dev/ggate5.bde /secret
cp /private/foo /secret/
umount /secret
gbde detach ggate5
