.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a network client for the GEOM Gate class.
It is responsible for the creation of
.Nm ggate
devices and forwarding I/O requests between the
.Nm GEOM Gate
kernel subsystem and the
.Xr ggated 8
network daemon.
Available commands:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm destroy"
.It Cm create
Connect to a
.Xr ggated 8
daemon on the specified host and create a
.Nm ggate
provider for the specified remote file or device.
.It Cm rescue
Create a new connection after the
.Nm
process has died or been killed.
The new connection to the
.Xr ggated 8
daemon handles pending and future requests.
.It Cm destroy
Destroy the given
.Nm ggate
provider.
.It Cm list
List
.Nm ggate
providers.
.El

Available options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl s Cm ro | wo | rw"
.It Fl f
Forcibly destroy
.Nm ggate
provider (cancels all pending requests).
.It Fl n
Do not use
.Dv TCP_NODELAY
option on TCP sockets.
.It Fl o Cm ro | wo | rw
Specify permissions to use when opening the file or device: read-only
.Pq Cm ro ,
write-only
.Pq Cm wo ,
or read-write
.Pq Cm rw .

start to be canceled.
Default is 1024.
.It Fl R Ar rcvbuf
Size of receive buffer to use.
Default is 131072 (128kB).
.It Fl S Ar sndbuf
Size of send buffer to use.
Default is 131072 (128kB).
.It Fl s Ar sectorsize
Sector size for

provider.
If not specified, it is taken from the device, or set to 512 bytes for files.
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Number of seconds to wait before an I/O request will be canceled.
Default is 0, which means no timeout.
