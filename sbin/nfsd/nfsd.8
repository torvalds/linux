.Sh NAME
.Nm nfsd
.Nd remote NFS server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nfsd
.Op Fl rtu
.Op Fl n Ar num_servers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
runs on a server machine to service NFS
requests from client machines.
At least one
.Nm
must be running for a machine to operate as a server.
.Pp
Unless otherwise specified, four servers for UDP
transport are started.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n Ar num_servers
Specifies how many servers to create (max 20).
.It Fl r
Register the NFS service with
.Xr portmap 8
without creating any servers.
This option can be used along with the
.Fl u
or
.Fl t
options to re-register NFS if the portmap server is restarted.
.It Fl t
Serve TCP NFS clients.
.It Fl u
Serve UDP NFS clients.
.El
.Pp
For example,
.Dq Li "nfsd -u -t -n 6"
serves UDP and TCP transports using six daemons.
.Pp
A server should run enough daemons to handle
the maximum level of concurrency from its clients,
typically four to six.
.Pp
.Nm
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the NFS
server specification; see RFCs 1094 and 1813.
