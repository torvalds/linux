.Dt KLDCONFIG 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kldconfig
.Nd display or modify the kernel module search path
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dfimnUv
.Op Fl S Ar sysctlname
.Op Ar path ...
.Nm
.Fl r
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
displays or modifies the search path used by the kernel when loading modules
using the
.Xr kldload 8
utility or the
.Xr kldload 2
syscall.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Remove the specified paths from the module search path.
.It Fl f
Do not display a diagnostic message if a path specified for adding is
already present in the search path, or if a path specified for removing
is not present in the search path.
This may be useful in startup/shutdown scripts for adding a path to
a file system which is still not mounted, or in shutdown scripts for
unconditionally removing a path that may have been added during startup.
.It Fl i
Add the specified paths to the beginning of the search path, not to the end.
This option can only be used when adding paths.
.It Fl m
Instead of replacing the module search path with the set of paths
specified,
.Dq merge
in the new entries.
.It Fl n
Do not actually change the module search path.
.It Fl r
Display the current search path.
This option cannot be used if any paths are also specified.
.It Fl S Ar sysctlname
Specify the sysctl name to use instead of the default
.Va kern.module_path .
.It Fl U
.Dq Unique-ify
the current search path - if any of the directories is repeated one
or more times, only the first occurrence remains.
This option implies
.Fl m .
.It Fl v
Verbose output: display the new module search path.
If the path has been changed, and the
.Fl v
flag is specified more than once, the old path is displayed as well.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pa /boot/kernel , /boot/modules , /modules
The default module search path used by the kernel.
