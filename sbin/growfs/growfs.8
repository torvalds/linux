.Sh NAME
.Nm growfs
.Nd expand an existing UFS file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Ny
.Op Fl s Ar size
.Ar special | filesystem
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility makes it possible to expand an UFS file system.
Before running
.Nm
the partition or slice containing the file system must be extended using
.Xr gpart 8 .
If you are using volumes you must enlarge them by using
.Xr gvinum 8 .
The
.Nm
utility extends the size of the file system on the specified special file.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl N
.Dq Test mode .
Causes the new file system parameters to be printed out without actually
enlarging the file system.
.It Fl y
Causes
.Nm
to assume yes
as the answer to all operator questions.
.It Fl s Ar size
Determines the
.Ar size
of the file system after enlarging in sectors.
.Ar Size
is the number of 512 byte sectors unless suffixed with a
.Cm b , k , m , g ,
or
.Cm t
which
denotes byte, kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte and terabyte respectively.
This value defaults to the size of the raw partition specified in
.Ar special
(in other words,
.Nm
will enlarge the file system to the size of the entire partition).
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Expand root file system to fill up available space:
.Dl growfs /
.Pp
Refresh the LUN size, resize the partition to use all available
capacity, and expand the filesystem accordingly:
.Dl camcontrol reprobe da0
.Dl gpart recover da0
.Dl gpart resize -i 1 da0
.Dl growfs /dev/da0p1
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr camcontrol 8 ,
.Xr fsck 8 ,
.Xr gpart 8 ,
.Xr newfs 8 ,
.Xr tunefs 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Fx 4.4 .
The ability to resize mounted file systems was added in
.Fx 10.0 .

.Sh CAVEATS
When expanding a file system mounted read-write, any writes to that file system
will be temporarily suspended until the expansion is finished.
.Sh BUGS
Normally
.Nm
writes cylinder group summary to disk and reads it again later for doing more
updates.
This read operation will provide unexpected data when using
.Fl N .
Therefore, this part cannot really be simulated and will be skipped in test
mode.
