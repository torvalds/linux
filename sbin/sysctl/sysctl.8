.Sh NAME
.Nm sysctl
.Nd get or set kernel state
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sysctl
.Op Fl Aanq
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Ar name Ns Oo = Ns Ar value Oc Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility retrieves kernel state and allows processes with
appropriate privilege to set kernel state.
The state to be retrieved or set is described using a
.Dq Management Information Base
.Pq MIB
style name, using a dotted set of components.
.Pp
When retrieving a variable,
a subset of the MIB name may be specified to retrieve a list of
variables in that subset.
For example, to list all the machdep variables:
.Pp
.Dl $ sysctl machdep
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Fl A
List all the known MIB names including tables.
Those with string or integer values will be printed as with the
.Fl a
flag; for the table values, the name of the utility to retrieve them is given.
.It Fl a
List all the currently available string or integer values.
This is the default, if no parameters are given to
.Nm .
.It Fl f Ar file
Process
.Ar name Ns Op = Ns Ar value
arguments from
.Ar file
in
.Xr sysctl.conf 5
format.
.It Fl n
Suppress printing of the field name, only output the field value.
Useful for setting shell variables.
For example, to set the psize shell variable to the pagesize of the hardware:
.Pp
.Dl # set psize=`sysctl -n hw.pagesize`
.It Fl q
Suppress all output when setting a variable.
This option overrides the behaviour of
.Fl n .
.It Ar name Ns Op = Ns Ar value
Retrieve the specified variable
.Ar name ,
or attempt to set it to
.Ar value .
Multiple
.Ar name Ns Op = Ns Ar value
arguments may be given.
If given,
.Fl f Ar file
is processed first.
.El
.Pp
The information available from
.Nm
consists of integers, strings, and tables.
For a detailed description of the variables, see
.Xr sysctl 2 .
Tables can only be retrieved by special purpose programs such as
.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr systat 1 ,
and
.Xr netstat 1 .
.Pp
.Nm
can extract information about the filesystems that have been compiled
into the running system.
This information can be obtained by using the command:
.Pp
.Dl $ sysctl vfs.mounts
.Pp
By default, only filesystems that are actively being used are listed.
Use of the
.Fl A
flag lists all the filesystems compiled into the running kernel.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/sysctl.confXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl variables to set at system startup
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To retrieve the maximum number of processes allowed
in the system:
.Pp
.Dl $ sysctl kern.maxproc
.Pp
To set the maximum number of processes allowed
in the system to 1000:
.Pp
.Dl # sysctl kern.maxproc=1000
.Pp
To retrieve information about the system clock rate:
.Pp
.Dl $ sysctl kern.clockrate
.Pp
To retrieve information about the load average history:
.Pp
.Dl $ sysctl vm.loadavg
.Pp
To set the list of reserved TCP ports that should not be allocated
by the kernel dynamically:
.Pp
.Dl # sysctl net.inet.tcp.baddynamic=749,750,751,760,761,871
.Dl # sysctl net.inet.udp.baddynamic=749,750,751,760,761,871,1024-2048
.Pp
This can be used to keep daemons
from stealing a specific port that another program needs to function.
List elements may be separated by commas and/or whitespace;
a hyphen may be used to specify a range of ports.
.Pp
It is also possible to add or remove ports from the current list:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# sysctl net.inet.tcp.baddynamic=+748,+6000-6999
# sysctl net.inet.tcp.baddynamic=-871
.Ed
.Pp
To set the amount of shared memory available in the system and
the maximum number of shared memory segments:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# sysctl kern.shminfo.shmmax=33554432
# sysctl kern.shminfo.shmseg=32
.Ed
.Pp
To place core dumps from
.Xr issetugid 2
programs (in this example
.Xr bgpd 8 )
into a safe place for debugging purposes:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# mkdir -m 700 /var/crash/bgpd
# sysctl kern.nosuidcoredump=3
