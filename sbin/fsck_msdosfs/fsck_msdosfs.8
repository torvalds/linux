.Sh NAME
.Nm fsck_msdosfs
.Nd DOS/Windows (FAT) file system consistency checker
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl p
.Op Fl Cf
.Ar filesystem ...
.Nm
.Op Fl Cny
.Ar filesystem ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility verifies and repairs
.Tn FAT
file systems (more commonly known
as
.Tn DOS
file systems).
.Pp
The first form of
.Nm
preens the specified file systems.
It is normally started by
.Xr fsck 8
run from
.Pa /etc/rc
during automatic reboot, when a FAT file system is detected.
When preening file systems,
.Nm
will fix common inconsistencies non-interactively.
If more serious problems are found,
.Nm
does not try to fix them, indicates that it was not
successful, and exits.
.Pp
The second form of
.Nm
checks the specified file systems and tries to repair all
detected inconsistencies, requesting confirmation before
making any changes.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl C
Compatibility with the corresponding
.Xr fsck 8
option (skip check if clean), defined to no-op.
.It Fl F
Compatibility with the wrapper
.Xr fsck 8
which seeks to determine whether the file system needs to be cleaned
immediately in foreground, or if its cleaning can be deferred to background.
FAT (MS-DOS) file systems must always be cleaned in the foreground.
A non-zero exit code is always returned for this option.
.It Fl f
Force
.Nm
to check
.Dq clean
file systems when preening.
.It Fl n
Causes
.Nm
to assume
.Dq Li no
as the answer to all operator
questions, except
.Dq Li CONTINUE? .
.It Fl p
Preen the specified file systems.
.It Fl y
Causes
.Nm
to assume
.Dq Li yes
as the answer to all operator questions.
