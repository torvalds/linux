.Sh NAME
.Nm ffsinfo
.Nd "dump all meta information of an existing ufs file system"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl g Ar cylinder_group
.Op Fl i Ar inode
.Op Fl l Ar level
.Op Fl o Ar outfile
.Ar special | file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility extends the
.Xr dumpfs 8
utility.
.Pp
The output is appended to the file
.Pa outfile .
Also expect the output file to be rather large.
Up to 2 percent of the size of the specified file system is not uncommon.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl g Ar cylinder_group
This restricts the dump to information about this cylinder group only.
Here
.Ar 0
means the first cylinder group and
.Ar -1
the last one.
.It Fl i Ar inode
This restricts the dump to information about this particular inode only.
Here the minimum acceptable inode is
.Ar 2 .
If this option is omitted but a cylinder group is defined then only inodes
within that cylinder group are dumped.
.It Fl l Ar level
The level of detail which will be dumped.
This value defaults to
.Ar 255
and is the
.Dq bitwise or
of the following table:
.Pp
.Bl -hang -width indent -compact
.It Ar 0x001
initial superblock
.It Ar 0x002
superblock copies in each cylinder group
.It Ar 0x004
cylinder group summary in initial cylinder group
.It Ar 0x008
cylinder group information
.It Ar 0x010
inode allocation bitmap
.It Ar 0x020
fragment allocation bitmap
.It Ar 0x040
cluster maps and summary
.It Ar 0x100
inode information
.It Ar 0x200
indirect block dump
.El
.It Fl o Ar outfile
This sets the output filename where the dump is written to, and
must be specified.
If
.Fl
is provided, output will be sent to stdout.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl ffsinfo -o /var/tmp/ffsinfo -l 1023 /dev/vinum/testvol
.Pp
will dump
.Pa /dev/vinum/testvol
to
.Pa /var/tmp/ffsinfo
with all available information.

utility first appeared in

.Sh BUGS
Snapshots are handled like plain files.
They should get their own level to provide for independent control of the
amount of what gets dumped.
It probably also makes sense to some extend to dump the snapshot as a
file system.
