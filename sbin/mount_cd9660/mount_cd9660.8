.Dt MOUNT_CD9660 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_cd9660
.Nd mount an ISO 9660 filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_cd9660
.Op Fl egjR
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl s Ar offset
.Ar special node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches the ISO 9660 filesystem residing on the device
.Ar special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location indicated by
.Ar node .
The filesystem is always mounted readonly.
This command is invoked by
.Xr mount 8
when using the syntax
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Nm mount Op options
-t cd9660
.Ar special node
.Ed
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e
Enable the use of extended attributes.
.It Fl g
Do not strip version numbers on files.
(By default, if there are files with different version numbers on the disk,
only the last one will be listed.)
In either case, files may be opened without explicitly stating a
version number.
.It Fl j
Do not use any Joliet extensions included in the filesystem.
.It Fl o Ar options
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the
.Xr mount 8
man page for possible options and their meanings.
.It Fl R
Do not use any Rockridge extensions included in the filesystem.
.It Fl s Ar offset
Use the session starting at
.Ar offset
(counted in 2048-byte blocks from the start of the media) instead of
the last session from the Table of Contents (TOC).
The TOC can be inspected by using
.Xr cdio 1 .

.Xr vnconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The cd9660 filesystem does not support the original "High Sierra"
("CDROM001") format.
.Pp
POSIX device node mapping is currently not supported.
.Pp
Version numbers are not stripped if Rockridge extensions are in use.
In this case, accessing files that don't have Rockridge names without
version numbers gets the one with the lowest version number and not
the one with the highest.
.Pp
There is no ECMA support.
