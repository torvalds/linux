.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
allows a user or system administrator to issue commands to and otherwise
control devices which reside on standard IDE and ATA controllers.
It is used by specifying
a device to manipulate, a command to perform, and any arguments
the command may require.
.Pp
.Nm
supports the following commands:
acousticdisable,
acousticset,
apmdisable,
apmset,
checkpower,
dump,
identify (the default),
idle,
poddisable,
podenable,
puisdisable,
puisenable,
puisspinup,
readaheaddisable,
readaheadenable,
readattr,
secdisablepass,
secerase,
secfreeze,
secsetpass,
secunlock,
setidle,
setstandby,
sleep,
smartautosave,
smartdisable,
smartenable,
smartoffline,
smartread,
smartreadlog,
smartstatus,
standby,
writecachedisable,
and
writecacheenable.
.Pp
Support for
Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART) functionality
is indicated by the device with
.Sq SMART feature set
in the output of the
.Li identify
command.
SMART commands and the
.Li readattr
command are for experts only.
.Pp
Support for
Security Mode functionality
is indicated by the device with
.Sq Security Mode feature set
in the output of the
.Li identify
command.
.Em Be very careful
while playing with these commands:
loss of the user and master passwords for the device will result
in an inaccessible device.
.Pp
A full description of the commands follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxx -compact
.It Li acousticdisable
Disables support for automatic acoustic management on the specified device.
Note that devices supporting automatic acoustic management may refuse to
disable it, resulting in an
.Sq ATA device returned Aborted Command
warning.
.Pp
.It Li acousticset Ar acoustic-management-level
Enables and sets the automatic acoustic management level to the requested
level on the specified device (if supported).
Device performance may
increase with increasing automatic acoustic management levels at the cost of
potentially generating more noise and requiring more power.
Valid values are 0 up to and including 126.
Support for automatic acoustic management is indicated by the device with
.Sq Automatic Acoustic Management feature set
in the output of the
.Li identify
command.
.Pp
.It Li apmdisable
Disables support for advanced power management on the specified device.
Note that devices supporting advanced power management may refuse to
disable it, resulting in an
.Sq ATA device returned Aborted Command
warning.
.Pp
.It Li apmset Ar power-management-level
Enables and sets the advanced power management level to the requested
level on the specified device (if supported).
Device performance may
increase with increasing power management levels at the cost of
potentially requiring more power.
Values up to and including 126 allow
the device to go into standby mode and spin-down the disk.
This
.Em may cause disk time-outs
and is therefore
.Em not
recommended.
These values are more suitable optimization for low power
usage on infrequently used devices.
Values 127 up to and including 253 do not allow the device to go to
standby mode and are more suitable for optimization for performance.
Support for advanced power management is indicated by the device with
.Sq Advanced Power Management feature set
in the output of the
.Li identify
command.
.Pp
.It Li checkpower
Will print out if the device is in Active, Idle, or Standby power
management mode.
.Pp
.It Li dump
Extracts the records about issued ATA commands from the log buffer.
The log buffer is cleared after extraction.
.Pp
.It Li identify
Identify the specified device, displaying the device's vendor, product,
revision strings, supported capabilities and enabled capabilities.
This command is the default.
.Pp
.It Li idle
Place the specified device into Idle mode.
This mode may consume less power than Active mode.
.Pp
.It Li poddisable
Disallows the specified device to revert to power-on default (pod) settings
after a software reset.
In other words this permits the settings that have been modified since
power-on to remain after a software reset.
.Pp
.It Li podenable
Allows the specified device to revert to power-on default (pod) settings
after a software reset.
.Pp
.It Li puisdisable
Disables power-up in standby (puis) on the specified device, causing the
device to spin up the disks after power-up.
This should be the factory
default setting of the device and it is recommended to leave this
setting disabled.
.Pp
.It Li puisenable
Enables power-up in standby (puis) on the specified device, causing the
device to wait while spinning up the disks after power-up.
This may cause problems at boot if the device is too slow in spin-up.
This option is therefore
.Em not recommended
unless the implications are understood.
Note that the power-up in standby mode stays enabled over power-downs,
hardware and software resets.
Support for power-up in standby is indicated by the device with
.Sq Power-up in standby feature set
in the output of the
.Li identify
command.
.Pp
.It Li puisspinup
Explicitly spins up the device if power-up in standby (puis) mode
is enabled.
.Pp
.It Li readaheaddisable
Disables read look-ahead on the specified device.
This may decrease performance.
Note that the device may use
.Sq vendor specific
behaviour in implementing this, so it is
.Em not
recommended to issue this command on a disk containing any currently
mounted filesystems.
.Pp
.It Li readaheadenable
Enables read look-ahead on the specified device.
This may increase performance.
Support for and status of read look-ahead is indicated by
the device with
.Sq read look-ahead
in the output of the
.Li identify
command.
.Pp
.It Li readattr
Displays attribute thresholds and values for the specified device.
Besides attribute values, device vendors may provide additional information
shown in the last column,
.Dq Raw .
Attributes names can be completely wrong since they vary between vendors and
even models, so don't rely on it.
SMART must be enabled while executing this command or the device will return
an error.
.Pp
.It Li secdisablepass Ar user | master
Disables the lock mode for the specified device with user or master password.
This command won't change the master password.
The master password will be reactivated when a user password is set.
.Pp
.It Li secerase Ar user | master Oo
.Ar enhanced
.Oc
Erases all user data and unlocks the specified device.
Execution of this command with the master password is the only way to unlock a
device locked at maximum security level with the
.Li secsetpass
command if the user's password is lost or unknown.
There are two erase modes: normal and enhanced.
Default erase mode is normal.
In the normal erase mode this command will write binary zeroes to
all user data areas.
The enhanced erase mode is optional and may not be supported by the device.
When enhanced erase mode is specified, the device will write predetermined
data patterns to all user data areas.
In enhanced erase mode, all previously written user data will be overwritten,
including sectors that are no longer in use due to reallocation.
This command will disable the device lock mode, however, the master password
will still be stored internally within the device and may be reactivated later
when a new user password is set.
.Pp
.It Li secfreeze
Prevents changes to passwords until a following power cycle.
The purpose of this command is to prevent password setting attacks on the
security system.
After command completion any other commands that update the device lock mode
will be aborted.
.Pp
.It Li secsetpass Ar user high | maximum
.It Li secsetpass Ar master
Sets password and security level for the specified device.
There are two passwords, user and master, and two security levels, high and
maximum.
The maximum password length is 32 symbols.
The security system is enabled by sending a user password to the device with
this command.
When the security system is enabled, access to user data on the device is
denied after a power cycle until the user password is sent to the device with
the
.Li secunlock
command.
A master password may be set in addition to the user password.
The purpose of the master password is to allow an administrator to establish
a password that is kept secret from the user, and which may be used to unlock
the device if the user password is lost.
Setting the master password does not enable security system.
Each master password change decrements the master password revision
code value which is displayed in the
.Li identify
command output if supported.
After value 0x0001 is reached, the next value will be 0xfffe.
The security level determines device behavior when the master password is used
to unlock the device.
When the security level is set to high, the device requires the
.Li secunlock
command if the master password is used to unlock.
When the security level is set to maximum, the device requires a
.Li secerase
command if the master password is used to unlock it.
Execution of the
.Li secerase
command erases all user data on the device.
.Pp
.It Li secunlock Ar user | master
Unlocks the specified device with user or master password.
The device will always unlock if a valid user password is received.
If the security level was set to high during the last
.Li secsetpass
command, the device will unlock if the master password is received.
If the security level was set to maximum during the last
.Li secsetpass
command, the device won't unlock even if the master password is received.
.Pp
.It Li setidle Ar idle-timer
Places the specified device into Idle mode, and sets the Idle timer to
.Ar idle-timer
seconds.
A value of 0 will disable the Idle timer.
.Pp
.It Li setstandby Ar standby-timer
Places the specified device into Standby mode, and sets the Standby timer
to
.Ar standby-timer
seconds.
A value of 0 will disable the Standby timer.
.Pp
.It Li sleep
Place the specified device into Sleep mode.
This mode will consume less power than Standby mode,
but requires a device reset to resume operation.
Typically the
.Xr wd 4
driver performs this reset automatically, but this should still be
used with caution.
.Pp
.It Li smartautosave Ar enable | disable
Enables/disables attribute autosave feature on the specified device.
.Pp
.It Li smartdisable
Disables support for SMART on the specified device.
Note that this means that the device will no longer record any SMART
information.
.Pp
Note that SMART
.Em must
be enabled while executing the following commands or the device will
return an error.
.Pp
.It Li smartenable
Enables SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) on the
specified device (if supported).
This causes the device to record information
for prediction of device degradation and/or faults.
.Pp
.It Li smartoffline Ar subcommand
Causes the specified device to immediately initiate the optional set of
activities that collect SMART data in off-line mode and then save this data
to the device's non-volatile memory, or execute self-diagnostic test
routines in either captive or off-line mode.
The
.Ar subcommand
may be one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Em abort
Abort off-line mode self-test routine.
.Pp
.It Em collect
Start SMART off-line data collection immediately.
.Pp
.It Em extencaptive
Execute SMART extended self-test routine immediately in captive mode.
.Pp
.It Em extenoffline
Execute SMART extended self-test routine immediately in off-line mode.
.Pp
.It Em shortcaptive
Execute SMART short self-test routine immediately in captive mode.
.Pp
.It Em shortoffline
Execute SMART short self-test routine immediately in off-line mode.
.El
.Pp
Note that executing self-test routines in captive mode causes the device to
be not accessible until the routine completes.
This option is therefore
.Em not recommended
unless the implications are understood.
.Pp
.It Li smartread
Reads various SMART information from the specified device and prints it to
stdout.
.Pp
.It Li smartreadlog Ar log
Reads specified
.Ar log
and prints it to stdout.
The
.Ar log
may be one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "directoryXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Em comp
The comprehensive error log.
.It Em directory
The error log directory.
.It Em selftest
The self-test log.
.It Em summary
The summary error log.
.El
.Pp
.It Li smartstatus
Reads the reliability status of the specified device.
If the device reports
that one of its thresholds is exceeded (a strong indication of imminent
failure), the warning
.Sq SMART threshold exceeded!\&
is printed to stderr and a status of 2 is returned.
.Pp
.It Li standby
Place the specified device into Standby mode.
This mode will consume less power than Idle mode.
.Pp
.It Li writecachedisable
Disable the write cache on the specified device (if supported).
This may decrease performance.
Support for and status of write caching is indicated by the device with
.Sq write cache
in the output of the
.Li identify
command.
.Pp
.It Li writecacheenable
Enables the write cache on the specified device (if supported).
This may increase performance, however data still in the device's cache at
powerdown
.Em may be lost .
The
.Xr wd 4
driver performs a cache flush automatically before shutdown.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Display the vendor, product, revision strings, and capabilities (such as
SMART support) as reported by
.Pa /dev/wd0 :
.Pp
.Dl # atactl /dev/wd0c identify
.Pp
Enable SMART support on
.Pa /dev/wd0
for detection of early warning signs of device failure:
.Pp
.Dl # atactl /dev/wd0c smartenable
.Pp
A
.Xr crontab 5
entry which queries
.Pa /dev/wd0
each hour for early warning signs of failure.
If the device exceeds one of the SMART thresholds,
.Nm
will output
.Sq SMART threshold exceeded!\&
to stderr and
.Xr cron 8
will mail it.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Ox 2.6 .
Support for acoustic management, advanced power management, power-up in
standby, read look-ahead, and SMART was added in
.Ox 2.9 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
command was written by
.An Ken Hornstein .
It was based heavily on the scsictl command written by
.An Jason R. Thorpe .
Support for acoustic management, advanced power management, power-up in
standby, read look-ahead, and SMART was added by
.An Wouter Slegers .
.Sh CAVEATS
Not all devices are created equally.
Some may not support the feature sets
and/or commands needed to perform the requested action, even when the
.Li identify
command indicates support for the requested action.
The device will typically respond with an
.Sq ATA device returned Aborted Command
if the requested action is not supported.
Similarly a device might not implement all commands in a feature set,
so even though disabling a feature works, enabling might not.
.Sh BUGS
The output from the
.Li identify
command is rather ugly.
.Pp
Disabling read look-ahead with
.Li readaheaddisable
might cause problems with mounted filesystems on that device.
