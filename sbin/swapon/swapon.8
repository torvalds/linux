.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm swapon , swapoff
and
.Nm swapctl
utilities are used to control swap devices in the system.
At boot time all swap entries in
.Pa /etc/fstab
are added automatically when the system goes multi-user.
Swap devices use a fixed interleave; the maximum number of devices
is unlimited.
There is no priority mechanism.
.Pp
The
.Nm swapon
utility adds the specified swap devices to the system.
If the
.Fl a
option is used, all swap devices in
.Pa /etc/fstab
will be added, unless their
.Dq noauto
or
.Dq late
option is also set.
If the
.Fl L
option is specified,
swap devices with the
.Dq late
option will be added as well as ones with no option.
If the
.Fl q
option is used,
informational messages will not be
written to standard output when a swap device is added.
.Pp
The
.Nm swapoff
utility removes the specified swap devices from the system.
If the
.Fl a
option is used, all swap devices in
.Pa /etc/fstab
will be removed, unless their
.Dq noauto
option is also set.
If the
.Fl L
option is specified,
only swap devices with the
.Dq late
option will be removed.
If the
.Fl q
option is used,
informational messages will not be
written to standard output when a swap device is removed.
Note that
.Nm swapoff
will fail and refuse to remove a swap device if there is insufficient
VM (memory + remaining swap devices) to run the system.
The
.Nm swapoff
utility
must move swapped pages out of the device being removed which could
lead to high system loads for a period of time, depending on how
much data has been swapped out to that device.
.Pp
Other options supported by both
.Nm swapon
and
.Nm swapoff
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl F Ar fstab
Specify the
.Pa fstab
file to use.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm swapctl
utility exists primarily for those familiar with other
.Bx Ns s
and may be
used to add, remove, or list swap devices.
Note that the
.Fl a
option is used differently in
.Nm swapctl
and indicates that a specific list of devices should be added.
The
.Fl d
option indicates that a specific list should be removed.
The
.Fl A
and
.Fl U
options to
.Nm swapctl
operate on all swap entries in
.Pa /etc/fstab
which do not have their
.Dq noauto
option set.
.Pp
Swap information can be generated using the
.Xr swapinfo 8
utility,
.Nm pstat
.Fl s ,
or
.Nm swapctl
.Fl l .
The
.Nm swapctl
utility has the following options for listing swap:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl h
Output values in human-readable form.
.It Fl g
Output values in gigabytes.
.It Fl k
Output values in kilobytes.
.It Fl m
Output values in megabytes.
.It Fl l
List the devices making up system swap.
.It Fl s
Print a summary line for system swap.
.Pp
The
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
environment variable is used if not specifically
overridden.
512 byte blocks are used by default.
