/**
 * \file
 *
 * This file contains functions to resolve DNS queries and
 * validate the answers. Synchronously and asynchronously.
 *
 * Several ways to use this interface from an application wishing
 * to perform (validated) DNS lookups.
 *
 * All start with
 *	ctx = ub_ctx_create();
 *	err = ub_ctx_add_ta(ctx, "...");
 *	err = ub_ctx_add_ta(ctx, "...");
 *	... some lookups
 *	... call ub_ctx_delete(ctx); when you want to stop.
 *
 * Application not threaded. Blocking.
 *	int err = ub_resolve(ctx, "www.example.com", ...
 *	if(err) fprintf(stderr, "lookup error: %s\n", ub_strerror(err));
 *	... use the answer
 *
 * Application not threaded. Non-blocking ('asynchronous').
 *      err = ub_resolve_async(ctx, "www.example.com", ... my_callback);
 *	... application resumes processing ...
 *	... and when either ub_poll(ctx) is true
 *	... or when the file descriptor ub_fd(ctx) is readable,
 *	... or whenever, the app calls ...
 *	ub_process(ctx);
 *	... if no result is ready, the app resumes processing above,
 *	... or process() calls my_callback() with results.
 *
 *      ... if the application has nothing more to do, wait for answer
 *      ub_wait(ctx);
 *
 * Application threaded. Blocking.
 *	Blocking, same as above. The current thread does the work.
 *	Multiple threads can use the *same context*, each does work and uses
 *	shared cache data from the context.
 *
 * Application threaded. Non-blocking ('asynchronous').
 *	... setup threaded-asynchronous config option
 *	err = ub_ctx_async(ctx, 1);
 *	... same as async for non-threaded
 *	... the callbacks are called in the thread that calls process(ctx)
 *
 * Openssl needs to have locking in place, and the application must set
 * it up, because a mere library cannot do this, use the calls
 * CRYPTO_set_id_callback and CRYPTO_set_locking_callback.
 *
 * If no threading is compiled in, the above async example uses fork(2) to
 * create a process to perform the work. The forked process exits when the
 * calling process exits, or ctx_delete() is called.
 * Otherwise, for asynchronous with threading, a worker thread is created.
 *
 * The blocking calls use shared ctx-cache when threaded. Thus
 * ub_resolve() and ub_resolve_async() && ub_wait() are
 * not the same. The first makes the current thread do the work, setting
 * up buffers, etc, to perform the work (but using shared cache data).
 * The second calls another worker thread (or process) to perform the work.
 * And no buffers need to be set up, but a context-switch happens.
