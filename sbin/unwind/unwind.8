.Sh NAME
.Nm unwind
.Nd validating DNS resolver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dnv
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl s Ar socket
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a validating DNS resolver.
It is intended to run on client machines like workstations or laptops and only
listens on localhost.
.Pp
.Nm
sends DNS queries to nameservers to answer queries.
If it detects that DNS queries are blocked by the local network,
it can switch to resolvers learned through autoconfiguration.
It periodically probes if DNS is no longer blocked and switches back to
querying nameservers itself.
A list of sources for proposals learned through autoconfiguration
is documented in
.Xr resolvd 8 .
.Pp
.Nm
keeps the DNS answers in a cache shared by the different DNS name
server types.
.Nm
manages the cache size by deleting oldest entries when needed.
The cache is non-configurable and is lost upon process restart.
.Pp
To have
.Nm
enabled at boot time, use
.Dq rcctl enable unwind ,
which sets
.Pp
.Dl unwind_flags=\(dq\(dq
.Pp
in
.Xr rc.conf.local 8 .
.Pp
A running
.Nm
can be controlled with the
.Xr unwindctl 8
utility.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl s Ar socket
Use an alternate location for the default control socket.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
Multiple
.Fl v
options increase the verbosity.
Debug output from libunbound is only available when logging to
.Em stderr .

.Sh FILES

Trust anchor for DNSSEC validation.
.It Pa /dev/unwind.sock
