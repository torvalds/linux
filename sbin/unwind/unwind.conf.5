.Sh NAME
.Nm unwind.conf
.Nd validating DNS resolver configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr unwind 8
daemon is a validating DNS resolver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
config file is divided into the following main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sx Macros
Definitions of variables that can be used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sx Global configuration
Global settings for
.Xr unwind 8 .
.El
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword.
.Ss Macros
A macro is defined with a command of the form
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value .
The macro
.Ar name
can contain letters, digits, and underscores and cannot be a reserved word
(for example,
.Ic forwarder ,
.Ic port ,
or
.Ic DoT ) .
Within unquoted arguments, the string
.Pf $ Ar name
is later expanded to
.Ar value .
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
fwd1=192.0.2.53
fwd2=192.0.2.153
forwarder { $fwd1 $fwd2 }
.Ed
.Ss Global configuration
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic block list Ar file Op Cm log
A file containing domains to block, one per line.
If a domain from this list is queried,
.Nm unwind
answers with a return code of
.Dv REFUSED .
With
.Cm log
blocked queries are logged.
The list supports limited wildcard syntax: domains starting with . (dot)
are treated as any subdomains on that zone.
.It Ic forwarder Brq Ar address Oo Ic port Ar number Oc Oo Oo Ic authentication name Ar name Oc Ic DoT Oc ...
A list of addresses of DNS name servers to forward queries to.
.Ic port
defaults to 53.
If
.Ic DoT
is specified, use DNS over TLS when sending queries to the server at
.Ar address .
The default
.Ic port
is 853.
.Ar name
validates the certificate of the DNS over TLS server.
.It Ic preference Brq Ar type ...
A list of DNS name server types to specify the order in which
name servers are picked when measured round-trip time medians are equal.
Additionally, the first mentioned type gets a time bonus.
Validating name servers are always picked over non-validating name servers.
DNS name server types are,
in default order of preference:
.Bl -tag -width "oDoT-forwarder"
.It Ic DoT
DNS over TLS name servers configured in
.Nm .
.It Ic oDoT-forwarder
Name servers configured in
.Nm .
.Nm unwind
tries to opportunistically use DNS over TLS.
.It Ic forwarder
Name servers configured in
.Nm .
.It Ic recursor
.Nm unwind
itself recursively resolves names.
.It Ic oDoT-autoconf
Name servers learned from autoconfiguration.
A list of sources for proposals learned through autoconfiguration
is documented in
.Xr resolvd 8 .
.Nm unwind
tries to opportunistically use DNS over TLS.
.It Ic autoconf
Name servers learned from autoconfiguration.
.It Ic stub
Name servers learned from autoconfiguration,
queried using the libc functions
(see
.Xr asr_run 3 ) .
Will never validate.
Useful when running behind broken middle boxes that do not like edns0.
DNS answers from stub name servers are not cached.
.El
.It Ic force Oo Cm accept bogus Oc Ar type Brq Ar name ...
Force resolving of
.Ar name
and its subdomains by the given resolver
.Ar type .
The
.Ar type
must be listed in the
.Ic preference
list to be used.
If
.Cm accept bogus
is specified, validation is not enforced.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/unwind.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/unwind.conf
The default
.Xr unwind 8
configuration file.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Block requests for domains in
.Pa /etc/blocklist
and log each blocked request:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
block list "/etc/blocklist" log
.Ed
.Pp
Define a DNS over TLS (DoT) forwarder and make it the preferred resolver:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
forwarder { 192.168.1.250 port 8080 authentication name "resolver.local" DoT }
preference { DoT }
.Ed
.Pp
Where a domain requires a specific nameserver
and it may only exist in a nameserver available on the local network,
force
.Xr unwind 8
to use a specific resolver type:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
force autoconf { domain.local }
.Ed

The
.Nm
file format first appeared in
.Ox 6.5 .
