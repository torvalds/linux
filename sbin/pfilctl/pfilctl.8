.Xr pfil 9
packet filtering hooks and filters on them.

List available packet filters.

.Ar hook Ar head
.Xc

to

With the
.Fl i
flag the hook will be connected as input and with
.Fl o
as output hook.
At least one of
.Fl i
or
.Fl o
is required.
By default
.Nm
will prepend the hook in front of other hooks if any present:
new hook will be as close to the wire as possible, so that on input
it will be the first filter and on output it will be the last.
Adding the
.Fl a
flag switches to appending new hook instead of prepending.
