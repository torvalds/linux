utility zeroes out the inodes with the specified inode number(s)
on the file system residing on the given
.Ar special_device .
The
.Xr fsck 8
utility is usually run after

to reclaim the zeroed inode(s) and the
blocks previously claimed by those inode(s).
Both read and write permission are required on the specified
.Ar special_device .
.Pp
The primary purpose of this routine
is to remove a file which
for some reason is not being properly handled by
.Xr fsck 8 .
Once removed,
it is anticipated that
.Xr fsck 8
will be able to clean up the resulting mess.
