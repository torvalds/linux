.Sh NAME
.Nm clri
.Nd clear inodes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm clri
.Ar special_device inode_number ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
.Nm
is obsoleted for normal file system repair work by
.Xr fsck 8 .
.Ef
.Pp
.Nm
zeros out the inodes with the specified inode numbers
on the filesystem residing on the given
.Ar special_device .
The
.Xr fsck 8
utility is usually run after
.Nm
to reclaim the zero'ed inodes and the
blocks previously claimed by those inodes.
Both read and write permission are required on the specified
.Ar special_device .
.Pp
The primary purpose of this routine
is to remove a file which
for some reason is not being properly handled by
.Xr fsck 8 .
Once removed,
it is anticipated that
.Xr fsck 8
will be able to clean up the resulting mess.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr inode 5 ,
.Xr fsck 8 ,
.Xr fsdb 8 ,
.Xr ncheck 8
.Sh BUGS
If the file is open, the work of
.Nm
will be lost when the inode is written back to disk from the inode cache.
