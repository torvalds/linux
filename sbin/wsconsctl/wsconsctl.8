.Sh NAME
.Nm wsconsctl
.Nd get or set wscons state
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm wsconsctl
.Op Fl an
.Nm wsconsctl
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Ar name ...
.Nm wsconsctl
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command displays or sets various wscons system driver variables.
If a list of variables is present on the command line,
.Nm
prints the current value of those variables for the specified device.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Print all device variables and their current values.
This is the default, if no parameters are given to
.Nm .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative control device.
.It Fl n
Suppress printing of the variable name in the output.
.It Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
Attempt to set the specified variable
.Ar name
to
.Ar value .
The value can be specified as either an absolute, by using the
.Ql =
symbol,
or as a relative value, by using the
.Ql +=
or
.Ql -=
symbols.
See the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section for more details.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility can be used to view and modify aspects of the keyboard,
display, and mouse using the standard, machine-independent
workstation console device driver
.Xr wscons 4 .
.Pp
The keyboard type can be modified, the keyboard bell's pitch, period,
and duration can be modified,
the
.Ar typematic
value can be changed, and the keyboard encoding can be modified
to switch keys, should the user find a keyboard's default layout
difficult to use.
.Pp
There are also definitions relating to video
control and cursor control, which are not applicable to
all display types, and to text emulation and graphics
(mapped) modes.
.Pp
Use the
.Xr kbd 8
utility to determine which keyboard encodings are available for your
country.
.Pp
A keyboard mapping can also be specified in
.Pa /etc/kbdtype .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/include/dev/wscons/wsconsio.h -compact
.It Pa /dev/ttyC0
display control device
.It Pa /dev/wskbd0

.It Pa /dev/wsmouse0

.It Pa /etc/kbdtype
default keyboard mapping
.It Pa /etc/wsconsctl.conf
a list of parameters that get set at system startup time from
.Xr rc 8

.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Set a UK keyboard encoding:
.Pp
.Dl # wsconsctl keyboard.encoding=uk
.Pp
Modify the current keyboard encoding so that, when the
.Ar Caps Lock
key is pressed, the same encoding sequence as
.Ar Left Control
is sent.
For a full list of keysyms, and keycodes, refer
to the
.Ar /usr/include/dev/wscons/wsksymdef.h
file.
.Pp
.Dl # wsconsctl keyboard.map+="keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L"
.Pp
Assign the
.Ar Right Alt
key to be the group modifier (layout is changed while the key is pressed):
.Pp
.Dl # wsconsctl keyboard.map+="keycode 184=Mode_switch"
.Pp
Assign the
.Ar Right Control
key to be the lock for the group modifier.
The effect of
.Ar Mode_Lock
and
.Ar Mode_switch
is not mutually exclusive, to be consistent with
.Ar Caps Lock
and
.Ar Shift
behaviour.
.Pp
.Dl # wsconsctl keyboard.map+="keycode 157=Mode_Lock"
.Pp
Set a US keyboard encoding, with the
.Ar Caps Lock
and
.Ar Left Control
keys swapped.
The
.Ar .swapctrlcaps
encoding does not work for all national keyboard encodings.
For most purposes, the ability to set the value returned
by the
.Ar Caps Lock
key is enough \- see the previous example for details.
.Pp
.Dl # wsconsctl keyboard.encoding=us.swapctrlcaps
.Pp
Set the bell pitch to be 1200:
.Pp
.Dl # wsconsctl keyboard.bell.pitch=1200
.Pp
Add 200 to the current pitch of the bell:
.Pp
.Dl # wsconsctl keyboard.bell.pitch+=200
.Pp
Set the display font to Gallant:
.Pp
.Dl # wsconsctl display.font=Gallant
