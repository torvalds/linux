.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to control the behaviour of the
.Xr hastd 8
daemon.
.Pp
This utility should be used by HA software like
.Nm heartbeat
or
.Nm ucarp
to setup HAST resources role when changing from primary mode to
secondary or vice versa.
Be aware that if a file system like UFS exists on HAST provider and
primary node dies, file system has to be checked for inconsistencies
with the
.Xr fsck 8
utility after switching secondary node to primary role.
.Pp
The first argument to
.Nm
indicates an action to be performed:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm create"
.It Cm create
Initialize local provider configured for the given resource.
Additional options include:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl e Ar extentsize"
.It Fl e Ar extentsize
Size of an extent.
Extent is a block which is used for synchronization.
.Xr hastd 8
maintains a map of dirty extents and extent is the smallest region that
can be marked as dirty.
If any part of an extent is modified, entire extent will be synchronized
when nodes connect.
If extent size is too small, there will be too much disk activity
related to dirty map updates, which will degrade performance of the
given resource.
If extent size is too large, synchronization, even in case of short
outage, can take a long time increasing the risk of losing up-to-date
node before synchronization process is completed.
The default extent size is
.Va 2MB .
.It Fl k Ar keepdirty
Maximum number of dirty extents to keep dirty all the time.
Most recently used extents are kept dirty to reduce number of metadata
updates.
The default number of most recently used extents which will be kept
dirty is
.Va 64 .
.It Fl m Ar mediasize
Size of the smaller provider used as backend storage on both nodes.
This option can be omitted if node providers have the same size on both
sides.
.El
.Pp
If size is suffixed with a k, M, G or T, it is taken as a kilobyte,
megabyte, gigabyte or terabyte measurement respectively.
.It Cm role
Change role of the given resource.
The role can be one of:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm secondary"
.It Cm init
Resource is turned off.
.It Cm primary
Local
.Xr hastd 8
daemon will act as primary node for the given resource.
System on which resource role is set to primary can use
.Pa /dev/hast/<name>
GEOM provider.
.It Cm secondary
Local
.Xr hastd 8
daemon will act as secondary node for the given resource - it will wait
for connection from the primary node and will handle I/O requests
received from it.
GEOM provider
.Pa /dev/hast/<name>
will not be created on secondary node.
.El
.It Cm list
Present verbose status of the configured resources.
.It Cm status
Present terse (and more easy machine-parseable) status of the configured
resources.
.It Cm dump
Dump metadata stored on local component for the configured resources.
.El
.Pp
In addition, every subcommand can be followed by the following options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl c Ar config"
.It Fl c Ar config
Specify alternative location of the configuration file.
The default location is
.Pa /etc/hast.conf .
.It Fl d
Print debugging information.
This option can be specified multiple times to raise the verbosity
level.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /var/run/hastctl" -compact
.It Pa /etc/hast.conf
Configuration file for
.Nm
and
.Xr hastd 8 .
.It Pa /var/run/hastctl
Control socket used by
.Nm
to communicate with the
.Xr hastd 8
daemon.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
Exit status is 0 on success, or one of the values described in
.Xr sysexits 3
on failure.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Initialize HAST provider, create file system on it and mount it.
