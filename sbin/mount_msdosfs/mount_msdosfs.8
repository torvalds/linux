.Dt MOUNT_MSDOSFS 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_msdosfs
.Nd mount an MS-DOS file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 9ls
.Op Fl D Ar DOS_codepage
.Op Fl g Ar gid
.Op Fl L Ar locale
.Op Fl M Ar mask
.Op Fl m Ar mask
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl u Ar uid
.Op Fl W Ar table
.Ar special node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility attaches the MS-DOS file system residing on
the device
.Pa special
to the global file system namespace at the location
indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time, but can be used by any user to mount an
MS-DOS file system on any directory that they own (provided,
of course, that they have appropriate access to the device that
contains the file system).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar options
Use the specified mount
.Ar options ,
as described in
.Xr mount 8 .
The following MSDOS file system-specific options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm longnames
Force Windows 95 long filenames to be visible.
.It Cm shortnames
Force only the old MS-DOS 8.3 style filenames to be visible.
.It Cm nowin95
Completely ignore Windows 95 extended file information.
.El
.It Fl u Ar uid
Set the owner of the files in the file system to
.Ar uid .
The default owner is the owner of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl g Ar gid
Set the group of the files in the file system to
.Ar gid .
The default group is the group of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl m Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for files
in the file system.
(For example, a
.Ar mask
of
.Li 755
specifies that, by default, the owner should have
read, write, and execute permissions for files, but
others should only have read and execute permissions.
See
.Xr chmod 1
for more information about octal file modes.
Only the nine low-order bits of
.Ar mask
are used.
The value of
.Ar -M
is used if it is supplied and
.Ar -m
is omitted.
The default
.Ar mask
is taken from the
directory on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl M Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for directories
in the file system.
The value of
.Ar -m
is used if it is supplied and
.Ar -M
is omitted.
See the previous option's description for details.
.It Fl s
Force behaviour to
ignore and not generate Win'95 long filenames.
.It Fl l
Force listing and generation of
Win'95 long filenames
and separate creation/modification/access dates.
.Pp
If neither
.Fl s
nor
.Fl l
are given,
.Fl l
is the default.
.It Fl 9
Ignore the special Win'95 directory entries even
if deleting or renaming a file.
This forces
.Fl s .
.\".It Fl G
.\"This option causes the file system to be interpreted as an Atari-Gemdos
.\"file system.
.\"The differences to the MS-DOS file system are minimal and
.\"limited to the boot block.
.\"This option enforces
.\".Fl s .
.It Fl L Ar locale
Specify locale name used for file name conversions
for DOS and Win'95 names.
By default ISO 8859-1 assumed as local character set.
.It Fl D Ar DOS_codepage
Specify the MS-DOS code page (aka IBM/OEM code page) name used for
file name conversions for DOS names.
.It Fl W Ar table
.Bf Em
This option is preserved for backward compatibility purpose only,
and will be removed in the future.
Please avoid using this option.
.Ef
.Pp
Specify text file name with conversion table:
.Pa iso22dos , iso72dos , koi2dos , koi8u2dos .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To mount a Russian MS-DOS file system located in
.Pa /dev/ada1s1 :
.Pp
.Dl "mount_msdosfs -L ru_RU.KOI8-R -D CP866 /dev/ada1s1 /mnt"
.Pp
To mount a Japanese MS-DOS file system located in
.Pa /dev/ada1s1 :
.Pp
.Dl "mount_msdosfs -L ja_JP.eucJP -D CP932 /dev/ada1s1 /mnt"

.Sh HISTORY
The predecessor to
.Nm mount_msdos
utility named
.Nm mount_pcfs
appeared in
.Nx 0.8 .
It was rewritten in
.Nx 1.0
and first appeared in
.Fx 2.0 .
.Nm mount_msdos
was renamed to the more aptly-named
.Nm
in
.Fx 5.0.
The character code conversion routine was added in 2003.
.Sh AUTHORS
Initial implementation as
.Nm mount_pcfs
was written by
.An -nosplit
.An Paul Popelka Aq Mt paulp@uts.amdahl.com .
It was rewritten by
.An Christopher G. Demetriou Aq Mt cgd@NetBSD.org .
The character code conversion routine was added by
.An Ryuichiro Imura Aq Mt imura@ryu16.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
The use of the
.Fl 9
flag could result in damaged file systems,
albeit the damage is in part taken care of by
procedures similar to the ones used in Win'95.
