.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_ffs
.Nd mount a Berkeley Fast File System
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_ffs
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Ar special node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches the Berkeley Fast File System on the
.Ar special
device on to the file system tree at point
.Ar node .
.Pp
This command is invoked by
.Xr mount 8
when using any of the following syntax:
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Nm mount Op options
.Ar special node
.br
.Nm mount Op options
-t ffs
.Ar special node
.br
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ar special
device is either a
.Xr disklabel 8
UID (DUID) or an entry in
.Pa /dev .
If it is a DUID,
it will be automatically mapped to the appropriate entry in
.Pa /dev .
In either case the partition must be present
in the disklabel loaded from the device.
The partition name is the last letter in the entry name.
For example, /dev/sd0a and 3eb7f9da875cb9ee.a both refer to the
.Sq a
partition.
.Pp
This command is normally executed per file system by
.Xr rc 8
at boot time using the
.Xr mount 8
command.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar options
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the
.Xr mount 8
man page for possible options and their meanings.
