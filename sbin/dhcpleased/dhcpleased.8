.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcpleased
.Nd Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dnv
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl s Ar socket
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) daemon for clients.
If an interface has the
.Sy AUTOCONF4
flag set
(auto configuration is enabled),
.Nm
sends requests for IP configuration information from a DHCP server,
such as
.Xr dhcpd 8 ,
and uses that information to configure the relevant interface.
.Pp
See
.Xr hostname.if 5
and
.Xr ifconfig 8
on how to enable auto configuration on an interface.
.Pp
.Nm
monitors network interface states (interface going up or down,
auto configuration enabled or disabled, etc.) and sends requests
when necessary.
A running
.Nm
can be controlled with the
.Xr dhcpleasectl 8
utility.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl s Ar socket
Use an alternate location for the default control socket.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
Multiple
.Fl v
options increase the verbosity.
