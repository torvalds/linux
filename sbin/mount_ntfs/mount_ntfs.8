.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_ntfs
.Op Fl ai
.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl m Ar mask
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Ar special
.Ar node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches the NTFS filesystem residing on the device
.Ar special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location
indicated by
.Ar node .
This command is invoked by
.Xr mount 8
when using the syntax
.Bd -ragged -offset 4h
.Nm mount Op options
-t ntfs
.Ar special node
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ar special
device is either a
.Xr disklabel 8
UID (DUID) or an entry in
.Pa /dev .
If it is a DUID,
it will be automatically mapped to the appropriate entry in
.Pa /dev .
In either case the partition must be present
in the disklabel loaded from the device.
The partition name is the last letter in the entry name.
For example, /dev/sd0a and 3eb7f9da875cb9ee.a both refer to the
.Sq a
partition.
.Pp
The supported NTFS versions include both NTFS4, as used by Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0, and NTFS5, as used by Microsoft Windows 2000 and XP.
Only read-only operation is permitted, which is automatically enforced.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Force behaviour to return MS-DOS 8.3 names also on
.Fn readdir .
.It Fl g Ar group
Specifies the group name or GID of the root inode of the file system.
Defaults to the mount point's GID.
.It Fl i
Make name lookup case insensitive for all names except POSIX names.
.It Fl m Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for files
in the file system.
.It Fl o Ar options
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the
.Xr mount 8
man page for possible options and their meanings.
.It Fl u Ar user
Specifies the user name or UID of the root inode of the file system.
Defaults to the mount point's UID.

.Sh FEATURES
.Ss NTFS file attributes

is one of identifier listed in $AttrDef file of volume.
Default is $DATA.
.Sq ATTRNAME
is an attribute name.
Default is none.

.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cat /mnt/\e$Volume:\e$VOLUME_NAME

.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cat /mnt/foodir:\e$INDEX_ROOT:\e$I30
