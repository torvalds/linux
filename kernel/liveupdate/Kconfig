	help
	  Allow kexec to hand over state across kernels by generating and
	  passing additional metadata to the target kernel. This is useful
	  to keep data or state alive across the kexec. For this to work,
	  both source and target kernels need to have this option enabled.

config KEXEC_HANDOVER_DEBUG
	bool "Enable Kexec Handover debug checks"
	depends on KEXEC_HANDOVER
	help
	  This option enables extra sanity checks for the Kexec Handover
	  subsystem. Since, KHO performance is crucial in live update
	  scenarios and the extra code might be adding overhead it is
	  only optionally enabled.

config KEXEC_HANDOVER_DEBUGFS

	select DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Allow to control kexec handover device tree via debugfs
	  interface, i.e. finalize the state or aborting the finalization.
	  Also, enables inspecting the KHO fdt trees with the debugfs binary
	  blobs.

config KEXEC_HANDOVER_ENABLE_DEFAULT
	bool "Enable kexec handover by default"
	depends on KEXEC_HANDOVER
	help
	  Enable Kexec Handover by default. This avoids the need to
	  explicitly pass 'kho=on' on the kernel command line.

	  This is useful for systems where KHO is a prerequisite for other
	  features, such as Live Update, ensuring the mechanism is always
	  active.

	  The default behavior can still be overridden at boot time by
	  passing 'kho=off'.
