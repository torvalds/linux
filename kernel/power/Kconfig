	  Enable the suspend to disk (STD) functionality, which is usually
	  called "hibernation" in user interfaces.  STD checkpoints the
	  system and powers it off; and restores that checkpoint on reboot.

	  You can suspend your machine with 'echo disk > /sys/power/state'
	  after placing resume=/dev/swappartition on the kernel command line
	  in your bootloader's configuration file.

	  Alternatively, you can use the additional userland tools available
	  from <http://suspend.sf.net>.

	  In principle it does not require ACPI or APM, although for example
	  ACPI will be used for the final steps when it is available.  One
	  of the reasons to use software suspend is that the firmware hooks
	  for suspend states like suspend-to-RAM (STR) often don't work very
	  well with Linux.

	  It creates an image which is saved in your active swap. Upon the next
	  boot, pass the 'resume=/dev/swappartition' argument to the kernel to
	  have it detect the saved image, restore memory state from it, and
	  continue to run as before. If you do not want the previous state to
	  be reloaded, then use the 'noresume' kernel command line argument.
	  Note, however, that fsck will be run on your filesystems and you will
	  need to run mkswap against the swap partition used for the suspend.

	  It also works with swap files to a limited extent (for details see
	  <file:Documentation/power/swsusp-and-swap-files.rst>).

	  Right now you may boot without resuming and resume later but in the
	  meantime you cannot use the swap partition(s)/file(s) involved in
	  suspending.  Also in this case you must not use the filesystems
	  that were mounted before the suspend.  In particular, you MUST NOT
	  MOUNT any journaled filesystems mounted before the suspend or they
	  will get corrupted in a nasty way.

	  For more information take a look at <file:Documentation/power/swsusp.rst>.

	  The default resume partition is the partition that the suspend-

	  The partition specified here will be different for almost every user.
	  It should be a valid swap partition (at least for now) that is turned
	  on before suspending.

	  The partition specified can be overridden by specifying:

		resume=/dev/<other device>

	  which will set the resume partition to the device specified.

	  Note there is currently not a way to specify which device to save the
	  suspended image to. It will simply pick the first available swap

config PM_USERSPACE_AUTOSLEEP

	Notify kernel of aggressive userspace autosleep power management policy.

	This option changes the behavior of various sleep-sensitive code to deal
	with frequent userspace-initiated transitions into a global sleep state.

	Saying Y here, disables code paths that most users really should keep
	enabled. In particular, only enable this if it is very common to be
	asleep/awake for very short periods of time (<= 2 seconds).

	Only platforms, such as Android, that implement opportunistic sleep from
	a userspace power manager service should enable this option; and not
	other machines. Therefore, you should say N here, unless you are
	extremely certain that this is what you want. The option otherwise has
	bad, undesirable effects, and should not be enabled just for fun.

	  Hardware support is generally required for this functionality to work

	This enables some cheesy code to save the last PM event point in the

	To use this debugging feature you should attempt to suspend the

config APM_EMULATION

	  APM is a BIOS specification for saving power using several different
	  techniques. This is mostly useful for battery powered laptops with
	  APM compliant BIOSes. If you say Y here, the system time will be
	  reset after a RESUME operation, the /proc/apm device will provide
	  battery status information, and user-space programs will receive
	  notification of APM "events" (e.g. battery status change).

	  In order to use APM, you will need supporting software. For location
	  and more information, read <file:Documentation/power/apm-acpi.rst>
	  and the Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver does not spin down disk drives (see the hdparm(8)
	  manpage ("man 8 hdparm") for that), and it doesn't turn off
	  VESA-compliant "green" monitors.

	  Generally, if you don't have a battery in your machine, there isn't
	  much point in using this driver and you should say N. If you get
	  random kernel OOPSes or reboots that don't seem to be related to
	  anything, try disabling/enabling this option (or disabling/enabling
	  APM in your BIOS).

	  Per-cpu workqueues are generally preferred because they show

	  Enabling workqueue.power_efficient kernel parameter makes the
	  per-cpu workqueues which were observed to contribute
	  significantly to power consumption unbound, leading to measurably
	  lower power usage at the cost of small performance overhead.
