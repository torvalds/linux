config CMA_ALIGNMENT

	help
	  DMA mapping framework by default aligns all buffers to the smallest
	  PAGE_SIZE order which is greater than or equal to the requested buffer
	  size. This works well for buffers up to a few hundreds kilobytes, but
	  for larger buffers it just a memory waste. With this parameter you can
	  specify the maximum PAGE_SIZE order for contiguous buffers. Larger
	  buffers will be aligned only to this specified order. The order is
	  expressed as a power of two multiplied by the PAGE_SIZE.

	  For example, if your system defaults to 4KiB pages, the order value
	  of 8 means that the buffers will be aligned up to 1MiB only.

	  If unsure, leave the default value "8".

	  drivers like double-freeing of DMA mappings or freeing mappings that

	  This option causes a performance degradation.  Use only if you want to

	help
	  Perform extra checking that callers of dma_map_sg() have respected the
	  appropriate segment length/boundary limits for the given device when
	  preparing DMA scatterlists.

	  This is particularly likely to have been overlooked in cases where the
	  dma_map_sg() API is used for general bulk mapping of pages rather than
	  preparing literal scatter-gather descriptors, where there is a risk of
	  unexpected behaviour from DMA API implementations if the scatterlist
	  is technically out-of-spec.

	  If unsure, say N.
