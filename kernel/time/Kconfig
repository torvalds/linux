config HZ_PERIODIC
	bool "Periodic timer ticks (constant rate, no dynticks)"
	help
	  This option keeps the tick running periodically at a constant
	  rate, even when the CPU doesn't need it.

config NO_HZ_IDLE
	bool "Idle dynticks system (tickless idle)"
	depends on !ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET && GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS
	select NO_HZ_COMMON
	help
	  This option enables a tickless idle system: timer interrupts
	  will only trigger on an as-needed basis when the system is idle.
	  This is usually interesting for energy saving.

	  Most of the time you want to say Y here.

	 Adaptively try to shutdown the tick whenever possible, even when
	 the CPU is running tasks. Typically this requires running a single
	 task on the CPU. Chances for running tickless are maximized when
	 the task mostly runs in userspace and has few kernel activity.

	 You need to fill up the nohz_full boot parameter with the
	 desired range of dynticks CPUs.

	 This is implemented at the expense of some overhead in user <-> kernel
	 transitions: syscalls, exceptions and interrupts. Even when it's
	 dynamically off.

	 Say N.

config CONTEXT_TRACKING

config CONTEXT_TRACKING_FORCE
	bool "Force context tracking"
	depends on CONTEXT_TRACKING
	default y if !NO_HZ_FULL
	help
	  The major pre-requirement for full dynticks to work is to
	  support the context tracking subsystem. But there are also
	  other dependencies to provide in order to make the full
	  dynticks working.

	  This option stands for testing when an arch implements the
	  context tracking backend but doesn't yet fullfill all the
	  requirements to make the full dynticks feature working.
	  Without the full dynticks, there is no way to test the support
	  for context tracking and the subsystems that rely on it: RCU
	  userspace extended quiescent state and tickless cputime
	  accounting. This option copes with the absence of the full
	  dynticks subsystem by forcing the context tracking on all
	  CPUs in the system.

	  Say Y only if you're working on the development of an
	  architecture backend for the context tracking.

	  Say N otherwise, this option brings an overhead that you
	  don't want in production.

config NO_HZ
	bool "Old Idle dynticks config"
	depends on !ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET && GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS
	help
	  This is the old config entry that enables dynticks idle.
	  We keep it around for a little while to enforce backward
	  compatibility with older config files.

config HIGH_RES_TIMERS
	bool "High Resolution Timer Support"
	depends on !ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET && GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS
	select TICK_ONESHOT
	help
	  This option enables high resolution timer support. If your
	  hardware is not capable then this option only increases
	  the size of the kernel image.
