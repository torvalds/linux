	  This option keeps the tick running periodically at a constant
	  rate, even when the CPU doesn't need it.

config NO_HZ_IDLE

	help
	  This option enables a tickless idle system: timer interrupts
	  will only trigger on an as-needed basis when the system is idle.
	  This is usually interesting for energy saving.

	  Most of the time you want to say Y here.

	help
	 Adaptively try to shutdown the tick whenever possible, even when
	 the CPU is running tasks. Typically this requires running a single
	 task on the CPU. Chances for running tickless are maximized when
	 the task mostly runs in userspace and has few kernel activity.

	 You need to fill up the nohz_full boot parameter with the
	 desired range of dynticks CPUs.

	 This is implemented at the expense of some overhead in user <-> kernel
	 transitions: syscalls, exceptions and interrupts. Even when it's
	 dynamically off.

	 Say N.

       help
         If the user doesn't pass the nohz_full boot option to
	 define the range of full dynticks CPUs, consider that all
	 CPUs in the system are full dynticks by default.
	 Note the boot CPU will still be kept outside the range to
	 handle the timekeeping duty.

	help
	  This is the old config entry that enables dynticks idle.
	  We keep it around for a little while to enforce backward
	  compatibility with older config files.

	  This option enables high resolution timer support. If your
	  hardware is not capable then this option only increases
	  the size of the kernel image.
