menuconfig RV
	bool "Runtime Verification"
	depends on TRACING
	help
	  Enable the kernel runtime verification infrastructure. RV is a
	  lightweight (yet rigorous) method that complements classical
	  exhaustive verification techniques (such as model checking and
	  theorem proving). RV works by analyzing the trace of the system's
	  actual execution, comparing it against a formal specification of
	  the system behavior.

	  For further information, see:

config RV_REACTORS
	bool "Runtime verification reactors"
	default y
	depends on RV
	help
	  Enables the online runtime verification reactors. A runtime
	  monitor can cause a reaction to the detection of an exception
	  on the model's execution. By default, the monitors have
	  tracing reactions, printing the monitor output via tracepoints,
	  but other reactions can be added (on-demand) via this interface.

config RV_REACT_PRINTK
	bool "Printk reactor"
	depends on RV_REACTORS
	default y
	help
	  Enables the printk reactor. The printk reactor emits a printk()
	  message if an exception is found.

config RV_REACT_PANIC
	bool "Panic reactor"
	depends on RV_REACTORS
	default y
	help
	  Enables the panic reactor. The panic reactor emits a printk()
	  message if an exception is found and panic()s the system.
