	help
	  Enable the kernel to trace every kernel function. This is done
	  by using a compiler feature to insert a small, 5-byte No-Operation
	  instruction at the beginning of every kernel function, which NOP
	  sequence is then dynamically patched into a tracer call when

	  Enable the kernel to trace a function at both its return
	  and its entry.
	  Its first purpose is to trace the duration of functions and
	  draw a call graph for each thread with some information like

config TRACER_SNAPSHOT

config TRACER_SNAPSHOT_PER_CPU_SWAP

	  allowed:

	      echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/per_cpu/cpu2/snapshot

	  After which, only the tracing buffer for CPU 2 was swapped with
	  the main tracing buffer, and the other CPU buffers remain the same.

	  When this is enabled, this adds a little more overhead to the
	  trace recording, as it needs to add some checks to synchronize
	  recording with swaps. But this does not affect the performance
	  of the overall system. This is enabled by default when the preempt
	  or irq latency tracers are enabled, as those need to swap as well
	  and already adds the overhead (plus a lot more).

choice
	prompt "Branch Profiling"
	default BRANCH_PROFILE_NONE
	help
	 The branch profiling is a software profiler. It will add hooks
	 into the C conditionals to test which path a branch takes.

	 The likely/unlikely profiler only looks at the conditions that
	 are annotated with a likely or unlikely macro.

	 The "all branch" profiler will profile every if-statement in the
	 kernel. This profiler will also enable the likely/unlikely
	 profiler.

	 Either of the above profilers adds a bit of overhead to the system.
	 If unsure, choose "No branch profiling".

config BRANCH_PROFILE_NONE
	bool "No branch profiling"
	help
	  No branch profiling. Branch profiling adds a bit of overhead.
	  Only enable it if you want to analyse the branching behavior.
	  Otherwise keep it disabled.

config PROFILE_ANNOTATED_BRANCHES
	bool "Trace likely/unlikely profiler"
	select TRACE_BRANCH_PROFILING
	help
	  This tracer profiles all likely and unlikely macros
	  in the kernel. It will display the results in:

	  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_stat/branch_annotated

	  Note: this will add a significant overhead; only turn this
	  on if you need to profile the system's use of these macros.

config PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES
	bool "Profile all if conditionals"
	select TRACE_BRANCH_PROFILING
	help
	  This tracer profiles all branch conditions. Every if ()
	  taken in the kernel is recorded whether it hit or miss.
	  The results will be displayed in:

	  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_stat/branch_all

	  This option also enables the likely/unlikely profiler.

	  This configuration, when enabled, will impose a great overhead
	  on the system. This should only be enabled when the system
	  is to be analyzed in much detail.

config TRACING_BRANCHES
	bool
	help
	  Selected by tracers that will trace the likely and unlikely
	  conditions. This prevents the tracers themselves from being

config BRANCH_TRACER
	bool "Trace likely/unlikely instances"
	depends on TRACE_BRANCH_PROFILING
	select TRACING_BRANCHES
	help
	  This traces the events of likely and unlikely condition
	  calls in the kernel.  The difference between this and the
	  "Trace likely/unlikely profiler" is that this is not a
	  histogram of the callers, but actually places the calling
	  events into a running trace buffer to see when and where the
	  events happened, as well as their results.

	  Say N if unsure.

config STACK_TRACER
	bool "Trace max stack"
	depends on HAVE_FUNCTION_TRACER
	select FUNCTION_TRACER
	select STACKTRACE
	select KALLSYMS
	help
	  This special tracer records the maximum stack footprint of the
	  kernel and displays it in /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/stack_trace.

	  This tracer works by hooking into every function call that the
	  kernel executes, and keeping a maximum stack depth value and
	  stack-trace saved.  If this is configured with DYNAMIC_FTRACE
	  then it will not have any overhead while the stack tracer
	  is disabled.

	  To enable the stack tracer on bootup, pass in 'stacktrace'
	  on the kernel command line.

	  The stack tracer can also be enabled or disabled via the
	  sysctl kernel.stack_tracer_enabled

	  Say N if unsure.

	  Say Y here if you want to be able to trace the block layer actions

	  on a block device queue. For more information (and the userspace
	  support tools needed), fetch the blktrace tools from:

	  git://git.kernel.dk/blktrace.git

	  Tracing also is possible using the ftrace interface, e.g.:

	    echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/sda1/trace/enable
	    echo blk > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
	    cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe

	  This allows the user to add tracing events (similar to tracepoints)
	  on the fly via the ftrace interface. See
	  Documentation/trace/kprobetrace.txt for more details.

	  Those events can be inserted wherever kprobes can probe, and record
	  various register and memory values.

	  This option is also required by perf-probe subcommand of perf tools.
	  If you want to use perf tools, this option is strongly recommended.

	  This allows the user to add tracing events on top of userspace
	  dynamic events (similar to tracepoints) on the fly via the trace
	  events interface. Those events can be inserted wherever uprobes
	  can probe, and record various registers.

config DYNAMIC_FTRACE

	default y
	help
	  This option will modify all the calls to function tracing
	  dynamically (will patch them out of the binary image and
	  replace them with a No-Op instruction) on boot up. During
	  compile time, a table is made of all the locations that ftrace
	  can function trace, and this table is linked into the kernel
	  image. When this is enabled, functions can be individually
	  enabled, and the functions not enabled will not affect
	  performance of the system.

	  See the files in /sys/kernel/debug/tracing:
	    available_filter_functions
	    set_ftrace_filter
	    set_ftrace_notrace

	  This way a CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER kernel is slightly larger, but
	  otherwise has native performance as long as no tracing is active.

config FUNCTION_PROFILER

	  This option enables the kernel function profiler. A file is created

	  When a 1 is echoed into this file profiling begins, and when a

config EVENT_TRACE_TEST_SYSCALLS
	bool "Run selftest on syscall events"
	depends on FTRACE_STARTUP_TEST
	help
	 This option will also enable testing every syscall event.
	 It only enables the event and disables it and runs various loads

	  This is a dumb module for testing mmiotrace. It is very dangerous

	  Say N, unless you absolutely know what you are doing.

config RING_BUFFER_BENCHMARK
	tristate "Ring buffer benchmark stress tester"
	depends on RING_BUFFER
	help
	  This option creates a test to stress the ring buffer and benchmark it.
	  It creates its own ring buffer such that it will not interfere with
	  any other users of the ring buffer (such as ftrace). It then creates
	  a producer and consumer that will run for 10 seconds and sleep for
	  10 seconds. Each interval it will print out the number of events
	  it recorded and give a rough estimate of how long each iteration took.

	  It does not disable interrupts or raise its priority, so it may be
	  affected by processes that are running.

	  If unsure, say N.

       bool "Ring buffer startup self test"
       depends on RING_BUFFER
       help
         Run a simple self test on the ring buffer on boot up. Late in the
	 kernel boot sequence, the test will start that kicks off
	 a thread per cpu. Each thread will write various size events
	 into the ring buffer. Another thread is created to send IPIs
	 to each of the threads, where the IPI handler will also write
	 to the ring buffer, to test/stress the nesting ability.
	 If any anomalies are discovered, a warning will be displayed
	 and all ring buffers will be disabled.

	 The test runs for 10 seconds. This will slow your boot time
	 by at least 10 more seconds.

	 At the end of the test, statics and more checks are done.
	 It will output the stats of each per cpu buffer. What
	 was written, the sizes, what was read, what was lost, and
	 other similar details.
