.Sh DESCRIPTION
These utilities take as input a message of arbitrary length and produce
as output a message digest (checksum) of the input.
.Pp
Two messages having the same message digest (a collision) have been produced
for MD5 and for SHA-1, so their use is deprecated.
.Pp
The options for use with each command are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Output checksums in base64 notation, not hexadecimal.
.It Fl C Ar checklist
Compare the checksum of each
.Ar file
against the checksums in the
.Ar checklist .
Any specified
.Ar file
that is not listed in the
.Ar checklist
will generate an error.
.It Fl c
If this option is specified, the
.Ar file
options become checklists.
Each checklist should contain hash results, which will be verified
against the specified paths.
Both normal (BSD) and reverse (GNU) forms are supported in either
hexadecimal or base64 format.
Output consists of the digest used, the file name,
and an OK, FAILED, or MISSING for the result of the comparison.
Entries in normal format can be validated using any of the supported checksums
(see
.Xr cksum 1 ) .
Entries in reverse format are validated using the default algorithm.
If no file is given, stdin is used.
.It Fl h Ar hashfile
Place the checksum into
.Ar hashfile
instead of stdout.
.It Fl p
Echo stdin to stdout and append the
checksum to stdout.
.It Fl q
Only print the checksum (quiet mode) or if used in conjunction with the
.Fl c
flag, only print the failed cases.
.It Fl r
Reverse the format of the hash algorithm output, similar to
the output format used by
.Xr cksum 1
(but without the number of octets).
This is also the format used by the GNU
.Xr cksum 1
utility.
.It Fl s Ar string
Print a checksum of the given
.Ar string .
.It Fl t
Run a built-in time trial.
Specifying
.Fl t
multiple times results in the number of rounds being multiplied
by 10 for each additional flag.
.It Fl x
Run a built-in test script.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
These utilities exit 0 on success,
and \*(Gt0 if an error occurs.
