.Sh NAME
.Nm mkdir
.Nd make directories
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mkdir
.Op Fl p
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Ar directory ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates the directories named as operands, in the order specified,
using mode
.Li rwxrwxrwx (\&0777)
as modified by the current
.Xr umask 2 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl m Ar mode
Set the file permission bits of the newly created directory to
.Ar mode .
The mode argument can be in any of the formats specified to the
.Xr chmod 1
utility.
If a symbolic mode is specified, the operators
.Ql +
and
.Ql -
are interpreted relative to an initial mode of
.Dq a=rwx .
.It Fl p
Create intermediate directories as required.
If this option is not specified, the full path prefix of each
operand must already exist.
Intermediate directories are created with permission bits of
.Li rwxrwxrwx (\&0777)
as modified by the current umask, plus write and search
permission for the owner.
Do not consider it an error if the
argument directory already exists.
.El
.Pp
The user must have write permission in the parent directory.
For an explanation of the directory hierarchy,
see
.Xr hier 7 .
