Last updated Jul '99 for pdksh-5.2.14.

PDksh is a mostly complete AT&T ksh look-alike (see NOTES file for a list
of things not supported).  Work is mostly finished to make it fully
compatible with both POSIX and AT&T ksh (when the two don't conflict).

PDksh was being maintained by Michael Rendell (michael@cs.mun.ca),
who took over from Simon J. Gerraty (sjg@zen.void.oz.au) at the latter's
suggestion.

Files of interest:
	CONTRIBUTORS	short history of pdksh, people who contributed, etc.
	NOTES		lists of known bugs in pdksh, at&t ksh, and posix.
	PROJECTS	list of things that need to be done in pdksh.
	LEGAL		A file detailing legal issues concerning pdksh.


BTW, THE MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED BUG IS
	echo hi | read a; echo $a	# Does not print hi
I'm aware of this and there is no need to report it.
