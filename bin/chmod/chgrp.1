.Sh NAME
.Nm chgrp
.Nd change group
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm chgrp
.Op Fl h
.Oo
.Fl R
.Op Fl H | L | P
.Oc
.Ar group
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sets the group ID of the specified files.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl H
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed.
Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.
.It Fl h
Treat symbolic links like other files: modify links instead of
following them.
The
.Fl h
and
.Fl R
options are mutually exclusive.
.It Fl L
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl R
Recurse.
Where
.Ar file
is a directory,
change the group ID of the directory and all the files and directories
in the file hierarchy below it.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L ,
and
.Fl P
options are ignored unless the
.Fl R
option is specified;
if none of them are given,
the default is to not follow symbolic links.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command's actions are determined by the last one specified.
.Pp
The
.Ar group
operand can be either a group name from the group database,
or a numeric group ID.
If a group name is also a numeric group ID, the operand is used as a
group name.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
clears the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on the file
to prevent accidental or mischievous creation of
set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.
.Pp
The user invoking
.Nm
must belong to the specified group and be the owner of the file,
or be the superuser.
