.Dt CHFLAGS 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm chflags
.Nd change file flags
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm chflags
.Op Fl h
.Oo
.Fl R
.Op Fl H | L | P
.Oc
.Ar flags
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility modifies the file flags of the listed files
as specified by the
.Ar flags
operand.
The
.Ar flags
of a file dictate special restrictions beyond those enforced by its
mode/permissions.
Only the superuser can change the user flags on block and
character devices.
.Pp
You can use
.Sy ls Fl lo
to see the flags of existing files.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl H
If the
.Fl R
option is also specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed.
Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.
.It Fl h
Treat symbolic links like other files: modify links instead of
following them.
The
.Fl h
and
.Fl R
options are mutually exclusive.
.It Fl L
If the
.Fl R
option is also specified, all symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
If the
.Fl R
option is also specified, no symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl R
Recurse.
Where
.Ar file
is a directory,
change the flags of the directory and all the files and directories
in the file hierarchy below it.
.El
.Pp
Flags are a comma separated list of keywords.
The following keywords are currently defined:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "nodump" -compact -offset indent
.It Cm arch
set the archived flag (superuser only)
.It Cm nodump
set the nodump flag (owner or superuser only)
.It Cm sappnd
set the system append-only flag (superuser only)
.It Cm schg
set the system immutable flag (superuser only)
.It Cm uappnd
set the user append-only flag (owner or superuser only)
.It Cm uchg
set the user immutable flag (owner or superuser only)
.El
.Pp
The
.Cm arch
flag is for compatibility only,
and currently has no effect.
.Pp
A file with the
.Cm nodump
flag set will by default only be backed up by
.Xr dump 8
during full backups.
The
.Fl h
option of
.Xr dump 8
can be used to alter this.
.Pp
An immutable file may not be changed, moved, or deleted.
An append-only file is immutable except that data may be appended to it.
.Pp
The
superuser-settable
.Cm sappnd
and
.Cm schg
flags can be set at any time, but may only be cleared when the system is
running at security level 0 or \-1
(insecure or permanently insecure mode, respectively).
For more information on setting the system security level,
see
.Xr securelevel 7 .
.Pp
Putting the letters
.Cm no
before a flag name causes the flag to be turned off.
For example:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "nouchg" -compact -offset indent
.It Cm nouchg
the immutable bit should be cleared
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L ,
and
.Fl P
options are ignored unless the
.Fl R
option is specified.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command's actions are determined by the last one specified.
