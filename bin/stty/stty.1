.Sh NAME
.Nm stty
.Nd set the options for a terminal device interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm stty
.Op Fl a | e | g
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Ar operands
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sets or reports on terminal
characteristics for the device that is its standard input.
If no options or operands are specified, it reports the settings of a subset
of characteristics as well as additional ones if they differ from their
default values.
Otherwise it modifies
the terminal state according to the specified arguments.
Some combinations of arguments are mutually
exclusive on some terminal types.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard output.
.It Fl e
Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard output
in the traditional
.Bx
.Dq all
and
.Dq everything
formats.
.It Fl f Ar file
Open and use the terminal named by
.Ar file
rather than using standard input.
The file is opened using the
.Dv O_NONBLOCK
flag of
.Xr open 2 ,
making it possible to
set or display settings on a terminal that might otherwise
block on the open.
.It Fl g
Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard output
in a form that may be used as an argument to a subsequent invocation of
.Nm
to restore the current terminal state.
The output does not contain any characters that require quoting,
to avoid word expansion by the shell.
.El
.Pp
The following arguments are available to set the terminal
characteristics:
.Ss Control modes
Control mode flags affect hardware characteristics associated with the
terminal.
This corresponds to the
.Li c_cflag
in the termios structure.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm parenb Pq Fl parenb
Enable (disable) parity generation
and detection.
.It Cm parodd Pq Fl parodd
Select odd (even) parity.
.It Cm cs5 cs6 cs7 cs8
Select character size, if possible.
.It Ar number
Set terminal baud rate to the
number given, if possible.
If the
baud rate is set to zero, modem
control is no longer
asserted.
.It Cm ispeed Ar number
Set terminal input baud rate to the
number given, if possible.
If the
input baud rate is set to zero, the
input baud rate is set to the
value of the output baud
rate.
.It Cm ospeed Ar number
Set terminal output baud rate to
the number given, if possible.
If
the output baud rate is set to
zero, modem control is
no longer asserted.
.It Cm speed Ar number
This sets both
.Cm ispeed
and
.Cm ospeed
to
.Ar number .
.It Cm hupcl Pq Fl hupcl
Stop asserting modem control
(do not stop asserting modem control) on last close.
.It Cm hup Pq Fl hup
Same as
.Cm hupcl
.Pq Fl hupcl .
.It Cm cstopb Pq Fl cstopb
Use two (one) stop bits per character.
.It Cm cread Pq Fl cread
Enable (disable) the receiver.
.It Cm clocal Pq Fl clocal
Assume a line without (with) modem
control.
.It Cm crtscts Pq Fl crtscts
Enable (disable) RTS/CTS flow control.
.El
.Ss Input modes
This corresponds to the
.Li c_iflag
in the termios structure.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm ignbrk Pq Fl ignbrk
Ignore (do not ignore) break on
input.
.It Cm brkint Pq Fl brkint
Signal (do not signal)
.Dv INTR
on
break.
.It Cm ignpar Pq Fl ignpar
Ignore (do not ignore) parity
errors.
.It Cm parmrk Pq Fl parmrk
Mark (do not mark) parity errors.
.It Cm inpck Pq Fl inpck
Enable (disable) input parity
checking.
.It Cm istrip Pq Fl istrip
Strip (do not strip) input characters
to seven bits.
.It Cm inlcr Pq Fl inlcr
Map (do not map)
.Dv NL
to
.Dv CR
on input.

Ignore (do not ignore)
.Dv CR
on input.
.It Cm icrnl Pq Fl icrnl
Map (do not map)
.Dv CR

.It Cm iuclc Pq Fl iuclc
Translate (do not translate) upper case to lower case
on input.
.It Cm ixon Pq Fl ixon
Enable (disable)
.Dv START/STOP
output
control.
Output from the system is
stopped when the system receives
.Dv STOP
and started when the system
receives
.Dv START ,
or if
.Cm ixany
is set, any character restarts output.
.It Cm ixoff Pq Fl ixoff
Request that the system send (not
send)
.Dv START/STOP
characters when
the input queue is nearly
empty/full.
.It Cm ixany Pq Fl ixany
Allow any character (allow only
.Dv START )
to restart output.
.It Cm imaxbel Pq Fl imaxbel
The system imposes a limit of
.Dv MAX_INPUT
(currently 255) characters in the input queue.
If
.Cm imaxbel
is set and the input queue limit has been reached,
subsequent input causes the system to send an ASCII BEL
character to the output queue (the terminal beeps at you).
Otherwise, if
.Cm imaxbel
is unset and the input queue is full, the next input character causes
the entire input and output queues to be discarded.
.El
.Ss Output modes
This corresponds to the
.Li c_oflag
of the termios structure.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm opost Pq Fl opost
Post-process output (do not
post-process output; ignore all other

.It Cm oxtabs Pq Fl oxtabs
Expand (do not expand) tabs to spaces on output.
.It Cm onoeot Pq Fl onoeot
Discard (do not discard) EOFs on output.
.El
.Ss Local modes
Local mode flags (lflags) affect various and sundry characteristics of terminal
processing.
Historically the term "local" pertained to new job control features
implemented by Jim Kulp on a PDP 11/70 at IIASA.
Later the driver ran on the first VAX at Evans Hall, UC Berkeley,
where the job control details were greatly modified
but the structure definitions and names remained essentially unchanged.
The second interpretation of the
.Sq l
in lflag is
.Dq line discipline flag
which corresponds to the
.Li c_lflag
of the termios structure.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm isig Pq Fl isig
Enable (disable) the checking of
characters against the special control
characters
.Dv INTR , QUIT ,
and
.Dv SUSP .
.It Cm icanon Pq Fl icanon
Enable (disable) canonical input
.Pf ( Dv ERASE
and
.Dv KILL
processing).

display, if possible.
.It Cm echonl Pq Fl echonl
Echo (do not echo)
.Dv NL ,
even if echo
is disabled.
.It Cm echoctl Pq Fl echoctl
If
.Cm echoctl
is set, echo control characters as
.Ql ^X .
Otherwise control characters echo as themselves.
.It Cm echoprt Pq Fl echoprt
For printing terminals.
If set, echo erased characters backwards within
.Ql \e
and
.Ql / .
Otherwise, disable this feature.
.It Cm noflsh Pq Fl noflsh
Disable (enable) flush after
.Dv INTR , QUIT , SUSP .
.It Cm tostop Pq Fl tostop
Send (do not send)
.Dv SIGTTOU
for background output.
This causes background jobs to stop if they attempt
terminal output.
.It Cm altwerase Pq Fl altwerase
Use (do not use) an alternate word erase algorithm when processing
.Dv WERASE
characters.
This alternate algorithm considers sequences of
alphanumeric/underscores as words.
It also skips the first preceding character in its classification
(as a convenience since the one preceding character could have been
erased with simply an
.Dv ERASE
character).
.It Cm mdmbuf Pq Fl mdmbuf

Indicates output is (is not) being discarded.
.It Cm pendin Pq Fl pendin
Indicates input is (is not) pending after a switch from non-canonical

with
.Cm iuclc
and
.Cm olcuc .
.El
.Ss Control characters
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ar control-character Ar string
Set
.Ar control-character
to
.Ar string .
If string is a single character,
the control character is set to
that character.
If string is the
two character sequence
.Ql ^-
or the string
.Dq undef ,
the control character
is disabled (i.e. set to
.Brq Dv _POSIX_VDISABLE ) .

Set the current terminal
characteristics to the saved settings
produced by the
.Fl g
option.

.Cm parodd .
.It Cm oddp
Enable
.Cm parenb ,
.Cm cs7 ,
and
.Cm parodd .
.It Fl parity , evenp , oddp
Disable
.Cm parenb
and set
.Cm cs8 .
.It Cm \&nl Pq Fl \&nl
Enable (disable)
.Cm icrnl .
In addition,

Reset
.Dv ERASE
and
.Dv KILL
characters
back to system defaults.
.It Cm sane
Resets all modes to reasonable values for interactive terminal use.
.It Cm tty
Set the line discipline to the standard terminal line discipline
.Dv TTYDISC .
.It Cm crt Pq Fl crt
Set (disable) all modes suitable for a CRT display device.
.It Cm kerninfo Pq Fl kerninfo
Enable (disable) the system generated status line associated with
processing a
.Dv STATUS
character (usually set to
.Ql ^T ) .
The status line consists of the
system load average, the current command name, its process ID, the
event the process is waiting on (or the status of the process), the user
and system times, percent CPU, and current memory usage.
.It Cm columns Ar number
The terminal size is recorded as having
.Ar number
columns.
.It Cm cols Ar number
This is an alias for
.Cm columns .
.It Cm rows Ar number
The terminal size is recorded as having
.Ar number
rows.
.It Cm dec
Set modes suitable for users of Digital Equipment Corporation systems
.Pf ( Dv ERASE ,
.Dv KILL ,
and
.Dv INTR
characters are set to ^?, ^U, and ^C;
.Dv ixany
is disabled, and
.Dv crt
is enabled).
.It Cm extproc Pq Fl extproc
If set, this flag indicates that some amount of terminal processing is being
performed by either the terminal hardware or by the remote side connected
to a pty.
.It Cm raw Pq Fl raw
If set, change the modes of the terminal so that no input or output processing
is performed.
If unset, change the modes of the terminal to some reasonable
state that performs input and output processing.
Note that since the terminal driver no longer has a single
.Dv RAW
bit, it is not possible to intuit what flags were set prior to setting
.Cm raw .
This means that unsetting
.Cm raw
may not put back all the setting that were previously in effect.
To set the terminal into a raw state and then accurately restore it,
the following shell code is recommended:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
save_state=$(stty -g)
stty raw
\&...
stty "$save_state"
.Ed
.It Cm size
The size of the terminal is printed as two numbers on a single line,
first rows, then columns.
