/*
 *	PAX - Portable Archive Interchange
 *
 *	A utility to read, write, and write lists of the members of archive
 *	files and copy directory hierarchies. A variety of archive formats
 *	are supported (some are described in POSIX 1003.1 10.1):
 *
 *		ustar - 10.1.1 extended tar interchange format
 *		cpio  - 10.1.2 extended cpio interchange format
 *		tar - old BSD 4.3 tar format
 *		binary cpio - old cpio with binary header format
 *		sysVR4 cpio -  with and without CRC
 *
 * This version is a superset of IEEE Std 1003.2b-d3
 *
 * Summary of Extensions to the IEEE Standard:
 *
 * 1	READ ENHANCEMENTS
 * 1.1	Operations which read archives will continue to operate even when
 *	processing archives which may be damaged, truncated, or fail to meet
 *	format specs in several different ways. Damaged sections of archives
 *	are detected and avoided if possible. Attempts will be made to resync
 *	archive read operations even with badly damaged media.
 * 1.2	Blocksize requirements are not strictly enforced on archive read.
 *	Tapes which have variable sized records can be read without errors.
 * 1.3	The user can specify via the non-standard option flag -E if error
 *	resync operation should stop on a media error, try a specified number
 *	of times to correct, or try to correct forever.
 * 1.4	Sparse files (lseek holes) stored on the archive (but stored with blocks
 *	of all zeros will be restored with holes appropriate for the target
 *	filesystem
 * 1.5	The user is notified whenever something is found during archive
 *	read operations which violates spec (but the read will continue).
 * 1.6	Multiple archive volumes can be read and may span over different
 *	archive devices
 * 1.7	Rigidly restores all file attributes exactly as they are stored on the
 *	archive.
 * 1.8	Modification change time ranges can be specified via multiple -T
 *	options. These allow a user to select files whose modification time
 *	lies within a specific time range.
 * 1.9	Files can be selected based on owner (user name or uid) via one or more
 *	-U options.
 * 1.10	Files can be selected based on group (group name or gid) via one o
 *	more -G options.
 * 1.11	File modification time can be checked against existing file after
 *	name modification (-Z)
 *
 * 2	WRITE ENHANCEMENTS
 * 2.1	Write operation will stop instead of allowing a user to create a flawed
 *	flawed archive (due to any problem).
 * 2.2	Archives written by pax are forced to strictly conform to both the
 *	archive and pax the specific format specifications.
 * 2.3	Blocking size and format is rigidly enforced on writes.
 * 2.4	Formats which may exhibit header overflow problems (they have fields
 *	too small for large file systems, such as inode number storage), use
 *	routines designed to repair this problem. These techniques still
 *	conform to both pax and format specifications, but no longer truncate
 *	these fields. This removes any restrictions on using these archive
 *	formats on large file systems.
 * 2.5	Multiple archive volumes can be written and may span over different
 *	archive devices
 * 2.6	A archive volume record limit allows the user to specify the number
 *	of bytes stored on an archive volume. When reached the user is
 *	prompted for the next archive volume. This is specified with the
 *	non-standard -B flag. The limit is rounded up to the next blocksize.
 * 2.7	All archive padding during write use zero filled sections. This makes
 *	it much easier to pull data out of flawed archive during read
 *	operations.
 * 2.8	Access time reset with the -t applies to all file nodes (including
 *	directories).
 * 2.9	Symbolic links can be followed with -L (optional in the spec).
 * 2.10	Modification or inode change time ranges can be specified via
 *	multiple -T options. These allow a user to select files whose
 *	modification or inode change time lies within a specific time range.
 * 2.11	Files can be selected based on owner (user name or uid) via one or more
 *	-U options.
 * 2.12	Files can be selected based on group (group name or gid) via one o
 *	more -G options.
 * 2.13	Symlinks which appear on the command line can be followed (without
 *	following other symlinks; -H flag)
 *
 * 3	COPY ENHANCEMENTS
 * 3.1	Sparse files (lseek holes) can be copied without expanding the holes
 *	into zero filled blocks. The file copy is created with holes which are
 *	appropriate for the target filesystem
 * 3.2	Access time as well as modification time on copied file trees can be
 *	preserved with the appropriate -p options.
 * 3.3	Access time reset with the -t applies to all file nodes (including
 *	directories).
 * 3.4	Symbolic links can be followed with -L (optional in the spec).
 * 3.5	Modification or inode change time ranges can be specified via
 *	multiple -T options. These allow a user to select files whose
 *	modification or inode change time lies within a specific time range.
 * 3.6	Files can be selected based on owner (user name or uid) via one or more
 *	-U options.
 * 3.7	Files can be selected based on group (group name or gid) via one o
 *	more -G options.
 * 3.8	Symlinks which appear on the command line can be followed (without
 *	following other symlinks; -H flag)
 * 3.9  File inode change time can be checked against existing file before
 *	name modification (-D)
 * 3.10 File inode change time can be checked against existing file after
 *	name modification (-Y)
 * 3.11	File modification time can be checked against existing file after
 *	name modification (-Z)
 *
 * 4	GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS
 * 4.1	Internal structure is designed to isolate format dependent and
 *	independent functions. Formats are selected via a format driver table.
 *	This encourages the addition of new archive formats by only having to
 *	write those routines which id, read and write the archive header.
