 *	removed from the archive. The first byte of the trailer is replaced by
 *	the start of the header of the first file added to the archive. The
 *	format specific end read function tells us how many bytes to move
 *	backwards in the archive to be positioned BEFORE the trailer. Two
 *	different position have to be adjusted, the O.S. file offset (e.g. the
 *	position of the tape head) and the write point within the data we have
 *	stored in the read (soon to become write) buffer. We may have to move
 *	back several records (the number depends on the size of the archive
 *	record and the size of the format trailer) to read up the record where
 *	the first byte of the trailer is recorded. Trailers may span (and
 *	overlap) record boundaries.
 *	We first calculate which record has the first byte of the trailer. We
 *	move the OS file offset back to the start of this record and read it
 *	up. We set the buffer write pointer to be at this byte (the byte where
 *	the trailer starts). We then move the OS file pointer back to the
 *	start of this record so a flush of this buffer will replace the record
 *	in the archive.
 *	A major problem is rewriting this last record. For archives stored
 *	on disk files, this is trivial. However, many devices are really picky
 *	about the conditions under which they will allow a write to occur.
 *	Often devices restrict the conditions where writes can be made,
 *	so it may not be feasible to append archives stored on all types of
