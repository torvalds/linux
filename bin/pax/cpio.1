.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command copies files to and from a
.Nm
archive.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o
Create an archive.
Reads the list of files to store in the
archive from standard input, and writes the archive on standard
output.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A
Append to the specified archive.
.It Fl a
Reset the access times on files that have been copied to the
archive.
.It Fl B
Set block size of output to 5120 bytes.
.It Fl C Ar bytes
Set the block size of output to
.Ar bytes .
.It Fl c
Use ASCII format for
.Nm
header for portability.
.It Fl F Ar archive
Use the specified file as the input for the archive.
.It Fl H Ar format
Write the archive in the specified format.
Recognized formats are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width sv4cpio -compact
.It Ar bcpio
Old binary
.Nm
format.
.It Ar cpio
Old octal character
.Nm
format.
.It Ar pax
POSIX pax format.
.It Ar sv4cpio
SVR4 hex
.Nm
format.
.It Ar tar
Old tar format.
.It Ar ustar
POSIX ustar format.
.El
.It Fl j
Compress archive using the bzip2 format.
The bzip2 utility must be installed separately.
.It Fl L
Follow symbolic links.
.It Fl O Ar archive
Use the specified file name as the archive to write to.
.It Fl v
Be verbose about operations.
List filenames as they are written to the archive.
.It Fl Z

.Xr compress 1
format.
.It Fl z
Compress archive using
.Xr gzip 1
format.
.El
.It Fl i
Restore files from an archive.
Reads the archive file from
standard input and extracts files matching the
.Ar patterns
that were specified on the command line.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 6
Process old-style
.Nm
format archives.
.It Fl B
Set the block size of the archive being read to 5120 bytes.
.It Fl b
Do byte and word swapping after reading in data from the
archive, for restoring archives created on systems with
a different byte order.
.It Fl C Ar bytes
Read archive written with a block size of
.Ar bytes .
.It Fl c
Expect the archive headers to be in ASCII format.
.It Fl d
Create any intermediate directories as needed during
restore.
.It Fl E Ar file
Read list of file name patterns to extract or list from
.Ar file .
.It Fl F Ar archive , Fl I Ar archive
Use the specified file as the input for the archive.
.It Fl f
Restore all files except those matching the
.Ar patterns
given on the command line.
.It Fl H Ar format

.It Fl r
Rename restored files interactively.
.It Fl S
Swap words after reading data from the archive.
.It Fl s
Swap bytes after reading data from the archive.
.It Fl t
Only list the contents of the archive, no files or
directories will be created.
.It Fl u
Overwrite files even when the file in the archive is
older than the one that will be overwritten.
.It Fl v

.El
.It Fl p
Copy files from one location to another in a single pass.
The list of files to copy are read from standard input and
written out to a directory relative to the specified
.Ar directory
argument.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Reset the access times on files that have been copied.
.It Fl d
Create any intermediate directories as needed to write
the files at the new location.
.It Fl L
Follow symbolic links.
.It Fl l
When possible, link files rather than creating an
extra copy.
.It Fl m
Restore modification times on files.
.It Fl u
Overwrite files even when the original file being copied is
older than the one that will be overwritten.
.It Fl v
Be verbose about operations.
List filenames as they are copied.
.El
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev TMPDIR
Path in which to store temporary files.

.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It 0
All files were processed successfully.
.It 1
An error occurred.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Whenever
.Nm
cannot create a file or a link when extracting an archive or cannot
find a file while writing an archive, or cannot preserve the user
ID, group ID, file mode, or access and modification times when the
.Fl p
option is specified, a diagnostic message is written to standard
error and a non-zero exit value will be returned, but processing
will continue.
In the case where
.Nm
cannot create a link to a file,
.Nm
will not create a second copy of the file.
.Pp
If the extraction of a file from an archive is prematurely terminated
by a signal or error,
.Nm
may have only partially extracted the file the user wanted.
Additionally, the file modes of extracted files and directories may
have incorrect file bits, and the modification and access times may
be wrong.
.Pp
If the creation of an archive is prematurely terminated by a signal
or error,
.Nm
may have only partially created the archive, which may violate the
specific archive format specification.

.Sh CAVEATS
Different file formats have different maximum file sizes.
It is recommended that a format such as cpio or ustar
be used for larger files.
.Bl -column "File format" "Maximum file size" -offset indent
.It Sy "File format" Ta Sy "Maximum file size"
.It bcpio Ta "4 Gigabytes"
.It sv4cpio Ta "4 Gigabytes"
.It cpio Ta "8 Gigabytes"
.\" XXX should be "unlimited"
.It pax Ta "8 Gigabytes"
.It tar Ta "8 Gigabytes"
.It ustar Ta "8 Gigabytes"
