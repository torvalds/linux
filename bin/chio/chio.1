.Nm chio
.Nd medium changer control utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm chio
.Op Fl f Ar changer
.Ar command
.Op Ar arg ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to control the operation of medium changers, such as those
found in tape and optical disk jukeboxes.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Fl f Ar changer
Use the device
.Ar changer
rather than the default device
.Pa /dev/ch0 .
.El
.Pp
A medium changer apparatus is made up of
.Em elements .
There are five element types:
.Em picker
(medium transport),
.Em slot
(storage),
.Em portal
(import/export),
.Em drive
(data transfer), and
.Em voltag
(select by volume identifier).
The
.Em voltag
pseudo-element type allows the selection of tapes by their volume code,
which is typically a barcode on the tape.
In this command description, the shorthand
.Sq ET
will be used to represent an element type, and
.Sq EU
will be used to represent an element unit.
For example, to represent
the first robotic arm in the changer, the ET would be
.Dq picker
and the EU would be
.Dq 0 .
.Pp
The following commands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Cm exchange
.Ar src-ET src-EU dst1-ET dst1-EU
.Op Ar dst2-ET dst2-EU
.Op Cm inv1
.Op Cm inv2
.Xc
Performs a media unit exchange operation.
The media unit in
.Ar src-ET Ns / Ns Ar src-EU
is moved to
.Ar dst1-ET Ns / Ns Ar dst1-EU
and the media unit previously in
.Ar dst1-ET Ns / Ns Ar dst1-EU
is moved to
.Ar dst2-ET Ns / Ns Ar dst2-EU .
In the case of a simple exchange,
.Ar dst2-ET Ns / Ns Ar dst2-EU
is omitted and the values
.Ar src-ET Ns / Ns Ar src-EU
are used in their place.
The optional modifiers
.Cm inv1
and
.Cm inv2
specify whether the media units are to be inverted before insertion into
.Ar dst1-ET Ns / Ns Ar dst2-EU
and
.Ar dst2-ET Ns / Ns Ar dst2-EU
respectively.
.Pp
Note that not all medium changers support the
.Cm exchange
operation; the changer must have multiple free pickers or emulate
multiple free pickers with transient storage.
.It Cm getpicker
Report which picker unit the changer is currently configured to use.
.It Xo
.Cm move
.Ar from-ET from-EU to-ET to-EU
.Op Cm inv
.Xc
Moves the media unit from
.Ar from-ET Ns / Ns Ar from-EU
to
.Ar to-ET Ns / Ns Ar to-EU .
If the optional modifier
.Cm inv
is specified, the media unit will be inverted before insertion.
If
.Ar from-ET
is a drive,
.Nm
will first attempt to open and perform an
.Dv MTOFFL
operation on the
.Xr st 4
device corresponding to
.Ar from-EU .
By default, the
.Xr st 4
device
.No /dev/rst Ns Ar X
is used, where
.Ar X
is the
.Ar from-EU .
This mapping can be changed by using the
.Xr chio.conf 5
file.
.It Cm params
Report the number of slots, drives, pickers, and portals in the changer,
and which picker unit the changer is currently configured to use.
.It Cm position Ar to-ET to-EU Op Cm inv
Position the picker in front of the element described by
.Ar to-ET Ns / Ns Ar to-EU .
If the optional modifier
.Cm inv
is specified, the media unit will be inverted before insertion.
.Pp
Note that not all changers behave as expected in response to this command.
.It Cm setpicker Ar unit
Configure the changer to use picker
.Ar unit .
.It Cm status
.Op Fl vVa
.Op Ar ET
Report the status of all elements in the changer.
If
.Ar ET
is specified, report the status of all elements of type
.Ar ET .
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl v
Print the primary volume tag for each loaded medium, if any.
The volume
tag is printed as
.Dq \*(LtLABEL:SERIAL\*(Gt .
.It Fl V
Print the alternate volume tag for each loaded medium, if any.
.It Fl a
Print all additional information (as in
.Fl vV ) .
.El
.Pp
The status bits output are defined as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv FULL
Element contains a media unit.
.It Dv IMPEXP
Media was deposited into element by an outside human operator.
.It Dv EXCEPT
Element is in an abnormal state.
.It Dv ACCESS
Media in this element is accessible by a picker.
.It Dv EXENAB
Element supports passing media (exporting) to an outside human operator.
.It Dv INENAB
Element supports receiving media (importing) from an outside human operator.
.El
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width CHANGER
.It Ev CHANGER
The default changer may be overridden by setting this environmental
variable to the desired changer device.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/chio.confXX"
.It Pa /dev/ch0
Default changer device.
.It Pa /etc/chio.conf
Optional configuration file to set up a non-default mapping between
.Xr st 4
devices and changer drives.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Move the media in slot 3 (fourth slot) to drive 0 (first drive):
.Pp
.Dl # chio move slot 3 drive 0
.Pp
Move the media with volume tag 000007L2 to drive 1 (second drive):
.Pp
.Dl # chio move voltag 00007L2 drive 1
.Pp
Configure the changer to use picker 2 (third picker) for operations:
.Pp
.Dl # chio setpicker 2
