.Sh NAME
.Nm kill
.Nd terminate or signal a process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kill
.Op Fl Ar signal_number | Fl Ar signal_name | Fl s Ar signal_name
.Ar pid ...
.Nm kill
.Fl l
.Op Ar exit_status
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sends a signal to the process(es) specified
by the
.Ar pid
operand(s).
If no signal is specified, the
.Cm TERM
signal is used.
.Pp
Only the superuser may send signals to other users' processes.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l Op Ar exit_status
Display the name of the signal corresponding to
.Ar exit_status .
.Ar exit_status
may be the exit status of a command killed by a signal
(see the
special
.Xr sh 1
parameter
.Sq ?\& )
or a signal number.
.Pp
If no operand is given, display the names of all the signals.
.It Fl Ar signal_number | Fl Ar signal_name | Fl s Ar signal_name
A non-negative decimal integer or a symbolic name
specifying the signal to be sent instead of the default
.Cm TERM .
.El
.Pp
The following PIDs have special meanings:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It \-1
If superuser, broadcast the signal to all processes; otherwise, broadcast
to all processes belonging to the user.
.It 0
Send the signal to all processes whose group ID is equal to the
process group ID of the sender, and for which the process has permission.
.It \- Ns Ar pgid
Send the signal to all processes within the specified process group.
.El
.Pp
Some of the more commonly used signals:
.Pp
.Bl -column MM MMMM -compact -offset indent
.It 1  Ta Cm HUP  Ta Pq hang up
.It 2  Ta Cm INT  Ta Pq interrupt
.It 3  Ta Cm QUIT Ta Pq quit
.It 6  Ta Cm ABRT Ta Pq abort
.It 9  Ta Cm KILL Ta Pq non-catchable, non-ignorable kill
.It 14 Ta Cm ALRM Ta Pq alarm clock
.It 15 Ta Cm TERM Ta Pq software termination signal
.El
.Pp
For a complete list, consult the
.Xr signal 3
manual page.
.Pp
A signal number of 0
.Pq Nm kill Fl 0 Ar pid
does not send a signal, but only checks the validity of a certain PID.
It succeeds if
.Ar pid
exists or raises an error otherwise.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std kill
.Sh EXAMPLES
Forcibly terminate process ID 1234:
.Pp
.Dl $ kill -9 1234
.Pp
Send the
.Xr init 8
process the hangup signal, instructing it to re-read
.Xr ttys 5 :
.Pp
.Dl # kill -HUP 1
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr ksh 1 ,
.Xr pkill 1 ,
.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr kill 2 ,
.Xr signal 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The
.Fl Ar signal_name
and
.Fl Ar signal_number
syntax is marked by
.St -p1003.1-2008
as being an
X/Open System Interfaces
option.
.Pp
.Nm
also exists as a built-in to
.Xr csh 1
and
.Xr ksh 1 ,
though with a different syntax.
