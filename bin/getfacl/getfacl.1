.Sh NAME
.Nm getfacl
.Nd get ACL information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dhinqv
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility writes discretionary access control information associated with
the specified file(s) to standard output.
If the
.Xr getconf 1
utility indicates that
.Brq Va _POSIX_ACL_EXTENDED
is not in effect for a
.Ar file
then the standard discretionary access permissions are interpreted as
an ACL containing only the required ACL entries.
.Pp
The following option is available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
The operation applies to the default ACL of a directory instead of the
access ACL.
An error is generated if a default ACL cannot be associated with
.Ar file .
This option is not valid for NFSv4 ACLs.
.It Fl h
If the target of the operation is a symbolic link, return the ACL from
the symbolic link itself rather than following the link.
.It Fl i
For NFSv4 ACLs, append numerical ID at the end of each entry containing
user or group name.
Ignored for POSIX.1e ACLs.
.It Fl n
Display user and group IDs numerically rather than converting to
a user or group name.
Ignored for POSIX.1e ACLs.
.It Fl q
Do not write commented information about file name and ownership.
This is
useful when dealing with filenames with unprintable characters.
.It Fl v
For NFSv4 ACLs, display access mask and flags in a verbose form.
Ignored for POSIX.1e ACLs.
.El
.Pp
The following operand is available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar file
A pathname of a file whose ACL shall be retrieved.
If
.Ar file
is not specified, or a
.Ar file
is specified as
.Fl ,
then
.Nm
reads a list of pathnames, each terminated by one newline character,
from the standard input.
.El
.Pp
For an explanation of the ACL syntax, see the
.Xr setfacl 1
manual page.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl getfacl /
.Pp
Retrieve ACL for the directory
.Pa / .
.Pp
.Dl getfacl -d /
.Pp
Retrieve the default ACL for the directory
.Pa / ,
if any.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to be
.Tn IEEE
Std 1003.2c compliant.
.Sh HISTORY
Extended Attribute and Access Control List support was developed as part
of the
.Tn TrustedBSD
Project and introduced in
.Fx 5.0 .
