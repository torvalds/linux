.Sh NAME
.Nm pwd
.Nd return working directory name
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl L | P
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility writes the absolute pathname of the current working directory to
the standard output.
.Pp
Some shells may provide a builtin
.Nm
command which is similar or identical to this utility.
Consult the
.Xr builtin 1
manual page.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl L
Display the logical current working directory.
.It Fl P
Display the physical current working directory (all symbolic links resolved).
.El
.Pp
If no options are specified, the
.Fl P
option is assumed.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables used by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev PWD"
.It Ev PWD
Logical current working directory.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr builtin 1 ,
.Xr cd 1 ,
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr getcwd 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v5 .
.Sh BUGS
In
.Xr csh 1
the command
.Ic dirs
is always faster because it is built into that shell.
However, it can give a different answer in the rare case
that the current directory or a containing directory was moved after
the shell descended into it.
.Pp
The
.Fl L
option does not work unless the
.Ev PWD
environment variable is exported by the shell.
