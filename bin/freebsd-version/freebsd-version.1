.Sh NAME
.Nm freebsd-version
.Nd print the version and patch level of the installed system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl kru
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility makes a best effort to determine the version and patch level
of the installed kernel and / or userland.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl k
Print the version and patch level of the installed kernel.
Unlike
.Xr uname 1 ,
if a new kernel has been installed but the system has not yet
rebooted,
.Nm
will print the version and patch level of the new kernel.
.It Fl r
Print the version and patch level of the running kernel.
Unlike
.Xr uname 1 ,
this is unaffected by environment variables.
.It Fl u
Print the version and patch level of the installed userland.
These are hardcoded into
.Nm
during the build.
.El
.Pp
If several of the above options are specified,
.Nm
will print the installed kernel version first, then the running kernel
version, and finally the userland version, on separate lines.
If neither is specified, it will print the userland version only.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The
.Nm
utility should provide the correct answer in the vast majority of
cases, including on systems kept up-to-date using
.Xr freebsd-update 8 ,
which does not update the kernel version unless the kernel itself was
affected by the latest patch.
.Pp
To determine the name (and hence the location) of a custom kernel, the
.Nm
utility will attempt to parse
.Pa /boot/defaults/loader.conf
and
.Pa /boot/loader.conf ,
looking for definitions of the
.Va kernel
and
.Va bootfile
variables, both with a default value of
.Dq kernel .
It may however fail to locate the correct kernel if either or both of
these variables are defined in a non-standard location, such as in
.Pa /boot/loader.rc .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width ROOT
.It Ev ROOT
Path to the root of the filesystem in which to look for
.Pa loader.conf
and the kernel.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To determine the version of the currently running userland:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/bin/freebsd-version -u
.Ed
.Pp
To inspect a system being repaired using a live CD:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mount -rt ufs /dev/ada0p2 /mnt
env ROOT=/mnt /mnt/bin/freebsd-version -ku
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr uname 1 ,
.Xr loader.conf 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Fx 10.0 .
