.Sh NAME
.Nm echo
.Nd write arguments to the standard output
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl n
.Op Ar string ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank
.Pq Ql "\ "
characters and followed by a newline
.Pq Ql \en
character, to the standard
output.
.Pp
The following option is available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl n
Do not print the trailing newline character.
.El
.Pp
The end-of-options marker
.Fl Fl
is not recognized and written literally.
.Pp
The newline may also be suppressed by appending
.Ql \ec
to the end of the string, as is done
by iBCS2 compatible systems.
Note that the
.Fl n
option as well as the effect of
.Ql \ec
are implementation-defined in
.St -p1003.1-2001
as amended by Cor.\& 1-2002.
For portability,
.Nm
should only be used if the first argument does not start with a hyphen
.Pq Ql "-"
and does not contain any backslashes
.Pq Ql "\e" .
If this is not sufficient,
.Xr printf 1
should be used.
.Pp
Most shells provide a builtin
.Nm
command which tends to differ from this utility
in the treatment of options and backslashes.
Consult the
.Xr builtin 1
manual page.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std

.Sh STANDARDS

.Nm
utility conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001
as amended by Cor.\& 1-2002.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v2 .
