#	@(#)nodetypes	8.2 (Berkeley) 5/4/95
# $FreeBSD$

# This file describes the nodes used in parse trees.  Unindented lines
# contain a node type followed by a structure tag.  Subsequent indented
# lines specify the fields of the structure.  Several node types can share
# the same structure, in which case the fields of the structure should be
# specified only once.
#
# A field of a structure is described by the name of the field followed
# by a type.  The currently implemented types are:
#	nodeptr - a pointer to a node
#	nodelist - a pointer to a list of nodes
#	string - a pointer to a nul terminated string
#	int - an integer
#	other - any type that can be copied by assignment
#	temp - a field that doesn't have to be copied when the node is copied
# The last two types should be followed by the text of a C declaration for
# the field.
