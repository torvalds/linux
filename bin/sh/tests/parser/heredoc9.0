# It may be argued that
#   x=$(cat <<EOF
#   foo
#   EOF)
# is a valid complete command that sets x to foo, because
#   cat <<EOF
#   foo
#   EOF
# is a valid script even without the final newline.
# However, if the here-document is not within a new-style command substitution
# or there are other constructs nested inside the command substitution that
# need terminators, the delimiter at the start of a line followed by a close
# parenthesis is clearly a literal part of the here-document.

# This file contains tests that also work with simplistic $(...) parsers.
