config SECURITY_SELINUX
	bool "NSA SELinux Support"
	depends on SECURITY_NETWORK && AUDIT && NET && INET
	select NETWORK_SECMARK
	default n
	help
	  This selects NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux).
	  You will also need a policy configuration and a labeled filesystem.
	  You can obtain the policy compiler (checkpolicy), the utility for
	  labeling filesystems (setfiles), and an example policy configuration
	  from <http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/>.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_BOOTPARAM
	bool "NSA SELinux boot parameter"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default n
	help
	  This option adds a kernel parameter 'selinux', which allows SELinux
	  to be disabled at boot.  If this option is selected, SELinux
	  functionality can be disabled with selinux=0 on the kernel
	  command line.  The purpose of this option is to allow a single
	  kernel image to be distributed with SELinux built in, but not
	  necessarily enabled.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_BOOTPARAM_VALUE
	int "NSA SELinux boot parameter default value"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX_BOOTPARAM
	range 0 1
	default 1
	help
	  This option sets the default value for the kernel parameter
	  'selinux', which allows SELinux to be disabled at boot.  If this
	  option is set to 0 (zero), the SELinux kernel parameter will
	  default to 0, disabling SELinux at bootup.  If this option is
	  set to 1 (one), the SELinux kernel parameter will default to 1,
	  enabling SELinux at bootup.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer 1.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_DISABLE
	bool "NSA SELinux runtime disable"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default n
	help
	  This option enables writing to a selinuxfs node 'disable', which
	  allows SELinux to be disabled at runtime prior to the policy load.
	  SELinux will then remain disabled until the next boot.
	  This option is similar to the selinux=0 boot parameter, but is to
	  support runtime disabling of SELinux, e.g. from /sbin/init, for
	  portability across platforms where boot parameters are difficult
	  to employ.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_DEVELOP
	bool "NSA SELinux Development Support"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default y
	help
	  This enables the development support option of NSA SELinux,
	  which is useful for experimenting with SELinux and developing
	  policies.  If unsure, say Y.  With this option enabled, the
	  kernel will start in permissive mode (log everything, deny nothing)
	  unless you specify enforcing=1 on the kernel command line.  You
	  can interactively toggle the kernel between enforcing mode and
	  permissive mode (if permitted by the policy) via /selinux/enforce.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_AVC_STATS
	bool "NSA SELinux AVC Statistics"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default y
	help
	  This option collects access vector cache statistics to
	  /selinux/avc/cache_stats, which may be monitored via
	  tools such as avcstat.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_CHECKREQPROT_VALUE
	int "NSA SELinux checkreqprot default value"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	range 0 1
	default 1
	help
	  This option sets the default value for the 'checkreqprot' flag
	  that determines whether SELinux checks the protection requested
	  by the application or the protection that will be applied by the
	  kernel (including any implied execute for read-implies-exec) for
	  mmap and mprotect calls.  If this option is set to 0 (zero),
	  SELinux will default to checking the protection that will be applied
	  by the kernel.  If this option is set to 1 (one), SELinux will
	  default to checking the protection requested by the application.
	  The checkreqprot flag may be changed from the default via the
	  'checkreqprot=' boot parameter.  It may also be changed at runtime
	  via /selinux/checkreqprot if authorized by policy.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer 1.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_ENABLE_SECMARK_DEFAULT
	bool "NSA SELinux enable new secmark network controls by default"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default n
	help
	  This option determines whether the new secmark-based network
	  controls will be enabled by default.  If not, the old internal
	  per-packet controls will be enabled by default, preserving
	  old behavior.

	  If you enable the new controls, you will need updated
	  SELinux userspace libraries, tools and policy.  Typically,
	  your distribution will provide these and enable the new controls
	  in the kernel they also distribute.

	  Note that this option can be overridden at boot with the
	  selinux_compat_net parameter, and after boot via
	  /selinux/compat_net.  See Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
	  for details on this parameter.

	  If you enable the new network controls, you will likely
	  also require the SECMARK and CONNSECMARK targets, as
	  well as any conntrack helpers for protocols which you
	  wish to control.

	  If you are unsure what to do here, select N.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_POLICYDB_VERSION_MAX
	bool "NSA SELinux maximum supported policy format version"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default n
	help
	  This option enables the maximum policy format version supported
	  by SELinux to be set to a particular value.  This value is reported
	  to userspace via /selinux/policyvers and used at policy load time.
	  It can be adjusted downward to support legacy userland (init) that
	  does not correctly handle kernels that support newer policy versions.

	  Examples:
	  For the Fedora Core 3 or 4 Linux distributions, enable this option
	  and set the value via the next option. For Fedora Core 5 and later,
	  do not enable this option.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_POLICYDB_VERSION_MAX_VALUE
	int "NSA SELinux maximum supported policy format version value"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX_POLICYDB_VERSION_MAX
	range 15 21
	default 19
	help
	  This option sets the value for the maximum policy format version
	  supported by SELinux.

	  Examples:
	  For Fedora Core 3, use 18.
	  For Fedora Core 4, use 19.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, look for the
	  policy format version supported by your policy toolchain, by
	  running 'checkpolicy -V'. Or look at what policy you have
	  installed under /etc/selinux/$SELINUXTYPE/policy, where
	  SELINUXTYPE is defined in your /etc/selinux/config.
