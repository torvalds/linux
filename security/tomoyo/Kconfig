	  This selects TOMOYO Linux, pathname-based access control.
	  Required userspace tools and further information may be
	  found at <https://tomoyo.sourceforge.net/>.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

	default 2048
	range 0 2147483647
	depends on SECURITY_TOMOYO
	help
	  This is the default value for maximal ACL entries
	  that are automatically appended into policy at "learning mode".
	  Some programs access thousands of objects, so running
	  such programs in "learning mode" dulls the system response
	  and consumes much memory.
	  This is the safeguard for such programs.

config SECURITY_TOMOYO_MAX_AUDIT_LOG
	int "Default maximal count for audit log"
	default 1024
	range 0 2147483647
	depends on SECURITY_TOMOYO
	help
	  This is the default value for maximal entries for
	  audit logs that the kernel can hold on memory.
	  You can read the log via /sys/kernel/security/tomoyo/audit.
	  If you don't need audit logs, you may set this value to 0.

config SECURITY_TOMOYO_OMIT_USERSPACE_LOADER
	bool "Activate without calling userspace policy loader."
	default n
	depends on SECURITY_TOMOYO
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to activate access control as soon as built-in
	  policy was loaded. This option will be useful for systems where
	  operations which can lead to the hijacking of the boot sequence are
	  needed before loading the policy. For example, you can activate
	  immediately after loading the fixed part of policy which will allow
	  only operations needed for mounting a partition which contains the
	  variant part of policy and verifying (e.g. running GPG check) and
	  loading the variant part of policy. Since you can start using
	  enforcing mode from the beginning, you can reduce the possibility of
	  hijacking the boot sequence.

	  This is the default pathname of policy loader which is called before
	  activation. You can override this setting via TOMOYO_loader= kernel
	  command line option.

config SECURITY_TOMOYO_ACTIVATION_TRIGGER
	string "Trigger for calling userspace policy loader"
	default "/sbin/init"
	depends on SECURITY_TOMOYO
	depends on !SECURITY_TOMOYO_OMIT_USERSPACE_LOADER
	help
	  This is the default pathname of activation trigger.
	  You can override this setting via TOMOYO_trigger= kernel command line
	  option. For example, if you pass init=/bin/systemd option, you may
	  want to also pass TOMOYO_trigger=/bin/systemd option.

config SECURITY_TOMOYO_INSECURE_BUILTIN_SETTING
	bool "Use insecure built-in settings for fuzzing tests."
	default n
	depends on SECURITY_TOMOYO
	select SECURITY_TOMOYO_OMIT_USERSPACE_LOADER
	help
	  Enabling this option forces minimal built-in policy and disables
	  domain/program checks for run-time policy modifications. Please enable
	  this option only if this kernel is built for doing fuzzing tests.
