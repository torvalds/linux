config INTEGRITY
	bool "Integrity subsystem"
	depends on SECURITY
	default y
	help
	  This option enables the integrity subsystem, which is comprised
	  of a number of different components including the Integrity
	  Measurement Architecture (IMA), Extended Verification Module
	  (EVM), IMA-appraisal extension, digital signature verification
	  extension and audit measurement log support.

	  Each of these components can be enabled/disabled separately.
	  Refer to the individual components for additional details.

config INTEGRITY_SIGNATURE
	bool "Digital signature verification using multiple keyrings"
	default n
	select KEYS
	select SIGNATURE
	help
	  This option enables digital signature verification support
	  using multiple keyrings. It defines separate keyrings for each
	  of the different use cases - evm, ima, and modules.
	  Different keyrings improves search performance, but also allow
	  to "lock" certain keyring to prevent adding new keys.
	  This is useful for evm and module keyrings, when keys are
	  usually only added from initramfs.

	  This option enables digital signature verification using
	  asymmetric keys.

	bool "Require all keys on the integrity keyrings be signed"
	depends on SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYRING
	depends on INTEGRITY_ASYMMETRIC_KEYS
	default y
	help
	   This option requires that all keys added to the .ima and
	   .evm keyrings be signed by a key on the system trusted
	   keyring.

        help
         Provide a separate, distinct keyring for platform trusted keys, which
         the kernel automatically populates during initialization from values
         provided by the platform for verifying the kexec'ed kerned image
         and, possibly, the initramfs signature.

	help
	 If set, provide a keyring to which Machine Owner Keys (MOK) may
	 be added. This keyring shall contain just MOK keys.  Unlike keys
	 in the platform keyring, keys contained in the .machine keyring will
	 be trusted within the kernel.

config INTEGRITY_AUDIT
	bool "Enables integrity auditing support "
	depends on AUDIT
	default y
	help
	  In addition to enabling integrity auditing support, this
	  option adds a kernel parameter 'integrity_audit', which
	  controls the level of integrity auditing messages.
	  0 - basic integrity auditing messages (default)
	  1 - additional integrity auditing messages

	  Additional informational integrity auditing messages would
	  be enabled by specifying 'integrity_audit=1' on the kernel
	  command line.
