config KEYS
	bool "Enable access key retention support"
	help
	  This option provides support for retaining authentication tokens and
	  access keys in the kernel.

	  It also includes provision of methods by which such keys might be
	  associated with a process so that network filesystems, encryption
	  support and the like can find them.

	  Furthermore, a special type of key is available that acts as keyring:
	  a searchable sequence of keys. Each process is equipped with access
	  to five standard keyrings: UID-specific, GID-specific, session,
	  process and thread.

	  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.

config TRUSTED_KEYS
	tristate "TRUSTED KEYS"
	depends on KEYS && TCG_TPM
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_HMAC
	select CRYPTO_SHA1
	help
	  This option provides support for creating, sealing, and unsealing
	  keys in the kernel. Trusted keys are random number symmetric keys,
	  generated and RSA-sealed by the TPM. The TPM only unseals the keys,
	  if the boot PCRs and other criteria match.  Userspace will only ever
	  see encrypted blobs.

	  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.

config ENCRYPTED_KEYS
	tristate "ENCRYPTED KEYS"
	depends on KEYS
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_HMAC
	select CRYPTO_AES
	select CRYPTO_CBC
	select CRYPTO_SHA256
	select CRYPTO_RNG
	help
	  This option provides support for create/encrypting/decrypting keys
	  in the kernel.  Encrypted keys are kernel generated random numbers,
	  which are encrypted/decrypted with a 'master' symmetric key. The
	  'master' key can be either a trusted-key or user-key type.
	  Userspace only ever sees/stores encrypted blobs.

	  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.

config KEYS_DEBUG_PROC_KEYS
	bool "Enable the /proc/keys file by which keys may be viewed"
	depends on KEYS
	help
	  This option turns on support for the /proc/keys file - through which
	  can be listed all the keys on the system that are viewable by the
	  reading process.

	  The only keys included in the list are those that grant View
	  permission to the reading process whether or not it possesses them.
	  Note that LSM security checks are still performed, and may further
	  filter out keys that the current process is not authorised to view.

	  Only key attributes are listed here; key payloads are not included in
	  the resulting table.

	  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.

config SECURITY_DMESG_RESTRICT
	bool "Restrict unprivileged access to the kernel syslog"
	default n
	help
	  This enforces restrictions on unprivileged users reading the kernel
	  syslog via dmesg(8).

	  If this option is not selected, no restrictions will be enforced
	  unless the dmesg_restrict sysctl is explicitly set to (1).

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY
	bool "Enable different security models"
	depends on SYSFS
	help
	  This allows you to choose different security modules to be
	  configured into your kernel.

	  If this option is not selected, the default Linux security
	  model will be used.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITYFS
	bool "Enable the securityfs filesystem"
	help
	  This will build the securityfs filesystem.  It is currently used by
	  the TPM bios character driver and IMA, an integrity provider.  It is
	  not used by SELinux or SMACK.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_NETWORK
	bool "Socket and Networking Security Hooks"
	depends on SECURITY
	help
	  This enables the socket and networking security hooks.
	  If enabled, a security module can use these hooks to
	  implement socket and networking access controls.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_NETWORK_XFRM
	bool "XFRM (IPSec) Networking Security Hooks"
	depends on XFRM && SECURITY_NETWORK
	help
	  This enables the XFRM (IPSec) networking security hooks.
	  If enabled, a security module can use these hooks to
	  implement per-packet access controls based on labels
	  derived from IPSec policy.  Non-IPSec communications are
	  designated as unlabelled, and only sockets authorized
	  to communicate unlabelled data can send without using
	  IPSec.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_PATH
	bool "Security hooks for pathname based access control"
	depends on SECURITY
	help
	  This enables the security hooks for pathname based access control.
	  If enabled, a security module can use these hooks to
	  implement pathname based access controls.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config INTEL_TXT
	bool "Enable Intel(R) Trusted Execution Technology (Intel(R) TXT)"
	depends on HAVE_INTEL_TXT
	help
	  This option enables support for booting the kernel with the
	  Trusted Boot (tboot) module. This will utilize
	  Intel(R) Trusted Execution Technology to perform a measured launch
	  of the kernel. If the system does not support Intel(R) TXT, this
	  will have no effect.

	  Intel TXT will provide higher assurance of system configuration and
	  initial state as well as data reset protection.  This is used to
	  create a robust initial kernel measurement and verification, which
	  helps to ensure that kernel security mechanisms are functioning
	  correctly. This level of protection requires a root of trust outside
	  of the kernel itself.

	  Intel TXT also helps solve real end user concerns about having
	  confidence that their hardware is running the VMM or kernel that
	  it was configured with, especially since they may be responsible for
	  providing such assurances to VMs and services running on it.

	  See <http://www.intel.com/technology/security/> for more information
	  about Intel(R) TXT.
	  See <http://tboot.sourceforge.net> for more information about tboot.
	  See Documentation/intel_txt.txt for a description of how to enable
	  Intel TXT support in a kernel boot.

	  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.

config LSM_MMAP_MIN_ADDR
	int "Low address space for LSM to protect from user allocation"
	depends on SECURITY && SECURITY_SELINUX
	default 32768 if ARM
	default 65536
	help
	  This is the portion of low virtual memory which should be protected
	  from userspace allocation.  Keeping a user from writing to low pages
	  can help reduce the impact of kernel NULL pointer bugs.

	  For most ia64, ppc64 and x86 users with lots of address space
	  a value of 65536 is reasonable and should cause no problems.
	  On arm and other archs it should not be higher than 32768.
	  Programs which use vm86 functionality or have some need to map
	  this low address space will need the permission specific to the
	  systems running LSM.
