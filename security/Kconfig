config SECURITY_DMESG_RESTRICT
	bool "Restrict unprivileged access to the kernel syslog"
	default n
	help
	  This enforces restrictions on unprivileged users reading the kernel
	  syslog via dmesg(8).

	  If this option is not selected, no restrictions will be enforced
	  unless the dmesg_restrict sysctl is explicitly set to (1).

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

choice
	prompt "Allow /proc/pid/mem access override"
	default PROC_MEM_ALWAYS_FORCE
	help
	  Traditionally /proc/pid/mem allows users to override memory
	  permissions for users like ptrace, assuming they have ptrace
	  capability.

	  This allows people to limit that - either never override, or
	  require actual active ptrace attachment.

	  Defaults to the traditional behavior (for now)

config PROC_MEM_ALWAYS_FORCE
	bool "Traditional /proc/pid/mem behavior"
	help
	  This allows /proc/pid/mem accesses to override memory mapping
	  permissions if you have ptrace access rights.

config PROC_MEM_FORCE_PTRACE
	bool "Require active ptrace() use for access override"
	help
	  This allows /proc/pid/mem accesses to override memory mapping
	  permissions for active ptracers like gdb.

config PROC_MEM_NO_FORCE
	bool "Never"
	help
	  Never override memory mapping permissions

config SECURITY
	bool "Enable different security models"
	depends on SYSFS
	depends on MULTIUSER
	help
	  This allows you to choose different security modules to be
	  configured into your kernel.

	  If this option is not selected, the default Linux security
	  model will be used.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config HAS_SECURITY_AUDIT
	def_bool y
	depends on AUDIT
	depends on SECURITY

config SECURITYFS
	bool "Enable the securityfs filesystem"
	help
	  This will build the securityfs filesystem.  It is currently used by
	  various security modules (AppArmor, IMA, SafeSetID, TOMOYO, TPM).

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_NETWORK
	bool "Socket and Networking Security Hooks"
	depends on SECURITY
	help
	  This enables the socket and networking security hooks.
	  If enabled, a security module can use these hooks to
	  implement socket and networking access controls.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_INFINIBAND
	bool "Infiniband Security Hooks"
	depends on SECURITY && INFINIBAND
	help
	  This enables the Infiniband security hooks.
	  If enabled, a security module can use these hooks to
	  implement Infiniband access controls.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_NETWORK_XFRM
	bool "XFRM (IPSec) Networking Security Hooks"
	depends on XFRM && SECURITY_NETWORK
	help
	  This enables the XFRM (IPSec) networking security hooks.
	  If enabled, a security module can use these hooks to
	  implement per-packet access controls based on labels
	  derived from IPSec policy.  Non-IPSec communications are
	  designated as unlabelled, and only sockets authorized
	  to communicate unlabelled data can send without using
	  IPSec.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_PATH
	bool "Security hooks for pathname based access control"
	depends on SECURITY
	help
	  This enables the security hooks for pathname based access control.
	  If enabled, a security module can use these hooks to
	  implement pathname based access controls.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config INTEL_TXT
	bool "Enable Intel(R) Trusted Execution Technology (Intel(R) TXT)"
	depends on HAVE_INTEL_TXT
	help
	  This option enables support for booting the kernel with the
	  Trusted Boot (tboot) module. This will utilize
	  Intel(R) Trusted Execution Technology to perform a measured launch
	  of the kernel. If the system does not support Intel(R) TXT, this
	  will have no effect.

	  Intel TXT will provide higher assurance of system configuration and
	  initial state as well as data reset protection.  This is used to
	  create a robust initial kernel measurement and verification, which
	  helps to ensure that kernel security mechanisms are functioning
	  correctly. This level of protection requires a root of trust outside
	  of the kernel itself.

	  Intel TXT also helps solve real end user concerns about having
	  confidence that their hardware is running the VMM or kernel that
	  it was configured with, especially since they may be responsible for
	  providing such assurances to VMs and services running on it.

	  See <https://www.intel.com/technology/security/> for more information
	  about Intel(R) TXT.
	  See <http://tboot.sourceforge.net> for more information about tboot.
	  See Documentation/arch/x86/intel_txt.rst for a description of how to enable
	  Intel TXT support in a kernel boot.

	  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.

config LSM_MMAP_MIN_ADDR
	int "Low address space for LSM to protect from user allocation"
	depends on SECURITY && SECURITY_SELINUX
	default 32768 if ARM || (ARM64 && COMPAT)
	default 65536
	help
	  This is the portion of low virtual memory which should be protected
	  from userspace allocation.  Keeping a user from writing to low pages
	  can help reduce the impact of kernel NULL pointer bugs.

	  For most ia64, ppc64 and x86 users with lots of address space
	  a value of 65536 is reasonable and should cause no problems.
	  On arm and other archs it should not be higher than 32768.
	  Programs which use vm86 functionality or have some need to map
	  this low address space will need the permission specific to the
	  systems running LSM.

config STATIC_USERMODEHELPER
	bool "Force all usermode helper calls through a single binary"
	help
	  By default, the kernel can call many different userspace
	  binary programs through the "usermode helper" kernel
	  interface.  Some of these binaries are statically defined
	  either in the kernel code itself, or as a kernel configuration
	  option.  However, some of these are dynamically created at
	  runtime, or can be modified after the kernel has started up.
	  To provide an additional layer of security, route all of these
	  calls through a single executable that can not have its name
	  changed.

	  Note, it is up to this single binary to then call the relevant
	  "real" usermode helper binary, based on the first argument
	  passed to it.  If desired, this program can filter and pick
	  and choose what real programs are called.

	  If you wish for all usermode helper programs are to be
	  disabled, choose this option and then set
	  STATIC_USERMODEHELPER_PATH to an empty string.

config STATIC_USERMODEHELPER_PATH
	string "Path to the static usermode helper binary"
	depends on STATIC_USERMODEHELPER
	default "/sbin/usermode-helper"
	help
	  The binary called by the kernel when any usermode helper
	  program is wish to be run.  The "real" application's name will
	  be in the first argument passed to this program on the command
	  line.

	  If you wish for all usermode helper programs to be disabled,
	  specify an empty string here (i.e. "").
