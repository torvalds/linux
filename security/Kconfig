config KEYS
	bool "Enable access key retention support"
	help
	  This option provides support for retaining authentication tokens and
	  access keys in the kernel.

	  It also includes provision of methods by which such keys might be
	  associated with a process so that network filesystems, encryption
	  support and the like can find them.

	  Furthermore, a special type of key is available that acts as keyring:
	  a searchable sequence of keys. Each process is equipped with access
	  to five standard keyrings: UID-specific, GID-specific, session,
	  process and thread.

	  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.

config KEYS_DEBUG_PROC_KEYS
	bool "Enable the /proc/keys file by which all keys may be viewed"
	depends on KEYS
	help
	  This option turns on support for the /proc/keys file through which
	  all the keys on the system can be listed.

	  This option is a slight security risk in that it makes it possible
	  for anyone to see all the keys on the system. Normally the manager
	  pretends keys that are inaccessible to a process don't exist as far
	  as that process is concerned.

config SECURITY
	bool "Enable different security models"
	depends on SYSFS
	help
	  This allows you to choose different security modules to be
	  configured into your kernel.

	  If this option is not selected, the default Linux security
	  model will be used.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_NETWORK
	bool "Socket and Networking Security Hooks"
	depends on SECURITY
	help
	  This enables the socket and networking security hooks.
	  If enabled, a security module can use these hooks to
	  implement socket and networking access controls.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_CAPABILITIES
	tristate "Default Linux Capabilities"
	depends on SECURITY
	help
	  This enables the "default" Linux capabilities functionality.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer Y.

config SECURITY_ROOTPLUG
	tristate "Root Plug Support"
	depends on USB && SECURITY
	help
	  This is a sample LSM module that should only be used as such.
	  It prevents any programs running with egid == 0 if a specific
	  USB device is not present in the system.

	  See <http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6279> for
	  more information about this module.
	  
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_SECLVL
	tristate "BSD Secure Levels"
	depends on SECURITY
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_SHA1
	help
	  Implements BSD Secure Levels as an LSM.  See
	  <file:Documentation/seclvl.txt> for instructions on how to use this
	  module.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.
