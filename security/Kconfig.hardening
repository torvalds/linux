	help
	  While the kernel is built with warnings enabled for any missed
	  stack variable initializations, this warning is silenced for
	  anything passed by reference to another function, under the
	  occasionally misguided assumption that the function will do
	  the initialization. As this regularly leads to exploitable
	  flaws, this plugin is available to identify and zero-initialize
	  such variables, depending on the chosen level of coverage.

	  This option enables initialization of stack variables at
	  function entry time. This has the possibility to have the
	  greatest coverage (since all functions can have their
	  variables initialized), but the performance impact depends
	  on the function calling complexity of a given workload's
	  syscalls.

	  This chooses the level of coverage over classes of potentially
	  uninitialized variables. The selected class of variable will be
	  initialized before use in a function.

	config INIT_STACK_NONE

		  Initializes everything on the stack (including padding)

		  all classes of uninitialized stack variable exploits and
		  information exposures, even variables that were warned about
		  having been left uninitialized.

		  Pattern initialization is known to provoke many existing bugs
		  related to uninitialized locals, e.g. pointers receive
		  non-NULL values, buffer sizes and indices are very big. The
		  pattern is situation-specific; Clang on 64-bit uses 0xAA
		  repeating for all types and padding except float and double
		  which use 0xFF repeating (-NaN). Clang on 32-bit uses 0xFF
		  repeating for all types and padding.

	config INIT_STACK_ALL_ZERO

		  Initializes everything on the stack (including padding)
		  with a zero value. This is intended to eliminate all
		  classes of uninitialized stack variable exploits and
		  information exposures, even variables that were warned
		  about having been left uninitialized.

		  Zero initialization provides safe defaults for strings
		  (immediately NUL-terminated), pointers (NULL), indices
		  (index 0), and sizes (0 length), so it is therefore more
		  suitable as a production security mitigation than pattern
		  initialization.

config GCC_PLUGIN_STRUCTLEAK_VERBOSE
	bool "Report forcefully initialized variables"
	depends on GCC_PLUGIN_STRUCTLEAK
	depends on !COMPILE_TEST	# too noisy
	help
	  This option will cause a warning to be printed each time the
	  structleak plugin finds a variable it thinks needs to be
	  initialized. Since not all existing initializers are detected
	  by the plugin, this can produce false positive warnings.

config GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK
	bool "Poison kernel stack before returning from syscalls"
	depends on GCC_PLUGINS
	depends on HAVE_ARCH_STACKLEAK
	help
	  This option makes the kernel erase the kernel stack before
	  returning from system calls. This has the effect of leaving
	  the stack initialized to the poison value, which both reduces
	  the lifetime of any sensitive stack contents and reduces
	  potential for uninitialized stack variable exploits or information
	  exposures (it does not cover functions reaching the same stack
	  depth as prior functions during the same syscall). This blocks
	  most uninitialized stack variable attacks, with the performance
	  impact being driven by the depth of the stack usage, rather than
	  the function calling complexity.

	  The performance impact on a single CPU system kernel compilation
	  sees a 1% slowdown, other systems and workloads may vary and you
	  are advised to test this feature on your expected workload before
	  deploying it.

	depends on GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK
	help
	  The STACKLEAK gcc plugin instruments the kernel code for tracking
	  the lowest border of the kernel stack (and for some other purposes).
	  It inserts the stackleak_track_stack() call for the functions with
	  a stack frame size greater than or equal to this parameter.
	  If unsure, leave the default value 100.

config STACKLEAK_METRICS

	help
	  If this is set, STACKLEAK metrics for every task are available in
	  the /proc file system. In particular, /proc/<pid>/stack_depth
	  shows the maximum kernel stack consumption for the current and
	  previous syscalls. Although this information is not precise, it
	  can be useful for estimating the STACKLEAK performance impact for
	  your workloads.

config STACKLEAK_RUNTIME_DISABLE

	  This option provides 'stack_erasing' sysctl, which can be used in

	  CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK.

config INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON
	bool "Enable heap memory zeroing on allocation by default"
	help
	  This has the effect of setting "init_on_alloc=1" on the kernel
	  command line. This can be disabled with "init_on_alloc=0".
	  When "init_on_alloc" is enabled, all page allocator and slab
	  allocator memory will be zeroed when allocated, eliminating
	  many kinds of "uninitialized heap memory" flaws, especially
	  heap content exposures. The performance impact varies by
	  workload, but most cases see <1% impact. Some synthetic
	  workloads have measured as high as 7%.

config INIT_ON_FREE_DEFAULT_ON
	bool "Enable heap memory zeroing on free by default"
	help
	  This has the effect of setting "init_on_free=1" on the kernel
	  command line. This can be disabled with "init_on_free=0".
	  Similar to "init_on_alloc", when "init_on_free" is enabled,
	  all page allocator and slab allocator memory will be zeroed
	  when freed, eliminating many kinds of "uninitialized heap memory"
	  flaws, especially heap content exposures. The primary difference
	  with "init_on_free" is that data lifetime in memory is reduced,
	  as anything freed is wiped immediately, making live forensics or
	  cold boot memory attacks unable to recover freed memory contents.
	  The performance impact varies by workload, but is more expensive
	  than "init_on_alloc" due to the negative cache effects of
	  touching "cold" memory areas. Most cases see 3-5% impact. Some
	  synthetic workloads have measured as high as 8%.

config CC_HAS_ZERO_CALL_USED_REGS

config ZERO_CALL_USED_REGS
	bool "Enable register zeroing on function exit"
	depends on CC_HAS_ZERO_CALL_USED_REGS
	help
	  At the end of functions, always zero any caller-used register
	  contents. This helps ensure that temporary values are not
	  leaked beyond the function boundary. This means that register
	  contents are less likely to be available for side channels
	  and information exposures. Additionally, this helps reduce the
	  number of useful ROP gadgets by about 20% (and removes compiler
	  generated "write-what-where" gadgets) in the resulting kernel
	  image. This has a less than 1% performance impact on most
	  workloads. Image size growth depends on architecture, and should
	  be evaluated for suitability. For example, x86_64 grows by less
	  than 1%, and arm64 grows by about 5%.
