The default configuration of the MACHINE systems comes with a Linux
installation on the disk (either an IDE hard drive, or a CompactFlash
card). At the moment, there is no known way to log in this installation
as ``root'' or interrupt the boot process, and start an OpenBSD
installation procedure.

Because of this, the only way to boot the OpenBSD install is to copy
the miniroot "miniroot{:--:}OSrev.img" image to the hard drive or CompactFlash
(on the other hand, upgrades can be started by copying bsd.rd to the
 OpenBSD disk and booting from it).

As a result, you will need another machine to plug the machine's disk
or CompactFlash in. Any machine type will do, as long as it supports
ATA-compatible storage devices, regardless of the partition scheme
it uses. Under OpenBSD, it will appear as a ``wd'' device, for example
``wd1''.

Use the dd(1) utility to copy the miniroot to the hard drive.
The command would likely be, under OpenBSD:
	dd if=miniroot{:--:}OSrev.img of=/dev/rwd1c
Replace ``rwd1c'' with the appropriate device name for the raw device
on the system used to do the copy.

If the machine has a hard drive, and you had to change jumpers on it
to change its ``master'' status, do not forget to configure it back
to ``master'' or ``single drive'', as slave drives are not bootable.

dnl I need to write a comprehensive text, also explaining that Rx/Tx
dnl are swapped between the CF and HD models.
In addition to the disk preparation, you will need to connect a serial
port connector to the machine. Please refer to the OpenBSD/MACHINE
page at

for more information.
