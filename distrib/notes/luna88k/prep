dnl Need to provide a short monitor description. Start from

dnl and also document NVRAM?

LUNA-88K do not require any specific preparation prior to the OpenBSD
installation. However, you might want to get familiar with the PROM
interface, in order to be able to boot the installation media and, later,
specify the correct boot parameters.

Setting up the boot device and filename:

  Boot device and filename information is stored by the PROM into
  the machine's non-volatile memory.

  LUNA-88K systems can only boot from SCSI devices. The boot device type
  (such as ``sd'' for a disk) is specified by the
  ``boot_device'' variable. The SCSI id of the boot device is specified
  by the ``boot_unit'' NVRAM variable, and the boot partition on said
  device is specified by the ``boot_partition'' variable. The
  ``boot_filename'' variable stores the name of the file to boot, and
  defaults to ``vmunix''. To boot OpenBSD, this variable should be
  changed to ``boot'', as in:

    0> nvram boot_filename boot

  The ``boot_unit'' value is an encoding of the device SCSI identifier.
  If the boot device is an SCSI disk (``sd''), the value of ``boot_unit''
  should be (6 - ID). On LUNA-88K2 systems, if the boot device is connected
  to the external SCSI connector, 10 should be added to the value of
  ``boot_unit''. Thus booting off an external SCSI disk of ID #0 would
  be 16 on a LUNA-88K2, and 6 on a LUNA-88K.

Setting up the boot behaviour:

  Unlike other platforms, boot behaviour is controlled by the front panel
  DIP switches only.

  The first set of DIP switches in the front panel (DIP SW1) is used to
  select the machine behaviour upon powerup, as well as the preferred
  console device.

  The meaning of these switches will depend upon your particular machine.
  On the LUNA-88K, the 'down' position is 'on', and the 'up' position is
  'off', while the LUNA-88K2 uses the opposite convention (i.e. 'up' is
  'on' and 'down' is 'off').

  If the leftmost switch in SW1, #1, is in the 'off' position, the system
  will auto-boot from the boot device saved in NVRAM (using the
  ``boot_device'', ``boot_unit'' and ``boot_filename'' variables). Otherwise,
  the boot process will stop at the PROM prompt.

Setting up serial console:

  The second switch in SW1, #2, selects the console device. When in the 'on'
  position, it selects the serial console port as the console; otherwise,
  the graphics display and keyboard are used as the console.

  While the LUNA-88K2 uses ``standard'' DB9 serial ports, the earlier
  LUNA-88K have a specific connector, HiRose QM10-14R(L)-PR. Wiring
  information for this connector can be found at the following URL:

  A suitable cable connector for this port would be either HiRose
  QM30-14PA-EP with a QM14-CS cover (with lock), or QM30-14P-EP with a
  QM14-CY cover (without lock).
