	The fdisk(8) utility will be invoked to let you edit your MBR
	partitioning.  The current MBR partitions defined will be
	displayed and you will be allowed to modify them, and add new
	partitions.

	The setup will need two partitions, one 'OpenBSD' for the
	OpenBSD/MACHINE installation, and one 'MSDOS' for the
	U-Boot scripts/bootloader.

	If you use the whole disk option, the install script
	will create a small 'MSDOS' partition and use the rest of
	the disk for the OpenBSD installation.

	After your OpenBSD MBR partition has been set up, the real
	partition setup can follow.

OpenBSDCongratulations

As you may have seen during installation, on some systems OpenBSD/MACHINE
will configure the system console (displaying kernel messages, panics, and
so on) to use the serial interface even though it has video hardware.
To use video output on the framebuffer instead, you may add "set tty fb0"
to /etc/boot.conf.

In these cases the installer question about running X11 is not displayed;
to start an X11 display manager at boot, use "rcctl enable xenodm".
