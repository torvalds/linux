Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	CD-ROM
	FFS partitions
	HTTP

If you can burn the bootable CD-ROM mini image, you can boot from it.

OpenBSDXferCDROM

If you do not have a CD-ROM drive on your alpha:

	You can copy the miniroot image onto the hard disk you intend to
	install OpenBSD on.  Doing so will overwrite the disk's old contents,
	however.

	You must use a Unix-like system to write the miniroot image
	to the hard disk you will be using for OpenBSD/MACHINE.  You
	should use the "dd" command to copy the file system image
	(miniroot{:--:}OSrev.img) directly to the raw 'c'
	device (whole disk) of the target hard disk.  It is suggested
	that you read the dd(1) manual page or ask your system
	administrator to determine the correct set of arguments to use;
	it will be slightly different from system to system, and a
	comprehensive list of the possibilities is beyond the scope of
	this document.
