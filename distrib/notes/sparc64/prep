If your UltraSPARC machine is somewhat old, it might need a firmware update
before it can be used under OpenBSD. You are advised to try to install
OpenBSD first; if it can't boot or fails mysteriously, you might need to
update your firmware. To do so, check the ``Updating your firmware''
section later in this document.

Your OpenBOOT ROM may need some setup.  You cannot use the security modes
of the OpenBOOT ROM.  Make sure that the ROM security modes are disabled:

    ok setenv security-mode none


Most of the new Ultras shipped by Sun (or Oracle) with a preinstalled Solaris
have an initial specific factory setup of the boot ROM, in order to start up
Solaris WebStart at the first boot; the boot-device variable is set to
disk:f.  Make sure you reset the boot device to its default value:

    ok set-default boot-device

will work for most systems. This can be adapted if you've multiple
systems installed and know what you're doing.

To disable automatic boot use the following command:

    ok setenv auto-boot? false

and then to enable it later use:

    ok setenv auto-boot? true

or on an installed system use the eeprom(8) command:

    # eeprom 'auto-boot?=true'

Updating your firmware:
-----------------------

If OpenBSD does not boot or install properly on your machine, it might need
a firmware update.

Updating your firmware is a dangerous operation which may damage your
hardware. Be sure to carefully follow these instructions and, if in doubt,
please don't do this.

You will need to have a working operating system installed on your machine,
in order to perform the update.  If this is not the case, you might be able
to boot the flash updater software via network, but this has not been tested
and is not supported by Oracle.
