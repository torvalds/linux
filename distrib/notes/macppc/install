Before you begin, you should decide if OpenBSD is to be installed
on the whole disk or share the disk with Mac OS.

For stand-alone (No Mac OS installed) or dedicated disks, the MBR
installation method should be chosen and no additional prep is necessary.

If the disk is to be shared with Mac OS, a partition must be preallocated
by the Mac OS partition editor and Mac OS installed to the proper partition.
This expects that the HFS partition will be the first partition on
the disk, and then the OpenBSD partition will follow.
This may require the disk be reformatted using the "Drive Setup" application
and reinstalled under Mac OS.

	At this time, the system can be installed from the supplied
	CD-ROM boot image, by network loading the bootloader, or loading
	the bootloader and kernel from an HFS partition.

	Once the bootloader is installed on the local hard drive, the
	system can boot from it. OpenBSD may share a drive with Mac OS
	if the process is followed carefully. Currently it is
	necessary to use Open Firmware commands to dual boot between
	OS's, or multiple drives may be used with each OS owning drive(s).
	It is also possible on some newer models to set up the system
	to auto boot OpenBSD and if Mac OS is desired, choose it using
	the firmware boot selector by holding down the <option> key
	during reboot and selecting the Mac OS Disk icon.

	(Refer to "Preparing your System for OpenBSD Installation" above
	 for information on how to access and boot from Open Firmware.)

	Disks on OpenBSD/MACHINE are partitioned either using Apple-style
	HFS partitions, or MBR partitions.

	OpenBSD/MACHINE can share a disk with Mac OS or Mac OS X by using
	an HFS partitioned disk. For proper layout, the disk should be
	partitioned with Mac OS or Mac OS X first with unused space or a
	spare partition where OpenBSD can be installed.

	The installation program will ask you whether you intend to use
	HFS or MBR partitions.

	HFS partitioning:

		HFS partition tables are edited with pdisk(8).  The most
		common operation, and the example presented here, deals
		with the conversion of an existing partition into one usable
		by OpenBSD.

		Before editing, the partition table may look like the
		following:

	 #:                type name             length   base    ( size )
	 1: Apple_partition_map Apple                63 @ 1
	 2:      Apple_Driver43*Macintosh            54 @ 64
	 3:      Apple_Driver43*Macintosh            74 @ 118
	 4:    Apple_Driver_ATA*Macintosh            54 @ 192
	 5:    Apple_Driver_ATA*Macintosh            74 @ 246
	 6:      Apple_FWDriver Macintosh           200 @ 320
	 7:  Apple_Driver_IOKit Macintosh           512 @ 520
	 8:       Apple_Patches Patch Partition     512 @ 1032
	 9:           Apple_HFS untitled        2142310 @ 1544    (  1.0G)
	10:           Apple_HFS untitled 2      4120589 @ 2143854 (  2.0G)
	11:              Unused untitled 3      6330517 @ 6264443 (  3.0G)

		After editing the table, it should look like:

	 #:                type name             length   base    ( size )
	 1: Apple_partition_map Apple                63 @ 1
	 2:      Apple_Driver43*Macintosh            54 @ 64
	 3:      Apple_Driver43*Macintosh            74 @ 118
	 4:    Apple_Driver_ATA*Macintosh            54 @ 192
	 5:    Apple_Driver_ATA*Macintosh            74 @ 246
	 6:      Apple_FWDriver Macintosh           200 @ 320
	 7:  Apple_Driver_IOKit Macintosh           512 @ 520
	 8:       Apple_Patches Patch Partition     512 @ 1032
	 9:           Apple_HFS untitled        2142310 @ 1544    (  1.0G)
	10:           Apple_HFS untitled 2      4120589 @ 2143854 (  2.0G)
	11:             OpenBSD OpenBSD         6330517 @ 6264443 (  3.0G)

		This will likely be different based on the number of
		partitions created on the disk by the Apple partition editor.
		It is _VERY_ important to not change the start, sizes, or
		types of partitions other than the ones that are to be used
		by OpenBSD, including the Apple_Driver.* and
		Apple_partition_map.

	MBR partitioning:

dnl What follows is the same text as OpenBSDInstallMBRPart2, but
dnl indented one tab to the right.

dnl places.
dnl XXX This document really should be converted to mdoc...
		The installation program will ask you if you want to use
		the whole disk for OpenBSD.  If you don't need to or don't
		intend to share the disk with other operating systems,
		answer `y' here.  The installation program will then create
		a single MBR partition spanning the whole disk, dedicated
		to OpenBSD.

		Otherwise, fdisk(8) will be invoked to let you to edit
		your MBR partitioning.  The current MBR partitions defined
		will be displayed and you will be allowed to modify them,
		add new partitions, and change which partition to boot from
		by default.

		After your OpenBSD MBR partition has been set up, the real
		partition setup can follow.

OpenBSDInstallPart5({:-
	If you have DOS or Linux partitions defined on the disk, these
	will usually show up as partition 'i', 'j' and so on.-:})

	If you chose to use HFS partitioning to share the disk with MacOS,
	OpenBSD will be unable to install the bootloader into the HFS(+)
	partition to boot OpenBSD; it will be necessary to copy 'ofwboot'
	from the installation media into the first HFS(+) partition using
	Mac OS or Mac OS X.
	If the disk is partitioned using MBR, the bootloader will be
	automatically installed if you set up a small (a few MB) MSDOS
	partition as position `i' in the label.
