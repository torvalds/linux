There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk.  The easiest way,
should your computer support it, is to boot off the OpenBSD CD-ROM,
USB key, or off one of the bootable CD-ROM mini images.  Otherwise, you
can boot from a 3.5" 1.44MB floppy disk if your machine has a floppy drive.
If your machine supports PXE network boots, you could try to configure a
server for a network install.

	If you are using CD-ROM, USB key or floppy media, ensure the media is
	present before starting.

	Reboot the computer to begin the install.  You might have to play
	with your BIOS options to get the computer to boot from the
	correct installation media (floppy, CD, USB key or network/PXE)	rather
	than from the hard disk.

	If you are installing across the network with PXE, you will need
	to tell pxeboot to get the bsd.rd install kernel:

	    boot> boot bsd.rd

	It can take a while to load the kernel from a floppy, slow speed
	CD-ROM drive, or across a network, most likely more than a minute.
	If some action doesn't eventually happen, or the spinning cursor
	has stopped and nothing further has happened, either your boot
	floppy is bad or you are having hardware problems. If trying
	another floppy disk doesn't help, OpenBSD probably can't be run on
	your hardware.  This can probably be considered a bug, so you might
	want to report it.  If you do, please {:-include-:} as many details
	about your system configuration as you can.
