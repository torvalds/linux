=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<ciphers> command converts textual OpenSSL cipher lists into ordered
SSL cipher preference lists. It can be used as a test tool to determine
the appropriate cipherlist.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Print a usage message.

=item B<-s>

Only list supported ciphers: those consistent with the security level, and
minimum and maximum protocol version.  This is closer to the actual cipher list
an application will support.

PSK and SRP ciphers are not enabled by default: they require B<-psk> or B<-srp>
to enable them.

It also does not change the default list of supported signature algorithms.

On a server the list of supported ciphers might also exclude other ciphers
depending on the configured certificates and presence of DH parameters.

If this option is not used then all ciphers that match the cipherlist will be
listed.

=item B<-psk>

When combined with B<-s> includes cipher suites which require PSK.

=item B<-srp>

When combined with B<-s> includes cipher suites which require SRP.

=item B<-v>

Verbose output: For each cipher suite, list details as provided by
L<SSL_CIPHER_description(3)>.

=item B<-V>

Like B<-v>, but include the official cipher suite values in hex.

=item B<-tls1_3>, B<-tls1_2>, B<-tls1_1>, B<-tls1>, B<-ssl3>

In combination with the B<-s> option, list the ciphers which could be used if
the specified protocol were negotiated.
Note that not all protocols and flags may be available, depending on how
OpenSSL was built.

=item B<-stdname>

Precede each cipher suite by its standard name.

=item B<-convert name>

Convert a standard cipher B<name> to its OpenSSL name.

=item B<-ciphersuites val>

Sets the list of TLSv1.3 ciphersuites. This list will be combined with any
TLSv1.2 and below ciphersuites that have been configured. The format for this
list is a simple colon (":") separated list of TLSv1.3 ciphersuite names. By
default this value is:

 TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

=item B<cipherlist>

A cipher list of TLSv1.2 and below ciphersuites to convert to a cipher
preference list. This list will be combined with any TLSv1.3 ciphersuites that
have been configured. If it is not included then the default cipher list will be
used. The format is described below.

=back

=head1 CIPHER LIST FORMAT

The cipher list consists of one or more I<cipher strings> separated by colons.
Commas or spaces are also acceptable separators but colons are normally used.

The actual cipher string can take several different forms.

It can consist of a single cipher suite such as B<RC4-SHA>.

It can represent a list of cipher suites containing a certain algorithm, or
cipher suites of a certain type. For example B<SHA1> represents all ciphers
suites using the digest algorithm SHA1 and B<SSLv3> represents all SSL v3
algorithms.

Lists of cipher suites can be combined in a single cipher string using the
B<+> character. This is used as a logical B<and> operation. For example
B<SHA1+DES> represents all cipher suites containing the SHA1 B<and> the DES
algorithms.

Each cipher string can be optionally preceded by the characters B<!>,
B<-> or B<+>.

If B<!> is used then the ciphers are permanently deleted from the list.
The ciphers deleted can never reappear in the list even if they are
explicitly stated.

If B<-> is used then the ciphers are deleted from the list, but some or
all of the ciphers can be added again by later options.

If B<+> is used then the ciphers are moved to the end of the list. This
option doesn't add any new ciphers it just moves matching existing ones.

If none of these characters is present then the string is just interpreted
as a list of ciphers to be appended to the current preference list. If the
list includes any ciphers already present they will be ignored: that is they
will not moved to the end of the list.

The cipher string B<@STRENGTH> can be used at any point to sort the current
cipher list in order of encryption algorithm key length.

The cipher string B<@SECLEVEL=n> can be used at any point to set the security
level to B<n>, which should be a number between zero and five, inclusive.
See L<SSL_CTX_set_security_level> for a description of what each level means.

The cipher list can be prefixed with the B<DEFAULT> keyword, which enables
the default cipher list as defined below.  Unlike cipher strings,
this prefix may not be combined with other strings using B<+> character.
For example, B<DEFAULT+DES> is not valid.

The content of the default list is determined at compile time and normally
corresponds to B<ALL:!COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT:!eNULL>.

=head1 CIPHER STRINGS

The following is a list of all permitted cipher strings and their meanings.

=over 4

=item B<COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT>

The ciphers included in B<ALL>, but not enabled by default. Currently
this includes all RC4 and anonymous ciphers. Note that this rule does
not cover B<eNULL>, which is not included by B<ALL> (use B<COMPLEMENTOFALL> if
necessary). Note that RC4 based cipher suites are not built into OpenSSL by
default (see the enable-weak-ssl-ciphers option to Configure).

=item B<ALL>

All cipher suites except the B<eNULL> ciphers (which must be explicitly enabled
if needed).
As of OpenSSL 1.0.0, the B<ALL> cipher suites are sensibly ordered by default.

=item B<COMPLEMENTOFALL>

The cipher suites not enabled by B<ALL>, currently B<eNULL>.

=item B<HIGH>

"High" encryption cipher suites. This currently means those with key lengths
larger than 128 bits, and some cipher suites with 128-bit keys.

=item B<MEDIUM>

"Medium" encryption cipher suites, currently some of those using 128 bit
encryption.

=item B<LOW>

"Low" encryption cipher suites, currently those using 64 or 56 bit
encryption algorithms but excluding export cipher suites.  All these
cipher suites have been removed as of OpenSSL 1.1.0.

=item B<eNULL>, B<NULL>

The "NULL" ciphers that is those offering no encryption. Because these offer no
encryption at all and are a security risk they are not enabled via either the
B<DEFAULT> or B<ALL> cipher strings.
Be careful when building cipherlists out of lower-level primitives such as
B<kRSA> or B<aECDSA> as these do overlap with the B<eNULL> ciphers.  When in
doubt, include B<!eNULL> in your cipherlist.

=item B<aNULL>

The cipher suites offering no authentication. This is currently the anonymous
DH algorithms and anonymous ECDH algorithms. These cipher suites are vulnerable
to "man in the middle" attacks and so their use is discouraged.
These are excluded from the B<DEFAULT> ciphers, but included in the B<ALL>
ciphers.
Be careful when building cipherlists out of lower-level primitives such as
B<kDHE> or B<AES> as these do overlap with the B<aNULL> ciphers.
When in doubt, include B<!aNULL> in your cipherlist.

=item B<kRSA>, B<aRSA>, B<RSA>

Cipher suites using RSA key exchange or authentication. B<RSA> is an alias for
B<kRSA>.

=item B<kDHr>, B<kDHd>, B<kDH>

Cipher suites using static DH key agreement and DH certificates signed by CAs
with RSA and DSS keys or either respectively.
All these cipher suites have been removed in OpenSSL 1.1.0.

=item B<kDHE>, B<kEDH>, B<DH>

Cipher suites using ephemeral DH key agreement, including anonymous cipher
suites.

=item B<DHE>, B<EDH>

Cipher suites using authenticated ephemeral DH key agreement.

=item B<ADH>

Anonymous DH cipher suites, note that this does not include anonymous Elliptic
Curve DH (ECDH) cipher suites.

=item B<kEECDH>, B<kECDHE>, B<ECDH>

Cipher suites using ephemeral ECDH key agreement, including anonymous
cipher suites.

=item B<ECDHE>, B<EECDH>

Cipher suites using authenticated ephemeral ECDH key agreement.

=item B<AECDH>

Anonymous Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman cipher suites.

=item B<aDSS>, B<DSS>

Cipher suites using DSS authentication, i.e. the certificates carry DSS keys.

=item B<aDH>

Cipher suites effectively using DH authentication, i.e. the certificates carry
DH keys.
All these cipher suites have been removed in OpenSSL 1.1.0.

=item B<aECDSA>, B<ECDSA>

Cipher suites using ECDSA authentication, i.e. the certificates carry ECDSA
keys.

=item B<TLSv1.2>, B<TLSv1.0>, B<SSLv3>

Lists cipher suites which are only supported in at least TLS v1.2, TLS v1.0 or
SSL v3.0 respectively.
Note: there are no cipher suites specific to TLS v1.1.
Since this is only the minimum version, if, for example, TLSv1.0 is negotiated
then both TLSv1.0 and SSLv3.0 cipher suites are available.

Note: these cipher strings B<do not> change the negotiated version of SSL or
TLS, they only affect the list of available cipher suites.

=item B<AES128>, B<AES256>, B<AES>

cipher suites using 128 bit AES, 256 bit AES or either 128 or 256 bit AES.

=item B<AESGCM>

AES in Galois Counter Mode (GCM): these cipher suites are only supported
in TLS v1.2.

=item B<AESCCM>, B<AESCCM8>

AES in Cipher Block Chaining - Message Authentication Mode (CCM): these
cipher suites are only supported in TLS v1.2. B<AESCCM> references CCM
cipher suites using both 16 and 8 octet Integrity Check Value (ICV)
while B<AESCCM8> only references 8 octet ICV.

=item B<ARIA128>, B<ARIA256>, B<ARIA>

Cipher suites using 128 bit ARIA, 256 bit ARIA or either 128 or 256 bit
ARIA.

=item B<CAMELLIA128>, B<CAMELLIA256>, B<CAMELLIA>

Cipher suites using 128 bit CAMELLIA, 256 bit CAMELLIA or either 128 or 256 bit
CAMELLIA.

=item B<CHACHA20>

Cipher suites using ChaCha20.

=item B<3DES>

Cipher suites using triple DES.

=item B<DES>

Cipher suites using DES (not triple DES).
All these cipher suites have been removed in OpenSSL 1.1.0.

=item B<RC4>

Cipher suites using RC4.

=item B<RC2>

Cipher suites using RC2.

=item B<IDEA>

Cipher suites using IDEA.

=item B<SEED>

Cipher suites using SEED.

=item B<MD5>

Cipher suites using MD5.

=item B<SHA1>, B<SHA>

Cipher suites using SHA1.

=item B<SHA256>, B<SHA384>

Cipher suites using SHA256 or SHA384.

=item B<aGOST>

Cipher suites using GOST R 34.10 (either 2001 or 94) for authentication
(needs an engine supporting GOST algorithms).

=item B<aGOST01>

Cipher suites using GOST R 34.10-2001 authentication.

=item B<kGOST>

Cipher suites, using VKO 34.10 key exchange, specified in the RFC 4357.

=item B<GOST94>

Cipher suites, using HMAC based on GOST R 34.11-94.

=item B<GOST89MAC>

Cipher suites using GOST 28147-89 MAC B<instead of> HMAC.

=item B<PSK>

All cipher suites using pre-shared keys (PSK).

=item B<kPSK>, B<kECDHEPSK>, B<kDHEPSK>, B<kRSAPSK>

Cipher suites using PSK key exchange, ECDHE_PSK, DHE_PSK or RSA_PSK.

=item B<aPSK>

Cipher suites using PSK authentication (currently all PSK modes apart from
RSA_PSK).

=item B<SUITEB128>, B<SUITEB128ONLY>, B<SUITEB192>

Enables suite B mode of operation using 128 (permitting 192 bit mode by peer)
128 bit (not permitting 192 bit by peer) or 192 bit level of security
respectively.
If used these cipherstrings should appear first in the cipher
list and anything after them is ignored.
Setting Suite B mode has additional consequences required to comply with
RFC6460.
In particular the supported signature algorithms is reduced to support only
ECDSA and SHA256 or SHA384, only the elliptic curves P-256 and P-384 can be
used and only the two suite B compliant cipher suites
(ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 and ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384) are
permissible.

=head1 CIPHER SUITE NAMES

The following lists give the SSL or TLS cipher suites names from the
relevant specification and their OpenSSL equivalents. It should be noted,
that several cipher suite names do not include the authentication used,
e.g. DES-CBC3-SHA. In these cases, RSA authentication is used.

=head2 Older names used by OpenSSL

The following names are accepted by older releases:

 SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA    EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA (DHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA)
 SSL_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA    EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA (DHE-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA)

=head1 NOTES

Some compiled versions of OpenSSL may not include all the ciphers
listed here because some ciphers were excluded at compile time.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Verbose listing of all OpenSSL ciphers including NULL ciphers:

 openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:eNULL'

Include all ciphers except NULL and anonymous DH then sort by
strength:

 openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:!ADH:@STRENGTH'

Include all ciphers except ones with no encryption (eNULL) or no
authentication (aNULL):

 openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:!aNULL'

Include only 3DES ciphers and then place RSA ciphers last:

 openssl ciphers -v '3DES:+RSA'

Include all RC4 ciphers but leave out those without authentication:

 openssl ciphers -v 'RC4:!COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT'

Include all ciphers with RSA authentication but leave out ciphers without
encryption.

 openssl ciphers -v 'RSA:!COMPLEMENTOFALL'

Set security level to 2 and display all ciphers consistent with level 2:

 openssl ciphers -s -v 'ALL:@SECLEVEL=2'

=head1 HISTORY

The B<-V> option for the B<ciphers> command was added in OpenSSL 1.0.0.

The B<-stdname> is only available if OpenSSL is built with tracing enabled
(B<enable-ssl-trace> argument to Configure) before OpenSSL 1.1.1.

The B<-convert> option was added in OpenSSL 1.1.1.
