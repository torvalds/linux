=head1 NAME

ct - Certificate Transparency

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ct.h>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library implements Certificate Transparency (CT) verification for TLS
clients, as defined in RFC 6962. This verification can provide some confidence
that a certificate has been publicly logged in a set of CT logs.

By default, these checks are disabled. They can be enabled using
L<SSL_CTX_enable_ct(3)> or L<SSL_enable_ct(3)>.

This library can also be used to parse and examine CT data structures, such as
Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs), or to read a list of CT logs. There are
functions for:
- decoding and encoding SCTs in DER and TLS wire format.
- printing SCTs.
- verifying the authenticity of SCTs.
- loading a CT log list from a CONF file.
