=head1 DESCRIPTION

BN_bn2bin() converts the absolute value of B<a> into big-endian form
and stores it at B<to>. B<to> must point to BN_num_bytes(B<a>) bytes of
memory.

BN_bn2binpad() also converts the absolute value of B<a> into big-endian form
and stores it at B<to>. B<tolen> indicates the length of the output buffer
B<to>. The result is padded with zeroes if necessary. If B<tolen> is less than
BN_num_bytes(B<a>) an error is returned.

BN_bin2bn() converts the positive integer in big-endian form of length
B<len> at B<s> into a B<BIGNUM> and places it in B<ret>. If B<ret> is
NULL, a new B<BIGNUM> is created.

BN_bn2lebinpad() and BN_lebin2bn() are identical to BN_bn2binpad() and
BN_bin2bn() except the buffer is in little-endian format.

BN_bn2hex() and BN_bn2dec() return printable strings containing the
hexadecimal and decimal encoding of B<a> respectively. For negative
numbers, the string is prefaced with a leading '-'. The string must be
freed later using OPENSSL_free().

BN_hex2bn() takes as many characters as possible from the string B<str>,
including the leading character '-' which means negative, to form a valid
hexadecimal number representation and converts them to a B<BIGNUM> and
stores it in **B<a>. If *B<a> is NULL, a new B<BIGNUM> is created. If
B<a> is NULL, it only computes the length of valid representation.
A "negative zero" is converted to zero.
BN_dec2bn() is the same using the decimal system.

BN_print() and BN_print_fp() write the hexadecimal encoding of B<a>,
with a leading '-' for negative numbers, to the B<BIO> or B<FILE>
B<fp>.

BN_bn2mpi() and BN_mpi2bn() convert B<BIGNUM>s from and to a format
that consists of the number's length in bytes represented as a 4-byte
big-endian number, and the number itself in big-endian format, where
the most significant bit signals a negative number (the representation
of numbers with the MSB set is prefixed with null byte).

BN_bn2mpi() stores the representation of B<a> at B<to>, where B<to>
must be large enough to hold the result. The size can be determined by
calling BN_bn2mpi(B<a>, NULL).

BN_mpi2bn() converts the B<len> bytes long representation at B<s> to
a B<BIGNUM> and stores it at B<ret>, or in a newly allocated B<BIGNUM>
if B<ret> is NULL.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

BN_bn2bin() returns the length of the big-endian number placed at B<to>.
BN_bin2bn() returns the B<BIGNUM>, NULL on error.

BN_bn2binpad() returns the number of bytes written or -1 if the supplied
buffer is too small.

BN_bn2hex() and BN_bn2dec() return a null-terminated string, or NULL
on error. BN_hex2bn() and BN_dec2bn() return the number of characters
used in parsing, or 0 on error, in which
case no new B<BIGNUM> will be created.

BN_print_fp() and BN_print() return 1 on success, 0 on write errors.

BN_bn2mpi() returns the length of the representation. BN_mpi2bn()
returns the B<BIGNUM>, and NULL on error.

The error codes can be obtained by L<ERR_get_error(3)>.
