=head1 NAME

CTLOG_STORE_get0_log_by_id -
Get a Certificate Transparency log from a CTLOG_STORE

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ct.h>

 const CTLOG *CTLOG_STORE_get0_log_by_id(const CTLOG_STORE *store,
                                         const uint8_t *log_id,
                                         size_t log_id_len);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) identifies the Certificate Transparency
(CT) log that issued it using the log's LogID (see RFC 6962, Section 3.2).
Therefore, it is useful to be able to look up more information about a log
(e.g. its public key) using this LogID.

CTLOG_STORE_get0_log_by_id() provides a way to do this. It will find a CTLOG
in a CTLOG_STORE that has a given LogID.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

B<CTLOG_STORE_get0_log_by_id> returns a CTLOG with the given LogID, if it
exists in the given CTLOG_STORE, otherwise it returns NULL.
