=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_CTX_sess_number() returns the current number of sessions in the internal
session cache.

SSL_CTX_sess_connect() returns the number of started SSL/TLS handshakes in
client mode.

SSL_CTX_sess_connect_good() returns the number of successfully established
SSL/TLS sessions in client mode.

SSL_CTX_sess_connect_renegotiate() returns the number of started renegotiations
in client mode.

SSL_CTX_sess_accept() returns the number of started SSL/TLS handshakes in
server mode.

SSL_CTX_sess_accept_good() returns the number of successfully established
SSL/TLS sessions in server mode.

SSL_CTX_sess_accept_renegotiate() returns the number of started renegotiations
in server mode.

SSL_CTX_sess_hits() returns the number of successfully reused sessions.
In client mode a session set with L<SSL_set_session(3)>
successfully reused is counted as a hit. In server mode a session successfully
retrieved from internal or external cache is counted as a hit.

SSL_CTX_sess_cb_hits() returns the number of successfully retrieved sessions
from the external session cache in server mode.

SSL_CTX_sess_misses() returns the number of sessions proposed by clients
that were not found in the internal session cache in server mode.

SSL_CTX_sess_timeouts() returns the number of sessions proposed by clients
and either found in the internal or external session cache in server mode,
 but that were invalid due to timeout. These sessions are not included in
the SSL_CTX_sess_hits() count.

SSL_CTX_sess_cache_full() returns the number of sessions that were removed
because the maximum session cache size was exceeded.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The functions return the values indicated in the DESCRIPTION section.
