=head1 NAME

SSL_get0_peer_scts - get SCTs received

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 const STACK_OF(SCT) *SSL_get0_peer_scts(SSL *s);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_get0_peer_scts() returns the signed certificate timestamps (SCTs) that have
been received. If this is the first time that this function has been called for
a given B<SSL> instance, it will examine the TLS extensions, OCSP response and
the peer's certificate for SCTs. Future calls will return the same SCTs.

=head1 RESTRICTIONS

If no Certificate Transparency validation callback has been set (using
B<SSL_CTX_set_ct_validation_callback> or B<SSL_set_ct_validation_callback>),
this function is not guaranteed to return all of the SCTs that the peer is
capable of sending.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_get0_peer_scts() returns a list of SCTs found, or NULL if an error occurs.
