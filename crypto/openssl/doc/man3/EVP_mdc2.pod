=head1 NAME

EVP_mdc2
- MDC-2 For EVP

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 const EVP_MD *EVP_mdc2(void);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MDC-2 (Modification Detection Code 2 or Meyer-Schilling) is a cryptographic
hash function based on a block cipher.

=over 4

=item EVP_mdc2()

The MDC-2DES algorithm of using MDC-2 with the DES block cipher. It produces a
128-bit output from a given input.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

These functions return a B<EVP_MD> structure that contains the
implementation of the symmetric cipher. See L<EVP_MD_meth_new(3)> for
details of the B<EVP_MD> structure.

=head1 CONFORMING TO

ISO/IEC 10118-2:2000 Hash-Function 2, with DES as the underlying block cipher.
