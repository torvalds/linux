=head1 NAME

EVP_blake2b512,
EVP_blake2s256
- BLAKE2 For EVP

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 const EVP_MD *EVP_blake2b512(void);
 const EVP_MD *EVP_blake2s256(void);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

BLAKE2 is an improved version of BLAKE, which was submitted to the NIST SHA-3
algorithm competition. The BLAKE2s and BLAKE2b algorithms are described in
RFC 7693.

=over 4

=item EVP_blake2s256()

The BLAKE2s algorithm that produces a 256-bit output from a given input.

=item EVP_blake2b512()

The BLAKE2b algorithm that produces a 512-bit output from a given input.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

These functions return a B<EVP_MD> structure that contains the
implementation of the symmetric cipher. See L<EVP_MD_meth_new(3)> for
details of the B<EVP_MD> structure.

=head1 CONFORMING TO

RFC 7693.

=head1 NOTES

While the BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s algorithms supports a variable length digest,
this implementation outputs a digest of a fixed length (the maximum length
supported), which is 512-bits for BLAKE2b and 256-bits for BLAKE2s.
