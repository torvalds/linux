=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc2_cbc(void)
 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc2_cfb(void)
 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc2_cfb64(void)
 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc2_ecb(void)
 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc2_ofb(void)
 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc2_40_cbc(void)
 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc2_64_cbc(void)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The RC2 encryption algorithm for EVP.

=over 4

=item EVP_rc2_cbc(),
EVP_rc2_cfb(),
EVP_rc2_cfb64(),
EVP_rc2_ecb(),
EVP_rc2_ofb()

RC2 encryption algorithm in CBC, CFB, ECB and OFB modes respectively. This is a
variable key length cipher with an additional parameter called "effective key
bits" or "effective key length". By default both are set to 128 bits.

=item EVP_rc2_40_cbc(),
EVP_rc2_64_cbc()

RC2 algorithm in CBC mode with a default key length and effective key length of
40 and 64 bits.

WARNING: these functions are obsolete. Their usage should be replaced with the
EVP_rc2_cbc(), EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_key_length() and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_ctrl()
functions to set the key length and effective key length.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

These functions return an B<EVP_CIPHER> structure that contains the
implementation of the symmetric cipher. See L<EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3)> for
details of the B<EVP_CIPHER> structure.
