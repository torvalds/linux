=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<X509_STORE> structure is intended to be a consolidated mechanism for
holding information about X.509 certificates and CRLs, and constructing
and validating chains of certificates terminating in trusted roots.
It admits multiple lookup mechanisms and efficient scaling performance
with large numbers of certificates, and a great deal of flexibility in
how validation and policy checks are performed.

L<X509_STORE_new(3)> creates an empty B<X509_STORE> structure, which contains
no information about trusted certificates or where such certificates
are located on disk, and is generally not usable.  Normally, trusted
certificates will be added to the B<X509_STORE> to prepare it for use,
via mechanisms such as X509_STORE_add_lookup() and X509_LOOKUP_file(), or
PEM_read_bio_X509_AUX() and X509_STORE_add_cert().  CRLs can also be added,
and many behaviors configured as desired.

Once the B<X509_STORE> is suitably configured, X509_STORE_CTX_new() is
used to instantiate a single-use B<X509_STORE_CTX> for each chain-building
and verification operation.  That process includes providing the end-entity
certificate to be verified and an additional set of untrusted certificates
that may be used in chain-building.  As such, it is expected that the
certificates included in the B<X509_STORE> are certificates that represent
trusted entities such as root certificate authorities (CAs).
OpenSSL represents these trusted certificates internally as B<X509> objects
with an associated B<X509_CERT_AUX>, as are produced by
PEM_read_bio_X509_AUX() and similar routines that refer to X509_AUX.
The public interfaces that operate on such trusted certificates still
operate on pointers to B<X509> objects, though.

X509_STORE_add_cert() and X509_STORE_add_crl() add the respective object
to the B<X509_STORE>'s local storage.  Untrusted objects should not be
added in this way.

X509_STORE_set_depth(), X509_STORE_set_flags(), X509_STORE_set_purpose(),
X509_STORE_set_trust(), and X509_STORE_set1_param() set the default values
for the corresponding values used in certificate chain validation.  Their
behavior is documented in the corresponding B<X509_VERIFY_PARAM> manual
pages, e.g., L<X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_depth(3)>.

X509_STORE_load_locations() loads trusted certificate(s) into an
B<X509_STORE> from a given file and/or directory path.  It is permitted
to specify just a file, just a directory, or both paths.  The certificates
in the directory must be in hashed form, as documented in
L<X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir(3)>.

X509_STORE_set_default_paths() is somewhat misnamed, in that it does not
set what default paths should be used for loading certificates.  Instead,
it loads certificates into the B<X509_STORE> from the hardcoded default
paths.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

X509_STORE_add_cert(), X509_STORE_add_crl(), X509_STORE_set_depth(),
X509_STORE_set_flags(), X509_STORE_set_purpose(),
X509_STORE_set_trust(), X509_STORE_load_locations(), and
X509_STORE_set_default_paths() return 1 on success or 0 on failure.
