=head1 NAME

EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_pss_keygen_md,
EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_pss_keygen_mgf1_md,
EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_pss_keygen_saltlen
- EVP_PKEY RSA-PSS algorithm support functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/rsa.h>

 int EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_pss_keygen_md(EVP_PKEY_CTX *pctx,
                                        const EVP_MD *md);
 int EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_pss_keygen_mgf1_md(EVP_PKEY_CTX *pctx,
                                             const EVP_MD *md);
 int EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_pss_keygen_saltlen(EVP_PKEY_CTX *pctx,
                                             int saltlen);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the functions that implement L<RSA-PSS(7)>.

=head2 Signing and Verification

The macro EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_padding() is supported but an error is
returned if an attempt is made to set the padding mode to anything other
than B<PSS>. It is otherwise similar to the B<RSA> version.

The EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_pss_saltlen() macro is used to set the salt length.
If the key has usage restrictions then an error is returned if an attempt is
made to set the salt length below the minimum value. It is otherwise similar
to the B<RSA> operation except detection of the salt length (using
RSA_PSS_SALTLEN_AUTO) is not supported for verification if the key has
usage restrictions.

The EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_signature_md() and EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_mgf1_md() macros
are used to set the digest and MGF1 algorithms respectively. If the key has
usage restrictions then an error is returned if an attempt is made to set the
digest to anything other than the restricted value. Otherwise these are
similar to the B<RSA> versions.

=head2 Key Generation

As with RSA key generation the EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_keygen_bits()
and EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_keygen_pubexp() macros are supported for RSA-PSS:
they have exactly the same meaning as for the RSA algorithm.

Optional parameter restrictions can be specified when generating a PSS key.
If any restrictions are set (using the macros described below) then B<all>
parameters are restricted. For example, setting a minimum salt length also
restricts the digest and MGF1 algorithms. If any restrictions are in place
then they are reflected in the corresponding parameters of the public key
when (for example) a certificate request is signed.

EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_pss_keygen_md() restricts the digest algorithm the
generated key can use to B<md>.

EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_pss_keygen_mgf1_md() restricts the MGF1 algorithm the
generated key can use to B<md>.

EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_pss_keygen_saltlen() restricts the minimum salt length
to B<saltlen>.

=head1 NOTES

A context for the B<RSA-PSS> algorithm can be obtained by calling:

 EVP_PKEY_CTX *pctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id(EVP_PKEY_RSA_PSS, NULL);

=head1 RETURN VALUES

All these functions return 1 for success and 0 or a negative value for failure.
In particular a return value of -2 indicates the operation is not supported by
the public key algorithm.
