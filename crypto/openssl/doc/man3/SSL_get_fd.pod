=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 int SSL_get_fd(const SSL *ssl);
 int SSL_get_rfd(const SSL *ssl);
 int SSL_get_wfd(const SSL *ssl);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_get_fd() returns the file descriptor which is linked to B<ssl>.
SSL_get_rfd() and SSL_get_wfd() return the file descriptors for the
read or the write channel, which can be different. If the read and the
write channel are different, SSL_get_fd() will return the file descriptor
of the read channel.

=over 4

=item -1

The operation failed, because the underlying BIO is not of the correct type
(suitable for file descriptors).

=item E<gt>=0
