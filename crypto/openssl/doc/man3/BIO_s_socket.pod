=head1 NAME

BIO_s_socket, BIO_new_socket - socket BIO

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/bio.h>

 const BIO_METHOD *BIO_s_socket(void);

 BIO *BIO_new_socket(int sock, int close_flag);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

BIO_s_socket() returns the socket BIO method. This is a wrapper
round the platform's socket routines.

BIO_read_ex() and BIO_write_ex() read or write the underlying socket.
BIO_puts() is supported but BIO_gets() is not.

If the close flag is set then the socket is shut down and closed
when the BIO is freed.

BIO_new_socket() returns a socket BIO using B<sock> and B<close_flag>.

=head1 NOTES

Socket BIOs also support any relevant functionality of file descriptor
BIOs.

The reason for having separate file descriptor and socket BIOs is that on some
platforms sockets are not file descriptors and use distinct I/O routines,
Windows is one such platform. Any code mixing the two will not work on
all platforms.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

BIO_s_socket() returns the socket BIO method.

BIO_new_socket() returns the newly allocated BIO or NULL is an error
occurred.
