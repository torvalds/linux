=head1 NAME

o2i_SCT_LIST, i2o_SCT_LIST, o2i_SCT, i2o_SCT -
decode and encode Signed Certificate Timestamp lists in TLS wire format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ct.h>

 STACK_OF(SCT) *o2i_SCT_LIST(STACK_OF(SCT) **a, const unsigned char **pp,
                             size_t len);
 int i2o_SCT_LIST(const STACK_OF(SCT) *a, unsigned char **pp);
 SCT *o2i_SCT(SCT **psct, const unsigned char **in, size_t len);
 int i2o_SCT(const SCT *sct, unsigned char **out);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The SCT_LIST and SCT functions are very similar to the i2d and d2i family of
functions, except that they convert to and from TLS wire format, as described in
RFC 6962. See L<d2i_SCT_LIST> for more information about how the parameters are
treated and the return values.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

All of the functions have return values consistent with those stated for
L<d2i_SCT_LIST> and L<i2d_SCT_LIST>.

=head1 HISTORY

These functions were added in OpenSSL 1.1.0.
