=head1 NAME

EVP_md5,
EVP_md5_sha1
- MD5 For EVP

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 const EVP_MD *EVP_md5(void);
 const EVP_MD *EVP_md5_sha1(void);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MD5 is a cryptographic hash function standardized in RFC 1321 and designed by
Ronald Rivest.

The CMU Software Engineering Institute considers MD5 unsuitable for further
use since its security has been severely compromised.

=item EVP_md5()

The MD5 algorithm which produces a 128-bit output from a given input.

=item EVP_md5_sha1()

A hash algorithm of SSL v3 that combines MD5 with SHA-1 as decirbed in RFC
6101.

WARNING: this algorithm is not intended for non-SSL usage.
