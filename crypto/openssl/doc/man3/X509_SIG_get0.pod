=head1 NAME

X509_SIG_get0, X509_SIG_getm - DigestInfo functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509.h>

 void X509_SIG_get0(const X509_SIG *sig, const X509_ALGOR **palg,
                    const ASN1_OCTET_STRING **pdigest);
 void X509_SIG_getm(X509_SIG *sig, X509_ALGOR **palg,
                    ASN1_OCTET_STRING **pdigest,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

X509_SIG_get0() returns pointers to the algorithm identifier and digest
value in B<sig>. X509_SIG_getm() is identical to X509_SIG_get0()
except the pointers returned are not constant and can be modified:
for example to initialise them.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

X509_SIG_get0() and X509_SIG_getm() return no values.
