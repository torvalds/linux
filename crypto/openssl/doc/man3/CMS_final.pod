=head1 NAME

CMS_final - finalise a CMS_ContentInfo structure

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/cms.h>

 int CMS_final(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, BIO *data, BIO *dcont, unsigned int flags);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CMS_final() finalises the structure B<cms>. It's purpose is to perform any
operations necessary on B<cms> (digest computation for example) and set the
appropriate fields. The parameter B<data> contains the content to be
processed. The B<dcont> parameter contains a BIO to write content to after
processing: this is only used with detached data and will usually be set to
NULL.

=head1 NOTES

This function will normally be called when the B<CMS_PARTIAL> flag is used. It
should only be used when streaming is not performed because the streaming
I/O functions perform finalisation operations internally.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

CMS_final() returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.
