=head1 NAME

SSL_get_peer_certificate - get the X509 certificate of the peer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 X509 *SSL_get_peer_certificate(const SSL *ssl);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_get_peer_certificate() returns a pointer to the X509 certificate the
peer presented. If the peer did not present a certificate, NULL is returned.

=head1 NOTES

Due to the protocol definition, a TLS/SSL server will always send a
certificate, if present. A client will only send a certificate when
explicitly requested to do so by the server (see
L<SSL_CTX_set_verify(3)>). If an anonymous cipher
is used, no certificates are sent.

That a certificate is returned does not indicate information about the
verification state, use L<SSL_get_verify_result(3)>
to check the verification state.

The reference count of the X509 object is incremented by one, so that it
will not be destroyed when the session containing the peer certificate is
freed. The X509 object must be explicitly freed using X509_free().

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The following return values can occur:

=over 4

=item NULL

No certificate was presented by the peer or no connection was established.

=item Pointer to an X509 certificate

The return value points to the certificate presented by the peer.
