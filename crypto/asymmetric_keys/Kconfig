	tristate "Asymmetric (public-key cryptographic) key type"
	depends on KEYS
	help
	  This option provides support for a key type that holds the data for
	  the asymmetric keys used for public key cryptographic operations such
	  as encryption, decryption, signature generation and signature
	  verification.

	select CRYPTO_HASH_INFO
	help
	  This option provides support for asymmetric public key type handling.
	  If signature generation and/or verification are to be used,
	  appropriate hash algorithms (such as SHA-1) must be available.
	  ENOPKG will be reported if the requisite algorithm is unavailable.

config PUBLIC_KEY_ALGO_RSA
	tristate "RSA public-key algorithm"
	select MPILIB
	help
	  This option enables support for the RSA algorithm (PKCS#1, RFC3447).

	depends on ASYMMETRIC_PUBLIC_KEY_SUBTYPE
	select ASN1
	select OID_REGISTRY
	help
	  This option procides support for parsing X.509 format blobs for key
	  data and provides the ability to instantiate a crypto key from a
	  public key packet found inside the certificate.
