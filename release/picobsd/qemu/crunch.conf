# Configuration file for "qemu" images..
#
# Depending on your needs, you will almost surely need to
# add/remove/change programs according to your needs.
# Remember that some programs require matching kernel options to
# enable device drivers etc.
#
# To figure out how much space is used by each program, do
#
#	size build_dir-bridge/crunch/*lo
#
# Remember that programs require libraries, which add up to the
# total size. The final binary is build_dir-bridge/mfs.tree/stand/crunch
# and you can check which libraries it uses with
#
#	ldd build_dir-bridge/mfs.tree/stand/crunch

# crunchgen configuration to build the crunched binary, see "man crunchgen"
# We need to specify generic build options, the places where to look
# for sources, and the list of program and libraries we want to put
# in the crunched binary.
#
# NOTE: the string "/usr/src" below will be automatically replaced with
# the path set in the 'build' script.

# Default build options. Basically tell the Makefiles
# that to use the most compact possible version of the code.

# Directories where to look for sources of various binaries.
# @__CWD__@ is a magic keyword in the picobsd's (Makefile.conf)
# which is replaced with the directory with the picobsd configuration
# corresponding to your image. This way you can have custom sources
# in that directory overriding system programs.

srcdirs @__CWD__@/src

# Some programs are especially written for PicoBSD and reside in
# release/picobsd/tinyware.
# Put this entry near the head of the list to override standard binaries.

srcdirs /usr/src/release/picobsd/tinyware

# Other standard locations for sources.
# If a program uses its own source directory, add

srcdirs /usr/src/bin
srcdirs /usr/src/sbin/i386
srcdirs /usr/src/sbin
srcdirs /usr/src/usr.bin
srcdirs /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin
srcdirs /usr/src/usr.sbin
srcdirs /usr/src/libexec

# For programs that reside in different places, the best option
# is to use the command "special XXX srcdir YYY" where XXX is the
# program name and YYY is the directory path.
# "special XXX ..." can be used to specify more options, see again
# the crunchgen manpage.

# init is always necessary (unless you have a replacement, oinit)

# You will also need a shell and a bunch of utilities.
# The standard shell is not that large, but you need many
# external programs. In fact most of them do not take much space
# as they merely issue a system call, and print the result.
# For a more compact version of shell and utilities, you could
# try busybox, however most system management commands in busybox
# will not work as they use linux-specific interfaces.
