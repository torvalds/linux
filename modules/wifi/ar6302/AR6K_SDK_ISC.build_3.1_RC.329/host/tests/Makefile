#   GEN_LIBS - list of libs to be generated ()
#   GEN_IMAGES - list of images to be generated ()
#   COMPONENTS_xxx - a list of libs/objs in the form
#     subdir/lib to be extracted and rolled up into

# Configuration i.e. compile options etc.
# Target specific stuff (defines etc.) goes in here!
# Generally values applying to a tree are captured in the

# Recursion Magic - Don't touch this!!

# Each subtree potentially has an include directory
#   corresponding to the common APIs applicable to modules
#   rooted at that subtree. Accordingly, the INCLUDE PATH
#   of a module can only contain the include directories up
#   its parent path, and not its siblings
#
# Required for each makefile to inherit from the parent
