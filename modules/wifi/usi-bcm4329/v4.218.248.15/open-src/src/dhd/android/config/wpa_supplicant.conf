#########################################################################

# This file describes configuration file format and lists all available option.
# Please also take a look at simpler configuration examples in 'examples'
# subdirectory.
#
# Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored

# NOTE! This file may contain password information and should probably be made
# readable only by root user on multiuser systems.

# Note: All file paths in this configuration file should use full (absolute,
# not relative to working directory) path in order to allow working directory
# to be changed. This can happen if wpa_supplicant is run in the background.

# Whether to allow wpa_supplicant to update (overwrite) configuration
#
# This option can be used to allow wpa_supplicant to overwrite configuration
# file whenever configuration is changed (e.g., new network block is added with
# wpa_cli or wpa_gui, or a password is changed). This is required for
# wpa_cli/wpa_gui to be able to store the configuration changes permanently.
# Please note that overwriting configuration file will remove the comments from
# it.
update_config=1

# global configuration (shared by all network blocks)
#
# Parameters for the control interface. If this is specified, wpa_supplicant
# will open a control interface that is available for external programs to
# manage wpa_supplicant. The meaning of this string depends on which control
# interface mechanism is used. For all cases, the existance of this parameter
# in configuration is used to determine whether the control interface is
# enabled.
#
# For UNIX domain sockets (default on Linux and BSD): This is a directory that
# will be created for UNIX domain sockets for listening to requests from
# external programs (CLI/GUI, etc.) for status information and configuration.
# The socket file will be named based on the interface name, so multiple
# wpa_supplicant processes can be run at the same time if more than one
# interface is used.
# /var/run/wpa_supplicant is the recommended directory for sockets and by
# default, wpa_cli will use it when trying to connect with wpa_supplicant.
#
# Access control for the control interface can be configured by setting the
# directory to allow only members of a group to use sockets. This way, it is
# possible to run wpa_supplicant as root (since it needs to change network
# configuration and open raw sockets) and still allow GUI/CLI components to be
# run as non-root users. However, since the control interface can be used to
# change the network configuration, this access needs to be protected in many
# cases. By default, wpa_supplicant is configured to use gid 0 (root). If you
# want to allow non-root users to use the control interface, add a new group
# and change this value to match with that group. Add users that should have
# control interface access to this group. If this variable is commented out or
# not included in the configuration file, group will not be changed from the
# value it got by default when the directory or socket was created.
#
# When configuring both the directory and group, use following format:
# DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=wheel
# DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=0
# (group can be either group name or gid)
#
# For UDP connections (default on Windows): The value will be ignored. This
# variable is just used to select that the control interface is to be created.
# The value can be set to, e.g., udp (ctrl_interface=udp)
#
# For Windows Named Pipe: This value can be used to set the security descriptor
# for controlling access to the control interface. Security descriptor can be
# set using Security Descriptor String Format (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/
# library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/secauthz/security/
# security_descriptor_string_format.asp). The descriptor string needs to be
# prefixed with SDDL=. For example, ctrl_interface=SDDL=D: would set an empty
# DACL (which will reject all connections). See README-Windows.txt for more
# information about SDDL string format.
#
ctrl_interface=eth0
ctrl_interface_group=wifi

# IEEE 802.1X/EAPOL version
# wpa_supplicant is implemented based on IEEE Std 802.1X-2004 which defines
# EAPOL version 2. However, there are many APs that do not handle the new
# version number correctly (they seem to drop the frames completely). In order
# to make wpa_supplicant interoperate with these APs, the version number is set
# to 1 by default. This configuration value can be used to set it to the new
# version (2).
eapol_version=1

# AP scanning/selection
# By default, wpa_supplicant requests driver to perform AP scanning and then
# uses the scan results to select a suitable AP. Another alternative is to
# allow the driver to take care of AP scanning and selection and use
# wpa_supplicant just to process EAPOL frames based on IEEE 802.11 association
# information from the driver.
# 1: wpa_supplicant initiates scanning and AP selection
# 0: driver takes care of scanning, AP selection, and IEEE 802.11 association
#    parameters (e.g., WPA IE generation); this mode can also be used with
#    non-WPA drivers when using IEEE 802.1X mode; do not try to associate with
#    APs (i.e., external program needs to control association). This mode must
#    also be used when using wired Ethernet drivers.
# 2: like 0, but associate with APs using security policy and SSID (but not
#    BSSID); this can be used, e.g., with ndiswrapper and NDIS drivers to
#    enable operation with hidden SSIDs and optimized roaming; in this mode,
#    the network blocks in the configuration file are tried one by one until
#    the driver reports successful association; each network block should have
#    explicit security policy (i.e., only one option in the lists) for
#    key_mgmt, pairwise, group, proto variables
ap_scan=1

# EAP fast re-authentication
# By default, fast re-authentication is enabled for all EAP methods that
# support it. This variable can be used to disable fast re-authentication.
# Normally, there is no need to disable this.
fast_reauth=1

# OpenSSL Engine support
# These options can be used to load OpenSSL engines.
# The two engines that are supported currently are shown below:
# They are both from the opensc project (http://www.opensc.org/)
# By default no engines are loaded.
# make the opensc engine available
#opensc_engine_path=/usr/lib/opensc/engine_opensc.so
# make the pkcs11 engine available
#pkcs11_engine_path=/usr/lib/opensc/engine_pkcs11.so
# configure the path to the pkcs11 module required by the pkcs11 engine
#pkcs11_module_path=/usr/lib/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.so

# Dynamic EAP methods
# If EAP methods were built dynamically as shared object files, they need to be
# loaded here before being used in the network blocks. By default, EAP methods
# are included statically in the build, so these lines are not needed
#load_dynamic_eap=/usr/lib/wpa_supplicant/eap_tls.so
#load_dynamic_eap=/usr/lib/wpa_supplicant/eap_md5.so

# Driver interface parameters
# This field can be used to configure arbitrary driver interace parameters. The
# format is specific to the selected driver interface. This field is not used
# in most cases.
#driver_param="field=value"

# Maximum lifetime for PMKSA in seconds; default 43200
#dot11RSNAConfigPMKLifetime=43200
# Threshold for reauthentication (percentage of PMK lifetime); default 70
#dot11RSNAConfigPMKReauthThreshold=70
# Timeout for security association negotiation in seconds; default 60
#dot11RSNAConfigSATimeout=60

# network block
#
# Each network (usually AP's sharing the same SSID) is configured as a separate
# block in this configuration file. The network blocks are in preference order
# (the first match is used).
#
# network block fields:
#
# disabled:
#	0 = this network can be used (default)
#	1 = this network block is disabled (can be enabled through ctrl_iface,
#	    e.g., with wpa_cli or wpa_gui)
#
# id_str: Network identifier string for external scripts. This value is passed
#	to external action script through wpa_cli as WPA_ID_STR environment
#	variable to make it easier to do network specific configuration.
#
# ssid: SSID (mandatory); either as an ASCII string with double quotation or
#	as hex string; network name
#
# scan_ssid:
#	0 = do not scan this SSID with specific Probe Request frames (default)
#	1 = scan with SSID-specific Probe Request frames (this can be used to
#	    find APs that do not accept broadcast SSID or use multiple SSIDs;
#	    this will add latency to scanning, so enable this only when needed)
#
# bssid: BSSID (optional); if set, this network block is used only when
#	associating with the AP using the configured BSSID
#
# priority: priority group (integer)
# By default, all networks will get same priority group (0). If some of the
# networks are more desirable, this field can be used to change the order in
# which wpa_supplicant goes through the networks when selecting a BSS. The
# priority groups will be iterated in decreasing priority (i.e., the larger the
# priority value, the sooner the network is matched against the scan results).
# Within each priority group, networks will be selected based on security
# policy, signal strength, etc.
# Please note that AP scanning with scan_ssid=1 and ap_scan=2 mode are not
# using this priority to select the order for scanning. Instead, they try the
# networks in the order that used in the configuration file.
#
# mode: IEEE 802.11 operation mode
# 0 = infrastructure (Managed) mode, i.e., associate with an AP (default)
# 1 = IBSS (ad-hoc, peer-to-peer)
# Note: IBSS can only be used with key_mgmt NONE (plaintext and static WEP)
# and key_mgmt=WPA-NONE (fixed group key TKIP/CCMP). In addition, ap_scan has
# to be set to 2 for IBSS. WPA-None requires following network block options:
# proto=WPA, key_mgmt=WPA-NONE, pairwise=NONE, group=TKIP (or CCMP, but not
# both), and psk must also be set.
#
# frequency: Channel frequency in megahertz (MHz) for IBSS, e.g.,
# 2412 = IEEE 802.11b/g channel 1. This value is used to configure the initial
# channel for IBSS (adhoc) networks. It is ignored in the infrastructure mode.
# In addition, this value is only used by the station that creates the IBSS. If
# an IBSS network with the configured SSID is already present, the frequency of
# the network will be used instead of this configured value.
#
# proto: list of accepted protocols
# WPA = WPA/IEEE 802.11i/D3.0
# RSN = WPA2/IEEE 802.11i (also WPA2 can be used as an alias for RSN)
# If not set, this defaults to: WPA RSN
#
# key_mgmt: list of accepted authenticated key management protocols
# WPA-PSK = WPA pre-shared key (this requires 'psk' field)
# WPA-EAP = WPA using EAP authentication (this can use an external
#	program, e.g., Xsupplicant, for IEEE 802.1X EAP Authentication
# IEEE8021X = IEEE 802.1X using EAP authentication and (optionally) dynamically
#	generated WEP keys
# NONE = WPA is not used; plaintext or static WEP could be used
# If not set, this defaults to: WPA-PSK WPA-EAP
#
# auth_alg: list of allowed IEEE 802.11 authentication algorithms
# OPEN = Open System authentication (required for WPA/WPA2)
# SHARED = Shared Key authentication (requires static WEP keys)
# LEAP = LEAP/Network EAP (only used with LEAP)
# If not set, automatic selection is used (Open System with LEAP enabled if
# LEAP is allowed as one of the EAP methods).
#
# pairwise: list of accepted pairwise (unicast) ciphers for WPA
# CCMP = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC [RFC 3610, IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# TKIP = Temporal Key Integrity Protocol [IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# NONE = Use only Group Keys (deprecated, should not be included if APs support
#	pairwise keys)
# If not set, this defaults to: CCMP TKIP
#
# group: list of accepted group (broadcast/multicast) ciphers for WPA
# CCMP = AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC [RFC 3610, IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# TKIP = Temporal Key Integrity Protocol [IEEE 802.11i/D7.0]
# WEP104 = WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) with 104-bit key
# WEP40 = WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) with 40-bit key [IEEE 802.11]
# If not set, this defaults to: CCMP TKIP WEP104 WEP40
#
# psk: WPA preshared key; 256-bit pre-shared key
# The key used in WPA-PSK mode can be entered either as 64 hex-digits, i.e.,
# 32 bytes or as an ASCII passphrase (in which case, the real PSK will be
# generated using the passphrase and SSID). ASCII passphrase must be between
# 8 and 63 characters (inclusive).
# This field is not needed, if WPA-EAP is used.
# Note: Separate tool, wpa_passphrase, can be used to generate 256-bit keys
# from ASCII passphrase. This process uses lot of CPU and wpa_supplicant
# startup and reconfiguration time can be optimized by generating the PSK only
# only when the passphrase or SSID has actually changed.
#
# eapol_flags: IEEE 802.1X/EAPOL options (bit field)
# Dynamic WEP key required for non-WPA mode
# bit0 (1): require dynamically generated unicast WEP key
# bit1 (2): require dynamically generated broadcast WEP key
# 	(3 = require both keys; default)
# Note: When using wired authentication, eapol_flags must be set to 0 for the
# authentication to be completed successfully.
#
# mixed_cell: This option can be used to configure whether so called mixed
# cells, i.e., networks that use both plaintext and encryption in the same
# SSID, are allowed when selecting a BSS form scan results.
# 0 = disabled (default)
# 1 = enabled
#
# proactive_key_caching:
# Enable/disable opportunistic PMKSA caching for WPA2.
# 0 = disabled (default)
# 1 = enabled
#
# wep_key0..3: Static WEP key (ASCII in double quotation, e.g. "abcde" or
# hex without quotation, e.g., 0102030405)
# wep_tx_keyidx: Default WEP key index (TX) (0..3)
#
# peerkey: Whether PeerKey negotiation for direct links (IEEE 802.11e DLS) is
# allowed. This is only used with RSN/WPA2.
# 0 = disabled (default)
# 1 = enabled
#peerkey=1
#
# Following fields are only used with internal EAP implementation.
# eap: space-separated list of accepted EAP methods
#	MD5 = EAP-MD5 (unsecure and does not generate keying material ->
#			cannot be used with WPA; to be used as a Phase 2 method
#			with EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS)
#       MSCHAPV2 = EAP-MSCHAPv2 (cannot be used separately with WPA; to be used
#		as a Phase 2 method with EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS)
#       OTP = EAP-OTP (cannot be used separately with WPA; to be used
#		as a Phase 2 method with EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS)
#       GTC = EAP-GTC (cannot be used separately with WPA; to be used
#		as a Phase 2 method with EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS)
#	TLS = EAP-TLS (client and server certificate)
#	PEAP = EAP-PEAP (with tunnelled EAP authentication)
#	TTLS = EAP-TTLS (with tunnelled EAP or PAP/CHAP/MSCHAP/MSCHAPV2
#			 authentication)
#	If not set, all compiled in methods are allowed.
#
# identity: Identity string for EAP
# anonymous_identity: Anonymous identity string for EAP (to be used as the
#	unencrypted identity with EAP types that support different tunnelled
#	identity, e.g., EAP-TTLS)
# password: Password string for EAP
# ca_cert: File path to CA certificate file (PEM/DER). This file can have one
#	or more trusted CA certificates. If ca_cert and ca_path are not
#	included, server certificate will not be verified. This is insecure and
#	a trusted CA certificate should always be configured when using
#	EAP-TLS/TTLS/PEAP. Full path should be used since working directory may
#	change when wpa_supplicant is run in the background.
#	On Windows, trusted CA certificates can be loaded from the system
#	certificate store by setting this to cert_store://<name>, e.g.,
#	ca_cert="cert_store://CA" or ca_cert="cert_store://ROOT".
#	Note that when running wpa_supplicant as an application, the user
#	certificate store (My user account) is used, whereas computer store
#	(Computer account) is used when running wpasvc as a service.
# ca_path: Directory path for CA certificate files (PEM). This path may
#	contain multiple CA certificates in OpenSSL format. Common use for this
#	is to point to system trusted CA list which is often installed into
#	directory like /etc/ssl/certs. If configured, these certificates are
#	added to the list of trusted CAs. ca_cert may also be included in that
#	case, but it is not required.
# client_cert: File path to client certificate file (PEM/DER)
#	Full path should be used since working directory may change when
#	wpa_supplicant is run in the background.
#	Alternatively, a named configuration blob can be used by setting this
#	to blob://<blob name>.
# private_key: File path to client private key file (PEM/DER/PFX)
#	When PKCS#12/PFX file (.p12/.pfx) is used, client_cert should be
#	commented out. Both the private key and certificate will be read from
#	the PKCS#12 file in this case. Full path should be used since working
#	directory may change when wpa_supplicant is run in the background.
#	Windows certificate store can be used by leaving client_cert out and
#	configuring private_key in one of the following formats:
#	cert://substring_to_match
#	hash://certificate_thumbprint_in_hex
#	for example: private_key="hash://63093aa9c47f56ae88334c7b65a4"
#	Note that when running wpa_supplicant as an application, the user
#	certificate store (My user account) is used, whereas computer store
#	(Computer account) is used when running wpasvc as a service.
#	Alternatively, a named configuration blob can be used by setting this
#	to blob://<blob name>.
# private_key_passwd: Password for private key file (if left out, this will be
#	asked through control interface)
# dh_file: File path to DH/DSA parameters file (in PEM format)
#	This is an optional configuration file for setting parameters for an
#	ephemeral DH key exchange. In most cases, the default RSA
#	authentication does not use this configuration. However, it is possible
#	setup RSA to use ephemeral DH key exchange. In addition, ciphers with
#	DSA keys always use ephemeral DH keys. This can be used to achieve
#	forward secrecy. If the file is in DSA parameters format, it will be
#	automatically converted into DH params.
# subject_match: Substring to be matched against the subject of the
#	authentication server certificate. If this string is set, the server
#	sertificate is only accepted if it contains this string in the subject.
#	The subject string is in following format:
#	/C=US/ST=CA/L=San Francisco/CN=Test AS/emailAddress=as@example.com
# altsubject_match: Semicolon separated string of entries to be matched against
#	the alternative subject name of the authentication server certificate.
#	If this string is set, the server sertificate is only accepted if it
#	contains one of the entries in an alternative subject name extension.
#	altSubjectName string is in following format: TYPE:VALUE
#	Example: EMAIL:server@example.com
#	Example: DNS:server.example.com;DNS:server2.example.com
#	Following types are supported: EMAIL, DNS, URI
# phase1: Phase1 (outer authentication, i.e., TLS tunnel) parameters
#	(string with field-value pairs, e.g., "peapver=0" or
#	"peapver=1 peaplabel=1")
#	'peapver' can be used to force which PEAP version (0 or 1) is used.
#	'peaplabel=1' can be used to force new label, "client PEAP encryption",
#	to be used during key derivation when PEAPv1 or newer. Most existing
#	PEAPv1 implementation seem to be using the old label, "client EAP
#	encryption", and wpa_supplicant is now using that as the default value.
#	Some servers, e.g., Radiator, may require peaplabel=1 configuration to
#	interoperate with PEAPv1; see eap_testing.txt for more details.
#	'peap_outer_success=0' can be used to terminate PEAP authentication on
#	tunneled EAP-Success. This is required with some RADIUS servers that
#	implement draft-josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap-05.txt (e.g.,
#	Lucent NavisRadius v4.4.0 with PEAP in "IETF Draft 5" mode)
#	include_tls_length=1 can be used to force wpa_supplicant to include
#	TLS Message Length field in all TLS messages even if they are not
#	fragmented.
#	sim_min_num_chal=3 can be used to configure EAP-SIM to require three
#	challenges (by default, it accepts 2 or 3)
# phase2: Phase2 (inner authentication with TLS tunnel) parameters
#	(string with field-value pairs, e.g., "auth=MSCHAPV2" for EAP-PEAP or
#	"autheap=MSCHAPV2 autheap=MD5" for EAP-TTLS)
# Following certificate/private key fields are used in inner Phase2
# authentication when using EAP-TTLS or EAP-PEAP.
# ca_cert2: File path to CA certificate file. This file can have one or more
#	trusted CA certificates. If ca_cert2 and ca_path2 are not included,
#	server certificate will not be verified. This is insecure and a trusted
#	CA certificate should always be configured.
# ca_path2: Directory path for CA certificate files (PEM)
# client_cert2: File path to client certificate file
# private_key2: File path to client private key file
# private_key2_passwd: Password for private key file
# dh_file2: File path to DH/DSA parameters file (in PEM format)
# subject_match2: Substring to be matched against the subject of the
#	authentication server certificate.
# altsubject_match2: Substring to be matched against the alternative subject
#	name of the authentication server certificate.
#
# fragment_size: Maximum EAP fragment size in bytes (default 1398).
#	This value limits the fragment size for EAP methods that support
#	fragmentation (e.g., EAP-TLS and EAP-PEAP). This value should be set
#	small enough to make the EAP messages fit in MTU of the network
#	interface used for EAPOL. The default value is suitable for most
#	cases.
#
# EAP-PSK variables:
# eappsk: 16-byte (128-bit, 32 hex digits) pre-shared key in hex format
# nai: user NAI
#
# EAP-PAX variables:
# eappsk: 16-byte (128-bit, 32 hex digits) pre-shared key in hex format
#
# EAP-SAKE variables:
# eappsk: 32-byte (256-bit, 64 hex digits) pre-shared key in hex format
#	(this is concatenation of Root-Secret-A and Root-Secret-B)
# nai: user NAI (PEERID)
#
# EAP-GPSK variables:
# eappsk: Pre-shared key in hex format (at least 128 bits, i.e., 32 hex digits)
# nai: user NAI (ID_Client)
#
# EAP-FAST variables:
# pac_file: File path for the PAC entries. wpa_supplicant will need to be able
#	to create this file and write updates to it when PAC is being
#	provisioned or refreshed. Full path to the file should be used since
#	working directory may change when wpa_supplicant is run in the
#	background. Alternatively, a named configuration blob can be used by
#	setting this to blob://<blob name>
# phase1: fast_provisioning=1 option enables in-line provisioning of EAP-FAST
#	credentials (PAC)
#
# wpa_supplicant supports number of "EAP workarounds" to work around
# interoperability issues with incorrectly behaving authentication servers.
# These are enabled by default because some of the issues are present in large
# number of authentication servers. Strict EAP conformance mode can be
# configured by disabling workarounds with eap_workaround=0.
