.Sh NAME
.Nm fingerd
.Nd remote user information server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm fingerd
.Op Fl lMmpSsu
.Op Fl P Ar filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
implements a simple protocol based on RFC 1288
that provides an interface to the
Name and Finger programs at several network sites.
The program is supposed to return a friendly,
human-oriented status report on either the system at the moment
or a particular person in depth.
There is no required format and the
protocol consists mostly of specifying a single
.Dq command line .
.Pp
.Nm
is started by
.Xr inetd 8 ,
which listens for TCP requests at port 79.
Once connected, it reads a single command line
terminated by a
.Aq CRLF
which is passed to
.Xr finger 1 .
.Nm
closes its connections as soon as the output is finished.
.Pp
If the line is null (i.e., just a
.Aq CRLF
is sent) then
.Xr finger 1
returns a
.Dq default
report that lists all people logged into
the system at that moment.
.Pp
If a user name is specified (e.g.,
.Pf eric Aq CRLF )
then the
response lists more extended information for only that particular user,
whether logged in or not.
Allowable
.Dq names
in the command line include both
.Dq login names
and
.Dq user names .
If a name is ambiguous, all possible derivations are returned.
.Pp
The following options may be passed to
.Nm
as server program arguments in
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
Enable logging.
The name of the host originating the query and the actual request
is reported via
.Xr syslog 3
at LOG_NOTICE priority.
A request of the form
.Sq /W
or
.Sq /w
will return long output.
Empty requests will return all currently logged in users.
All other requests look for specific users.
See RFC 1288 for details.
.It Fl M
Enables matching of
.Ar user
names.
This is disabled by default if the system is running YP.
.It Fl m
Prevent matching of
.Ar user
names.
.Ar User
is usually a login name; however, matching will also be done on the
users' real names, unless the
.Fl m
option is supplied.
.It Fl P Ar filename
Use an alternate program as the local information provider.
The default local program
executed by
.Nm
is
.Xr finger 1 .
By specifying a customized local server,
this option allows a system manager
to have more control over what information is
provided to remote sites.
.It Fl p
Prevents
.Xr finger 1
from displaying the contents of the
.Dq Pa .plan
and
.Dq Pa .project
files.
.It Fl S
Prints user information in short mode, one line per user.
This overrides the
.Dq Pa Whois switch
that may be passed in from the remote client.
.It Fl s
Enable secure mode.
Forwarding of queries to other remote hosts is denied.
.It Fl u
Queries without a user name are rejected.
