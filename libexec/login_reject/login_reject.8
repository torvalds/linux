.Sh NAME
.Nm login_reject
.Nd provide rejected authentication
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm login_reject
.Op Fl s Ar service
.Ar user
.Op Ar class
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the rejection authentication class.
The
.Ar user
name, while required, is ignored.
The
.Ar class
name, which is optional, is also ignored.
The
.Nm reject
authentication mechanism is intended to be used to disallow certain
types of logins.
For example, a class entry (see
.Xr login.conf 5 )
may contain:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
:auth=passwd:
:auth-ftp=reject:
.Ed
.Pp
which would allow password authentication for this class
but would reject attempts to authenticate from
.Xr ftpd 8 .

.Xr login.conf 5 ,
.Xr ftpd 8
