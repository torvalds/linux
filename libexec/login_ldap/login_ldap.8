.Dt LOGIN_LDAP 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm login_ldap
.Nd contact LDAP directory server for authentication
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm login_ldap
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl s Ar service
.Op Fl v Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
.Ar user
.Op Ar class
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility contacts an LDAP server to authenticate a
.Ar user .
.Pp
Available options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Print debugging information.
.It Fl s
Specify the service.
Currently only
.Dq login
and
.Dq response
are supported.
The challenge service is not supported, but it is not an error to specify
this service.
If this happens,
.Nm
will request the response service.
.It Fl v
This option is for compatibility and is ignored.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
searches for the
.Ar user
on the LDAP server based on the filter parameters in the configuration file.
If the user is found, it will try to bind to it using the supplied password.
.Pp
.Nm
uses the
.Ar ldap-conffile
.Xr login.conf 5
variable to determine the location of the configuration file.
If no
.Ar ldap-conffile
can be found, it will fall back to
.Pa /etc/login_ldap.conf .
The configuration file must be owned by root with group auth and permissions
0640.
.Sh LOGIN_LDAP.CONF VARIABLES
The login_ldap.conf file takes one key value pair per line separated by a
.Sq = .
No spaces are allowed between the
.Sq =
and
.Ar value .
The
.Ar key
may have leading and trailing whitespaces.
Empty lines and lines starting with a
.Sq #
are ignored.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility requires the following variables:
.Bl -tag -width basedn
.It Ar host
The hostname of the LDAP server or an LDAP URL.
The LDAP URL is described in the following format:
.Pp
.Sm off
.Op Ar protocol No ://
.Ar host Op : Ar port
.Sm on
.Pp
The following protocols are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "ldap+tls" -compact
.It ldap
Connect with TCP in plain text.
This is the default.
.It ldaps
Connect with TLS.
The default port is 636.
.It ldap+tls
Connect with TCP and enable TLS using the StartTLS operation.
.El
.Pp
Multiple host entries are supported and are tried in order of appearance.
.It Ar basedn
Point in the LDAP server's Directory Information Tree
.Nm
should begin searching for user objects.
This option can be omitted if the binddn points directly to the user entry.
.It Ar binddn
DN used by
.Nm
to bind to the LDAP server.
If no basedn is set, this is used to bind directly to the user and uses the user
supplied password.
Use FORMAT FILTERS to specify the username in this case.
.Pp
If basedn is set, it is used together with bindpw to bind to the LDAP server and
search for the user entry based on filter and scope.
If
.Ar binddn
is omitted and basedn is set, an anonymous bind is used to search for the user
entry.
.El
.Pp
In most cases, you will need to configure additional options.
The following entries to login_ldap.conf are also recognised by
.Nm
and are optional:
.Bl -tag -width cacertdir
.It Ar bindpw
Password used by
.Nm
to bind to the LDAP server.
Leave this out for a passwordless bind.
.It Ar filter
LDAP search filter (in accordance with RFC 1558) which identifies the
objectclasses and attributes necessary for
.Nm
to locate the user object.
See the
.Sx FILTER FORMATS
section for details.
.It Ar timeout
Time in seconds to wait for the LDAP server to respond to a query.
The default is 60 seconds per query, with up to four queries occurring.
.It Ar scope
The directory scope when performing the user lookup (first pass) search.
Acceptable values are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width baseXXX -offset indent -compact
.It base
Base object search
.It one
One level search
.It sub
Full subtree search
.El
.Pp
The default is sub if scope is unspecified.
.It Ar cacert
The pathname of the CA used for SSL certificates.
.It Ar cacertdir
The directory containing the certificates of trusted CAs.
.El
.Pp
An additional groupcheck can be performed to verify the user is allowed to log
in.
This can be done by specifying
.Ar gbasedn , Ar gfilter
and optionally
.Ar gscope .
See
.Ar basedn , Ar filter
and
.Ar scope
for semantics.
These checks are performed by the binddn user.
.Sh FILTER FORMATS
The following format specifiers are valid for the filter:
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It %u
Username.
The username of the user to be authenticated as specified by the
.Ar user
argument.
.It %h
Hostname.
The hostname of the host the user is trying to authenticate on,
as returned by
.Xr gethostname 3
and displayed by
.Xr hostname 1 .
.It %d
The dn of the user attempting authentication as returned from the first pass of
the search.
This option is only available to gfilter and gbasedn.
.It %%
A literal
.Sq %
character.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/examples/login_ldap.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/examples/login_ldap.conf
Example configuration file.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Ox 3.3
ports and was later mostly rewritten by
.An Martijn van Duren Aq Mt martijn@openbsd.org
and imported into
.Ox 6.8 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility was originally written by:
.Pp
.An Peter Werner Aq Mt peterw@ifost.org.au
.An Michael Erdely Aq Mt merdely@openbsd.org
.Sh CAVEATS
As there is no SASL support, passwords are sent to the LDAP server.
TLS should be used to protect the password in transit.
