.Sh NAME
.Nm makewhatis.local
.Nd start makewhatis for local file systems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /usr/libexec/makewhatis.local
.Op options
.Ar directories ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility starts
.Xr makewhatis 1
only for file systems physically mounted on the system
where
.Nm
is being executed.
Running makewhatis
by
.Pa periodic weekly
for rw nfs-mounted /usr may kill
your NFS server -- all NFS clients start makewhatis at the same time!
So use this wrapper for
.Xr cron 8
instead of calling makewhatis directly.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/periodic/weekly/320.whatis.XXX -compact
.It Pa /etc/periodic/weekly/320.whatis
run
.Nm
every week
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr find 1 ,
.Xr makewhatis 1 ,
.Xr cron 8 ,
.Xr periodic 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Fx 2.2 .
