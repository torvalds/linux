.Sh NAME
.Nm lockspool
.Nd lock user's system mailbox
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lockspool
.Op Ar username
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is useful for a client mail program to attain proper locking.
.Nm
obtains a
.Pa username.lock
for the calling user and retains it until stdin is closed or a signal like
.Dv SIGINT ,
.Dv SIGTERM ,
or
.Dv SIGHUP
is received.
Additionally, the superuser may specify the name of a user in order
to lock a different mailbox.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is able to create the lock file,
.Dq 1
is written to stdout, otherwise
.Dq 0
is written and an error message is written to stderr.
.Nm
will try up to 10 times to get the lock (sleeping
for a short period in between tries).
.Pp
Typical usage is for a user mail agent (such as
.Xr mail 1 )
to open a pipe to
.Nm
when it needs to lock the user's mail spool.
Closing the pipe will cause
.Nm
to release the lock.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/mail/username.lock -compact
.It Pa /var/mail/username.lock
user's mail lock file

.Sh EXIT STATUS
