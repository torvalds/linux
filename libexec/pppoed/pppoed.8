.Sh NAME
.Nm pppoed
.Nd handle incoming PPP over Ethernet connections
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Fd\&
.Op Fl P Ar pidfile
.Op Fl a Ar name
.Op Fl e Ar exec | Fl l Ar label
.Op Fl n Ar ngdebug
.Op Fl p Ar provider
.Ar interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility listens to the given
.Ar interface
for PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) service request packets, and actions them
by negotiating a session then invoking a
.Xr ppp 8
program.
The negotiation is implemented by the
.Dq pppoe
netgraph node.
See
.Xr ng_pppoe 4
for details.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
will only offer services to clients requesting services from the given
.Ar provider ,
which is taken as an empty name if not provided.
If a provider name of
.Dq *
is given, any PPPoE requests will be offered service.
.Pp
The supplied
.Ar name
will be given as the access concentrator name when establishing the connection.
If no
.Ar name
is given, the current base hostname is used.
.Pp
After receiving a request (PADI) from the PPPoE netgraph node,
.Nm
.Xr fork 2 Ns s
a child process and returns to service further requests.
The child process offers service
(using
.Ar name )
and waits for a
.Dv SUCCESS
indication from the PPPoE node.
On receipt of the
.Dv SUCCESS
indication,
.Nm
will execute
.Pp
.D1 Ic exec Pa /usr/sbin/ppp Fl direct Ar label
.Pp
as a shell sub-process.
If
.Ar label
has not been specified, it defaults to
.Ar provider .
It is possible to specify another command using the
.Ar exec
argument.
This is mandatory if
.Ar provider
and
.Ar label
are not given.
The child process will have standard input and standard output
attached to the same
.Xr netgraph 4
data socket
(see
.Xr ng_socket 4 )
when started.
.Pp
The environment variables
.Ev HISMACADDR
and
.Ev ACNAME
are made available to the child process and are set to the MAC address of
the peer and the name of the AC respectively.
.Pp
Upon invocation,
.Nm
will attach a
.Dq pppoe
netgraph node to the relevant
.Dq ether
node using
.Dq Ar interface Ns \&:
as the node name, and then connect that
.Dq pppoe
node to a local
.Dq socket
node.
If the
.Fl F
option has not been given,
.Nm
will then go into the background and disassociate itself from the controlling
terminal.
When the
.Fl F
option is given,
.Nm
stays in the foreground.
.Pp
If the
.Fl d
option is given, additional diagnostics are provided (see the
.Sx DIAGNOSTICS
section below).
If the
.Fl n
option is given,
.Fn NgSetDebug
is called with an argument of
.Ar ngdebug .
.Pp
If
.Ar pidfile
is given,
.Nm
will write its process ID to this file on startup.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
After creating the necessary
.Xr netgraph 4
nodes as described above,
.Nm
uses
.Xr syslogd 8
to report all incoming connections.
If the
.Fl d
option is given,
.Nm
will report on the child processes creation of a new netgraph socket, its
service offer and the invocation of the
.Xr ppp 8
program.
If the
.Fl n
option is given, netgraph diagnostic messages are also redirected to
.Xr syslogd 8 .
.Pp
It is sometimes useful to add the following to
.Pa /etc/syslog.conf :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
!pppoed
*.*				/var/log/pppoed.log
.Ed
.Pp
and the following to
.Pa /etc/newsyslog.conf :
.Pp
.Dl "/var/log/pppoed.log			640  3	   100	*     Z"

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility was written by
.An Brian Somers Aq Mt brian@Awfulhak.org
and first appeared in
.Fx 3.4 .
.Sh BUGS
If another netgraph node is using the given interface,
.Nm
will fail to start.
This is because
.Xr netgraph 4
does not currently allow node chaining.
This may change in the future.
