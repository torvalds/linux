.Tn YP
network credential file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Files in
.Nm
format are rare.
One lives in the
.Tn YP
map
.Pa netid.byname .
The format is rather simple.
Each row consists of two items: a key and a value.
When created by
.Xr mknetid 8
there are three types of records.
.Pp
The first type is information about which GIDs a UID has:
.Pp
.Sm off
.Li unix . Ao Ar uid Ac @ Aq Ar yp-domain
.Sm on
.Sm off
.Ao Ar uid Ac : Ao Ar gid Ac , Aq Ar gid
.Sm on
.Pp
The second type contains information about hosts:
.Pp
.Sm off
.Li unix . Ao Ar hostname Ac @ Aq Ar yp-domain
.Sm on
.Sm off
.Li 0 : Aq Ar hostname
.Sm on
.Pp
The third type refers to records from a
.Nm
file other than the two types above.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/netid" -compact
.It Pa /etc/netid
for lines not generated automatically by
.Xr mknetid 8
