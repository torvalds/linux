.Sh NAME
.Nm mknetid
.Nd "generate netid map data"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl g Ar group_file
.Op Fl p Ar passwd_file
.Op Fl h Ar hosts_file
.Op Fl n Ar netid_file
.Op Fl d Ar domain
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility processes the contents of the
.Xr group 5 ,
.Xr passwd 5 ,
.Xr hosts 5
and
.Xr netid 5
files into the format used to generate the
.Pa netid.byname
.Tn NIS
map.
This map is used to hold credential information for both users
and hosts in an operating system independent format.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility checks for duplicate occurrences of netids and filters
them out.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility prints its results on the standard output.
It is usually called
only by
.Pa /var/yp/Makefile
when rebuilding the
.Tn NIS
maps.
.Sh OPTIONS
The
.Nm
utility supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl q
Normally,
.Nm
prints a warning message when it encounters a duplicate netid.
This flag turns on 'quiet' mode, allowing the warnings to be
suppressed.
Other error messages may still be generated.
.It Fl g Ar group_file
Specify the location of the group information
file.
The compiled-in default is
.Pa /etc/group .
.It Fl p Ar passwd_file
Specify the location of the passwd information
file.
The compiled-in default is
.Pa /etc/passwd .
.It Fl h Ar hosts_file
Specify the location of the hosts database
file.
The compiled-in default is
.Pa /etc/hosts .
.It Fl n Ar netid_file
Specify the location of the netid information
file.
The compiled-in default is
.Pa /etc/netid .
Note that no error is generated if the netid database cannot be
found.
The netid database is not likely to be present on most systems
until
.Tn Secure RPC
support is added to
.Fx .
.It Fl d Ar domain
By default, the
.Nm
utility uses the system domainname when generating netid records.
If
the system domainname is not set, the domain must be specified on the
command line with the
.Fl d
flag.
If the domainname is set, the
.Fl d
flag may be used to override it.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/yp/Makefile -compact
.It Pa /var/yp/Makefile
the Makefile that calls
.Nm yp_mkdb
and
.Nm
to build the
.Tn NIS
databases
.It Pa /etc/group
the default group database file
.It Pa /etc/passwd
the default passwd database file
.It Pa /etc/hosts
the default hosts database file
.It Pa /etc/netid
the default netid database file
