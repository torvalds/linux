# manage_pid argument
#	Create or remove a pidfile manually, for daemons that can't be bothered
#	to do it themselves. Takes one argument, which is the argument provided
#	to the rc script. The pidfile will be named /var/run/<$name>.pid,
#	unless $pidfile is defined.
#
#	The method used to determine the pid is rather hacky; grep ps output to
#	find '$procname|$command', then grep for ${name}_flags. If at all
#	possible, use another method if at all possible, to avoid that dirty-
#	code feeling.

# Allow ftp-proxy to start up in two different ways. The typical behavior
# is to start up one instance of ftp-proxy by setting ftpproxy_enable and
# ftpproxy_flags. The alternate behavior allows multiple instances of ftp-
# proxy to be started, allowing different types of proxy behavior. To use the
# new behavior, a list of instances must be defined, and a list of flags for
# each instance. For example, if we want to start two instances of ftp-proxy,
# foo and bar, we would set the following vars.
#	ftpproxy_enable="YES"
#	ftpproxy_instances="foo bar"
#	ftpproxy_foo="<arguments for foo>"
#	ftpproxy_bar="<arguments for bar>"
#
# Starting more than one ftp-proxy?
