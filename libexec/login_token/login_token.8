.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm login_token
program implements an X9.9 token card challenge response authentication
mechanism (see
.Xr login.conf 5 ) .
It must be invoked by one of the names:
.Nm login_activ , login_crypto ,
or
.Nm login_snk .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl s Ar service
Specify the service.

.Li challenge ,
.Li login ,
and
.Li response
are supported.
.It Fl v Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value

.Nm login_token
will look up
.Ar user
in the appropriate database file, depending on what name it was called as:
.Pa /etc/activ.db ,
.Pa /etc/crypto.db ,
or
.Pa /etc/snk.db .
It then will issue a challenge, and if the user
is able to correctly respond (by using the appropriate token)
the user will be authenticated.
The
.Ar class
argument is unused.
