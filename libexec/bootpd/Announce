# $FreeBSD$

This is an enhanced version of the CMU BOOTP server which was derived
from the original BOOTP server created by Bill Croft at Stanford.
This version merges most of the enhancements and bug-fixes from the
NetBSD, Columbia, and other versions.

New features in version 2.4 include:

	Added a simple BOOTP gateway program: bootpgw
	Allow host name anywhere IP address is expected.
	Automatically lookup the IP address when the name of a
		bootptab entry is a valid hostname.
		(Dummy entries names should start with '.')
	Merged changes from NetBSD and Columbia versions.
	Merged changes for Solaris-2.X and SVR4 systems.
	Combined bootptest into the bootp release.
	Merged tag 18 support (:ef=...:) from Jason Zions.
		Use :ef=extension_file_name: and make the
		extension files for all clients using bootpef.
	Merged HP compatibility (:ra=...:) from David R Linn.
		Allows you to override the reply address.
		(i.e. send the reply to a broadcast address)
	Add /etc/ethers support for NetBSD.
	More systems support getether (Ultrix, OSF, NetBSD)
	Added RFC 1533 tags 40,41,42
		:yd=<NIS domain>:ys=<NIS server>:nt=<NTP server>:
	ConvOldTab.sh to convert old (1.1) bootptab to new format.
	Permits extended-length replies with more option data.

Problems fixed in this version:

	Fixed references to free host structures.
		(used to cause core dump on Solaris)
	Remove change that added null terminator to string options.
		(this annoyed some clients...)
	Add missing symbols to dump routine, fix order.
	Works (again) with no -DSYSLOGD defined.
	Fixed several more NULL references in readfile.
	Added proper length checks to option insertions.
	Fixed bootptest IP address printing.
	Cleaned-up signed/unsigned and byteorder bugs.
	Added SVR4/Streams support to getif and getether
	Removed extra newlines in syslog messages.
	Specify facility code when calling syslog(3)
	When lookup_hwa fails, assume numeric HW address.

Systems on which I have seen this code work:
	NetBSD-1.0 (BSD-4.4 derivative)
	SunOS 4.X (Solaris 1.X)
	SunOS 5.X (Solaris 2.X)
	System V/386 Rel. 4.0

Systems on which others say this code works:
	CDC EP/IX (1.4.3, 2.1.1)
	DEC Ultrix (4.2, 4.3)
	Linux 1.1.81
	OSF/1 (DEC Alpha CPU)
