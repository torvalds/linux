.Dt SPAMD-SETUP 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm spamd-setup
.Nd parse and load file of spammer addresses
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm spamd-setup
.Op Fl bDdn
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sends blacklist data to
.Xr spamd 8 ,
as well as configuring mail rejection messages for
blacklist entries.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is run in blacklist only mode,
it also sends blacklist data to the
.Xr pf 4
table
.Pf < Ar spamd Ns > .
The
.Pf < Ar spamd Ns >
table must then be used in conjunction with a
.Xr pf 4
redirection rule to selectively redirect mail connections
to
.Xr spamd 8 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Blacklisting only mode.
Blacklist data is normally stored only in
.Xr spamd 8 .
With this flag, data is stored in both
.Xr spamd 8
and
.Xr pf 4 .
Use this flag if
.Xr spamd 8
is running with the
.Fl b
flag too.
.It Fl D
Daemonize;
run
.Nm
in the background.
.It Fl d
Debug mode reports a few pieces of information.
.It Fl n
Dry-run mode.
No data is shipped.
.El
.Pp
Lists are specified in the configuration file
.Pa /etc/mail/spamd.conf
and are processed in the order specified in the
.Ar all
tag.
Output is concatenated and sent to a running
.Xr spamd 8 .
Addresses are sent
along with the message spamd will give on mail rejection when a
matching client connects.
The configuration port for
.Xr spamd 8
is found from
.Xr services 5 ,
by looking for the named service
.Em spamd-cfg .
.Pp
.Nm
reads all configuration information from the
.Xr spamd.conf 5
file.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /etc/mail/spamd.conf
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pf.conf 5 ,
.Xr services 5 ,
.Xr spamd.conf 5 ,
.Xr spamd 8
.Sh BUGS
Blacklists removed from
.Pa /etc/mail/spamd.conf
are not automatically removed from the running
.Xr spamd 8 .
If an entry is removed from
.Pa /etc/mail/spamd.conf
that is currently in use, it is necessary to restart
.Xr spamd 8 .
This applies only to blacklists that are removed entirely, not those
that are simply modified.
