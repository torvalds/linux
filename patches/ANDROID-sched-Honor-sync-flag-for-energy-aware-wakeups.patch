Subject: ANDROID: sched: Honor sync flag for energy-aware wakeups

Since we don't do energy-aware wakeups when we are overutilized, always
honoring sync wakeups in this state does not prevent wake-wide mechanics
overruling the flag as normal.

Having the check for (cpu_rq(cpu)->nr_running == 1) in the test condition
means that we only bypass the energy model for sync wakeups where the
cpu is about to become idle. This matches the use of this flag in Binder
which is the main place where sync wakeups come from in Android.

This patch is based upon previous work to build EAS for android products.
It replaces
commit 79e3a4a27ee5 ("ANDROID: sched: Unconditionally honor sync flag
 for energy-aware wakeups")
in what's considered to be 'EAS'.
