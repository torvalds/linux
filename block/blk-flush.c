 *
 * REQ_{FLUSH|FUA} requests are decomposed to sequences consisted of three
 * optional steps - PREFLUSH, DATA and POSTFLUSH - according to the request
 * properties and hardware capability.
 *
 * If a request doesn't have data, only REQ_PREFLUSH makes sense, which
 * indicates a simple flush request.  If there is data, REQ_PREFLUSH indicates
 * that the device cache should be flushed before the data is executed, and
 * REQ_FUA means that the data must be on non-volatile media on request
 * completion.
 *
 * If the device doesn't have writeback cache, FLUSH and FUA don't make any
 * difference.  The requests are either completed immediately if there's no
 * data or executed as normal requests otherwise.
 *
 * If the device has writeback cache and supports FUA, REQ_PREFLUSH is
 * translated to PREFLUSH but REQ_FUA is passed down directly with DATA.
 *
 * If the device has writeback cache and doesn't support FUA, REQ_PREFLUSH
 * is translated to PREFLUSH and REQ_FUA to POSTFLUSH.
 *
 * The actual execution of flush is double buffered.  Whenever a request
 * needs to execute PRE or POSTFLUSH, it queues at
 * fq->flush_queue[fq->flush_pending_idx].  Once certain criteria are met, a
 * REQ_OP_FLUSH is issued and the pending_idx is toggled.  When the flush
 * completes, all the requests which were pending are proceeded to the next
 * step.  This allows arbitrary merging of different types of FLUSH/FUA
 * requests.
 *
 * Currently, the following conditions are used to determine when to issue
 * flush.
 *
 * C1. At any given time, only one flush shall be in progress.  This makes
 *     double buffering sufficient.
 *
 * C2. Flush is deferred if any request is executing DATA of its sequence.
 *     This avoids issuing separate POSTFLUSHes for requests which shared
 *     PREFLUSH.
 *
 * C3. The second condition is ignored if there is a request which has
 *     waited longer than FLUSH_PENDING_TIMEOUT.  This is to avoid
 *     starvation in the unlikely case where there are continuous stream of
 *     FUA (without FLUSH) requests.
 *
 * For devices which support FUA, it isn't clear whether C2 (and thus C3)
 * is beneficial.
 *
 * Note that a sequenced FLUSH/FUA request with DATA is completed twice.
 * Once while executing DATA and again after the whole sequence is
 * complete.  The first completion updates the contained bio but doesn't
 * finish it so that the bio submitter is notified only after the whole
 * sequence is complete.  This is implemented by testing RQF_FLUSH_SEQ in
 * req_bio_endio().
 *
 * The above peculiarity requires that each FLUSH/FUA request has only one
 * bio attached to it, which is guaranteed as they aren't allowed to be
 * merged in the usual way.
