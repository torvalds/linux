	  MQ version of the deadline IO scheduler.

config MQ_IOSCHED_KYBER
	tristate "Kyber I/O scheduler"
	default y
	help
	  The Kyber I/O scheduler is a low-overhead scheduler suitable for
	  multiqueue and other fast devices. Given target latencies for reads and
	  synchronous writes, it will self-tune queue depths to achieve that
	  goal.

config IOSCHED_BFQ
	tristate "BFQ I/O scheduler"
	help
	BFQ I/O scheduler for BLK-MQ. BFQ distributes the bandwidth of
	of the device among all processes according to their weights,
	regardless of the device parameters and with any workload. It
	also guarantees a low latency to interactive and soft
	real-time applications.  Details in
	Documentation/block/bfq-iosched.rst

	help

       Enable hierarchical scheduling in BFQ, using the blkio
       (cgroups-v1) or io (cgroups-v2) controller.

	depends on BFQ_GROUP_IOSCHED
