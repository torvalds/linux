.Sh NAME
.Nm core.lua
.Nd FreeBSD core module
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
contains core functionality that does not have a more fitting module.
.Pp
Before hooking into or using the functionality provided by
.Nm ,
it must be included with a statement such as the following:
.Pp
.Dl local core = require("core")
.Ss CONSTANTS
The following raw key code constants are defined in
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width KEY_BACKSPACE -compact -offset indent
.It Ic KEY_BACKSPACE
The backspace code.
Should generally be checked along with
.Ic KEY_DELETE
for backspace functionality.
.It Ic KEY_ENTER
The enter key, or hard return.
.It Ic KEY_DELETE
The delete code.
Should generally be checked along with
.Ic KEY_BACKSPACE
for backspace functionality.
.El
.Pp
The following key-string constants are defined in
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width KEYSTR_ESCAPE -compact -offset indent
.It Ic KEYSTR_ESCAPE
The escape key.
.It Ic KEYSTR_CSI
The ANSI CSI sequence.
.El
.Pp
The following menu entry type constants are defined in
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width MENU_CAROUSEL_ENTRY -compact -offset indent
.It Ic MENU_RETURN
Return to the parent menu.
.It Ic MENU_ENTRY
A normal menu entry.
.It Ic MENU_SEPARATOR
A menu entry that serves as a separator.
.It Ic MENU_SUBMENU
A menu entry that opens a submenu when selected.
.It Ic MENU_CAROUSEL_ENTRY
A menu entry that rotates through items like a carousel upon selection of the
menu entry.
.El
.Pp
Please see
.Xr menu.lua 8
for extended descriptions and usage of the
.Ic MENU_*
constants.
.Ss Exported functions
The following functions are exported from
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width core.getACPIPresent -offset indent
.It Fn core.setVerbose verbose
Sets or unsets
.Ev boot_verbose .
If
.Fa verbose
is omitted, toggle the current verbose setting.
.It Fn core.setSingleUser singleUser
Sets or unsets
.Ev boot_single .
If
.Fa singleUser
is omitted, toggle the current single user setting.
.It Fn core.getACPIPresent checkingSystemDefaults
Check whether ACPI is present.
This will only be accurate for i386-compatible loaders, including non-UEFI
loaders on amd64 systems.
If
.Fa checkingSystemDefaults
is true, ignore the current value of
.Ev hint.acpi.0.disabled .
Otherwise, return true only if ACPI is both present and not disabled.
.It Fn core.setACPI acpi
Sets or unsets
.Ev acpi_load ,
.Ev hint.acpi.0.disabled ,
and
.Ev loader.acpi_disabled_by_user .
If
.Fa acpi
is omitted, toggle the current ACPI setting.
.It Fn core.setSafeMode safeMode
Set the safe mode setting.
Sets or unsets
.Ev kern.smp.disabled ,
.Ev hw.ata.ata_dma ,
.Ev hw.ata.atapi_dma ,
.Ev hw.ata.wc ,
.Ev hw.eisa_slots ,
.Ev kern.eventtimer.periodic ,
and
.Ev kern.geom.part.check_integrity .
If
.Fa safeMode
is omitted, toggle the current safe mode setting.
.It Fn core.clearCachedKernels
Clears out the cache of kernels to be displayed on the boot menu.
This function is registered as a
.Ev config.reloaded
hook.
It is used to invalidate the kernel list whenever it may have changed, either
due to a boot environment change or a potential change in either
.Ic kernel
or
.Ic kernels .
.It Fn core.kernelList
Returns a table of kernels to display on the boot menu.
This will combine
.Ic kernel
and
.Ic kernels
from
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
If
.Ic kernels_autodetect
is set in
.Xr loader.conf 5 ,
kernels will be autodetected from the current system.
.It Fn core.bootenvDefault
Returns the default boot environment, nil if unset.
.It Fn core.bootenvList
Returns a table of boot environments, or an empty table.
These will be picked up using the
.Ev bootenvs
and
.Ev bootenvs_count
variables set by
.Xr loader 8 .
.It Fn core.setDefaults
Resets ACPI, safe mode, single user, and verbose settings to their system
defauilts.
.It Fn core.autoboot argstr
Loads the kernel and specified modules, then invokes the
.Ic autoboot
.Xr loader 8
command with
.Fa argstr
as-is.
.It Fn core.boot argstr
Loads the kernel and specified modules, then invokes the
.Ic boot
.Xr loader 8
command with
.Fa argstr
as-is.
.It Fn core.isSingleUserBoot
Returns true if
.Ev boot_single
is set to yes.
.It Fn core.isZFSBoot
Returns true if
.Ev currdev
is set to a
.Xr zfs 8
dataset.
.It Fn core.isSerialBoot
Returns true if we are booting over serial.
This checks
.Ev console ,
.Ev boot_serial ,
and
.Ev boot_multicons .
.It Fn core.isSystem386
Returns true if this bootloader was compiled as an i386 binary.
This generally applies to i386 loaders as well as non-UEFI loaders on amd64.
.It Fn core.deepCopyTable tbl
Recursively deep copies
.Fa tbl
and returns the result.
.It Fn core.popFrontTable tbl
Pops the front element off of
.Fa tbl ,
and returns two return values: the front element, and the rest of the table.
If there are no elements, this returns nil and nil.
If there is one element, this returns the front element and an empty table.
This will not operate on truly associative tables; numeric indices are
required.
