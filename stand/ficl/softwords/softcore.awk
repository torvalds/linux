#
# Convert forth source files to a giant C string
#
# Joe Abley <jabley@patho.gen.nz>, 12 January 1999
#
# 02-oct-1999:  Cleaned up awk slightly; added some additional logic
#               suggested by dcs to compress the stored forth program.
#
# Note! This script uses strftime() which is a gawk-ism, and the
# POSIX [[:space:]] character class.
