.Nd FreeBSD version string boot module
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file that goes by the name of
.Nm
is a set of commands designed to draw the boot loader
version at the bottom-right of the screen.
The commands of
.Nm
by themselves are not enough for most uses.
Please refer to the
examples below for the most common situations, and to
.Xr loader 8
for additional commands.
.Pp
Before using any of the commands provided in
.Nm ,
it must be included
through the command:
.Pp
.Dl include version.4th
.Pp
This line is present in the default
.Pa /boot/menu.rc
file, so it is not needed (and should not be re-issued) in a normal setup.
.Pp
The commands provided by it are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width disable-module_module -compact -offset indent
.It Ic print_version
Prints the contents of the
.Va loader_version
environment variable right-justified at the column
.Va loader_version_x
and row
.Va loader_version_y .
.El
.Pp
The environment variables that effect its behavior are:
.Bl -tag -width bootfile -offset indent
.It Va loader_version
Set automatically by
.Xr loader 8 ,
but you can override it by setting in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .

.It Va loader_version_x
Sets the desired ending column position of
.Va loader_version .
Default is 80.
.It Va loader_version_y
Sets the desired ending row position of
.Va loader_version .
Default is 24.
.It Va loader_color
If set to
.Dq Li NO
(case-insensitive) or
.Dq Li 0 ,
causes the version to be printed without color
.Pq default is ANSI Cyan .
