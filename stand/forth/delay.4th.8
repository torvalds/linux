.Sh NAME
.Nm delay.4th
.Nd FreeBSD debugging boot module
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file that goes by the name of
.Nm
is a set of commands designed to add debugging capabilities to
.Xr loader 8 .
The commands of
.Nm
by themselves are not enough for most uses.
Please refer to the
examples below for the most common situations, and to
.Xr loader 8
for additional commands.
.Pp
Before using any of the commands provided in
.Nm ,
it must be included
through the command:
.Pp
.Dl include delay.4th
.Pp
This line is present in
.Pa /boot/beastie.4th
file, so it is not needed (and should not be re-issued) in a normal setup.
.Pp
The commands provided by it are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width disable-module_module -compact -offset indent
.It Ic delay_execute
Executes the [string] procedure stored in the
.Ic delay_command
environment variable after
.Ic loader_delay
seconds.
.Pp
If the optional
.Ic delay_showdots
environment variable is set, a continuous series of dots is printed.
.Pp
During the duration, the user can either press Ctrl-C (or Esc) to abort or
ENTER to proceed immediately.
.El
.Pp
The environment variables that effect its behavior are:
.Bl -tag -width bootfile -offset indent
.It Va delay_command
The command to be executed by
.Ic delay_execute .
.It Va loader_delay
The duration (in seconds) to delay before executing
.Ic delay_command .
.It Va delay_showdots
If set, will cause
.Ic delay_execute
to print a continuous series of dots during the delay duration.
.El
.Sh FILES
