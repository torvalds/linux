	  Choose Y here to enable Secure RPC using the Kerberos version 5
	  GSS-API mechanism (RFC 1964).

	  Secure RPC calls with Kerberos require an auxiliary user-space
	  daemon which may be found in the Linux nfs-utils package
	  available from http://linux-nfs.org/.  In addition, user-space
	  Kerberos support should be installed.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config SUNRPC_DISABLE_INSECURE_ENCTYPES

	default n
	help
	  Choose Y here to disable the use of deprecated encryption types
	  with the Kerberos version 5 GSS-API mechanism (RFC 1964). The
	  deprecated encryption types include DES-CBC-MD5, DES-CBC-CRC,
	  and DES-CBC-MD4. These types were deprecated by RFC 6649 because
	  they were found to be insecure.

	  N is the default because many sites have deployed KDCs and
	  keytabs that contain only these deprecated encryption types.
	  Choosing Y prevents the use of known-insecure encryption types
	  but might result in compatibility problems.

config SUNRPC_DEBUG

	select DEBUG_FS
	help
	  This option enables a sysctl-based debugging interface
	  that is be used by the 'rpcdebug' utility to turn on or off
	  logging of different aspects of the kernel RPC activity.

	  Disabling this option will make your kernel slightly smaller,
	  but makes troubleshooting NFS issues significantly harder.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	help
	  This option allows the NFS client and server to use RDMA
	  transports (InfiniBand, iWARP, or RoCE).

	  To compile this support as a module, choose M. The module
	  will be called rpcrdma.ko.

	  If unsure, or you know there is no RDMA capability on your
	  hardware platform, say N.
