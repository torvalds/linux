config CFG80211
        tristate "Improved wireless configuration API"

config NL80211
	bool "nl80211 new netlink interface support"
	depends on CFG80211
	default y
	---help---
         This option turns on the new netlink interface
         (nl80211) support in cfg80211.

         If =n, drivers using mac80211 will be configured via
         wireless extension support provided by that subsystem.

         If unsure, say Y.

config WIRELESS_EXT
	bool "Wireless extensions"
	default n
	---help---
	  This option enables the legacy wireless extensions
	  (wireless network interface configuration via ioctls.)

	  Wireless extensions will be replaced by cfg80211 and
	  will be required only by legacy drivers that implement
	  wireless extension handlers. This option does not
	  affect the wireless-extension backward compatibility
	  code in cfg80211.

	  Say N (if you can) unless you know you need wireless
	  extensions for external modules.
