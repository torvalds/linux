config CFG80211
        tristate "Improved wireless configuration API"

config WIRELESS_EXT
	bool "Wireless extensions"
	default n
	---help---
	  This option enables the legacy wireless extensions
	  (wireless network interface configuration via ioctls.)

	  Wireless extensions will be replaced by cfg80211 and
	  will be required only by legacy drivers that implement
	  wireless extension handlers.

	  Say N (if you can) unless you know you need wireless
	  extensions for external modules.
