	---help---
	  If you say Y here, then your Linux box will be able to act as a
	  DANH ("Doubly attached node implementing HSR"). For this to work,
	  your Linux box needs (at least) two physical Ethernet interfaces,
	  and it must be connected as a node in a ring network together with
	  other HSR capable nodes.

	  All Ethernet frames sent over the hsr device will be sent in both
	  directions on the ring (over both slave ports), giving a redundant,
	  instant fail-over network. Each HSR node in the ring acts like a
	  bridge for HSR frames, but filters frames that have been forwarded
	  earlier.

	  This code is a "best effort" to comply with the HSR standard as
	  described in IEC 62439-3:2010 (HSRv0) and IEC 62439-3:2012 (HSRv1),
	  but no compliancy tests have been made. Use iproute2 to select
	  the version you desire.

	  You need to perform any and all necessary tests yourself before
	  relying on this code in a safety critical system!

	  If unsure, say N.
