config NET
	bool "Networking support"
	---help---
	  Unless you really know what you are doing, you should say Y here.
	  The reason is that some programs need kernel networking support even
	  when running on a stand-alone machine that isn't connected to any
	  other computer. If you are upgrading from an older kernel, you
	  should consider updating your networking tools too because changes
	  in the kernel and the tools often go hand in hand. The tools are
	  contained in the package net-tools, the location and version number
	  of which are given in <file:Documentation/Changes>.

	  For a general introduction to Linux networking, it is highly
	  recommended to read the NET-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

config PACKET
	tristate "Packet socket"
	---help---
	  The Packet protocol is used by applications which communicate
	  directly with network devices without an intermediate network
	  protocol implemented in the kernel, e.g. tcpdump.  If you want them
	  to work, choose Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called af_packet.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config PACKET_MMAP
	bool "Packet socket: mmapped IO"
	depends on PACKET
	help
	  If you say Y here, the Packet protocol driver will use an IO
	  mechanism that results in faster communication.

	  If unsure, say N.

config UNIX
	tristate "Unix domain sockets"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, you will include support for Unix domain sockets;
	  sockets are the standard Unix mechanism for establishing and
	  accessing network connections.  Many commonly used programs such as
	  the X Window system and syslog use these sockets even if your
	  machine is not connected to any network.  Unless you are working on
	  an embedded system or something similar, you therefore definitely
	  want to say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called unix.  Note that several important services won't work
	  correctly if you say M here and then neglect to load the module.

	  Say Y unless you know what you are doing.

config NET_KEY
	tristate "PF_KEY sockets"
	select XFRM
	---help---
	  PF_KEYv2 socket family, compatible to KAME ones.
	  They are required if you are going to use IPsec tools ported
	  from KAME.

	  Say Y unless you know what you are doing.

config INET
	bool "TCP/IP networking"
	---help---
	  These are the protocols used on the Internet and on most local
	  Ethernets. It is highly recommended to say Y here (this will enlarge
	  your kernel by about 144 KB), since some programs (e.g. the X window
	  system) use TCP/IP even if your machine is not connected to any
	  other computer. You will get the so-called loopback device which
	  allows you to ping yourself (great fun, that!).

	  For an excellent introduction to Linux networking, please read the
	  Linux Networking HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you say Y here and also to "/proc file system support" and
	  "Sysctl support" below, you can change various aspects of the
	  behavior of the TCP/IP code by writing to the (virtual) files in
	  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/*; the options are explained in the file
	  <file:Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt>.

	  Short answer: say Y.

menuconfig NETFILTER
	bool "Network packet filtering (replaces ipchains)"
	---help---
	  Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets
	  that pass through your Linux box.

	  The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as
	  a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of
	  firewall provided by this kernel support is called a "packet
	  filter", which means that it can reject individual network packets
	  based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall,
	  a "proxy-based" one, is more secure but more intrusive and more
	  bothersome to set up; it inspects the network traffic much more
	  closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level
	  protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based
	  firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local
	  clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but
	  they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if
	  you say Y here.

	  You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as
	  the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without
	  globally valid IP addresses. This is called "masquerading": if one
	  of the computers on your local network wants to send something to
	  the outside, your box can "masquerade" as that computer, i.e. it
	  forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but
	  modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the
	  firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host
	  replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the
	  correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net
	  are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can
	  reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to
	  run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network
	  using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often
	  called NAT (Network Address Translation).

	  Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on
	  the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux
	  box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server,
	  typically a caching proxy server.

	  Yet another use of Netfilter is building a bridging firewall. Using
	  a bridge with Network packet filtering enabled makes iptables "see"
	  the bridged traffic. For filtering on the lower network and Ethernet
	  protocols over the bridge, use ebtables (under bridge netfilter
	  configuration).

	  Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous
	  masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent
	  proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see
	  <file:Documentation/Changes> under "iptables" for the location of
	  these packages.

	  Make sure to say N to "Fast switching" below if you intend to say Y
	  here, as Fast switching currently bypasses netfilter.

	  Chances are that you should say Y here if you compile a kernel which
	  will run as a router and N for regular hosts. If unsure, say N.

	---help---
	  ATM is a high-speed networking technology for Local Area Networks
	  and Wide Area Networks.  It uses a fixed packet size and is
	  connection oriented, allowing for the negotiation of minimum
	  bandwidth requirements.

	  In order to participate in an ATM network, your Linux box needs an
	  ATM networking card. If you have that, say Y here and to the driver
	  of your ATM card below.

	  Note that you need a set of user-space programs to actually make use
	  of ATM.  See the file <file:Documentation/networking/atm.txt> for
	  further details.

config ATM_CLIP

	  network, you will typically either say Y here or to "LAN Emulation
	  (LANE)" below.

config ATM_CLIP_NO_ICMP
	bool "Do NOT send ICMP if no neighbour (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on ATM_CLIP
	help
	  Normally, an "ICMP host unreachable" message is sent if a neighbour
	  cannot be reached because there is no VC to it in the kernel's
	  ATMARP table. This may cause problems when ATMARP table entries are
	  briefly removed during revalidation. If you say Y here, packets to

config ATM_LANE
	tristate "LAN Emulation (LANE) support (EXPERIMENTAL)"

	help
	  LAN Emulation emulates services of existing LANs across an ATM

config BRIDGE
	tristate "802.1d Ethernet Bridging"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, then your Linux box will be able to act as an
	  Ethernet bridge, which means that the different Ethernet segments it
	  is connected to will appear as one Ethernet to the participants.
	  Several such bridges can work together to create even larger
	  networks of Ethernets using the IEEE 802.1 spanning tree algorithm.
	  As this is a standard, Linux bridges will cooperate properly with
	  other third party bridge products.

	  In order to use the Ethernet bridge, you'll need the bridge
	  configuration tools; see <file:Documentation/networking/bridge.txt>
	  for location. Please read the Bridge mini-HOWTO for more
	  information.

	  If you enable iptables support along with the bridge support then you
	  turn your bridge into a bridging IP firewall.
	  iptables will then see the IP packets being bridged, so you need to
	  take this into account when setting up your firewall rules.
	  Enabling arptables support when bridging will let arptables see
	  bridged ARP traffic in the arptables FORWARD chain.

	  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called bridge.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  everything a regular ethernet interface does, including
	  firewalling, bridging, and of course IP traffic.  You will need
	  the 'vconfig' tool from the VLAN project in order to effectively
	  use VLANs.  See the VLAN web page for more information:
	  <http://www.candelatech.com/~greear/vlan.html>

	  If unsure, say N.

config DECNET
	tristate "DECnet Support"
	---help---
	  The DECnet networking protocol was used in many products made by
	  Digital (now Compaq).  It provides reliable stream and sequenced
	  packet communications over which run a variety of services similar
	  to those which run over TCP/IP.

	  To find some tools to use with the kernel layer support, please
	  look at Patrick Caulfield's web site:
	  <http://linux-decnet.sourceforge.net/>.

	  More detailed documentation is available in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/decnet.txt>.

	  Be sure to say Y to "/proc file system support" and "Sysctl support"
	  below when using DECnet, since you will need sysctl support to aid
	  in configuration at run time.

	  The DECnet code is also available as a module ( = code which can be

config IPX
	tristate "The IPX protocol"

	  want to access Novell NetWare file or print servers using the Linux
	  Novell client ncpfs (available from
	  <ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/ncpfs/>) or from
	  within the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>).  In order
	  to do the former, you'll also have to say Y to "NCP file system
	  support", below.

	  IPX is similar in scope to IP, while SPX, which runs on top of IPX,
	  is similar to TCP. There is also experimental support for SPX in
	  Linux (see "SPX networking", below).

	  To turn your Linux box into a fully featured NetWare file server and

config X25
	tristate "CCITT X.25 Packet Layer (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  X.25 is a set of standardized network protocols, similar in scope to
	  frame relay; the one physical line from your box to the X.25 network
	  entry point can carry several logical point-to-point connections
	  (called "virtual circuits") to other computers connected to the X.25
	  network. Governments, banks, and other organizations tend to use it
	  to connect to each other or to form Wide Area Networks (WANs). Many
	  countries have public X.25 networks. X.25 consists of two
	  protocols: the higher level Packet Layer Protocol (PLP) (say Y here
	  if you want that) and the lower level data link layer protocol LAPB
	  (say Y to "LAPB Data Link Driver" below if you want that).

	  You can read more about X.25 at <http://www.sangoma.com/x25.htm> and

	  <file:Documentation/networking/x25-iface.txt>.

	  One connects to an X.25 network either with a dedicated network card
	  using the X.21 protocol (not yet supported by Linux) or one can do
	  X.25 over a standard telephone line using an ordinary modem (say Y

	  The Frame Diverter allows you to divert packets from the

	  with the Frames Diverter on, can do some *really* transparent www
	  caching using a Squid proxy for example.

	  This is very useful when you don't want to change your router's

	  As an alternative, WAN routing can be built into the Linux kernel.
	  With relatively inexpensive WAN interface cards available on the

	---help---
	  When the kernel has several packets to send out over a network
	  device, it has to decide which ones to send first, which ones to
	  delay, and which ones to drop. This is the job of the packet
	  scheduler, and several different algorithms for how to do this
	  "fairly" have been proposed.

	  If you say N here, you will get the standard packet scheduler, which
	  is a FIFO (first come, first served). If you say Y here, you will be
	  able to choose from among several alternative algorithms which can
	  then be attached to different network devices. This is useful for
	  example if some of your network devices are real time devices that
	  need a certain minimum data flow rate, or if you need to limit the
	  maximum data flow rate for traffic which matches specified criteria.
	  This code is considered to be experimental.

	  To administer these schedulers, you'll need the user-level utilities
	  from the package iproute2+tc at <ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/net/ip-routing/>.
	  That package also contains some documentation; for more, check out
