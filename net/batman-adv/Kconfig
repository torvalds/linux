          B.A.T.M.A.N. (better approach to mobile ad-hoc networking) is
          a routing protocol for multi-hop ad-hoc mesh networks. The
          networks may be wired or wireless. See
          http://www.open-mesh.org/ for more information and user space
          tools.

config BATMAN_ADV_BLA
	bool "Bridge Loop Avoidance"
	depends on BATMAN_ADV && INET
	default y
	help
	  This option enables BLA (Bridge Loop Avoidance), a mechanism
	  to avoid Ethernet frames looping when mesh nodes are connected
	  to both the same LAN and the same mesh. If you will never use
	  more than one mesh node in the same LAN, you can safely remove
	  this feature and save some space.

config BATMAN_ADV_DAT
	bool "Distributed ARP Table"
	depends on BATMAN_ADV && INET
	default n
	help
	  This option enables DAT (Distributed ARP Table), a DHT based
	  mechanism that increases ARP reliability on sparse wireless
	  mesh networks. If you think that your network does not need
	  this option you can safely remove it and save some space.

config BATMAN_ADV_NC
	bool "Network Coding"
	depends on BATMAN_ADV
	default n
	help
	  This option enables network coding, a mechanism that aims to
	  increase the overall network throughput by fusing multiple
	  packets in one transmission.
	  Note that interfaces controlled by batman-adv must be manually
	  configured to have promiscuous mode enabled in order to make
	  network coding work.
	  If you think that your network does not need this feature you
	  can safely disable it and save some space.

config BATMAN_ADV_DEBUG
	bool "B.A.T.M.A.N. debugging"
	depends on BATMAN_ADV
	help
	  This is an option for use by developers; most people should
	  say N here. This enables compilation of support for
	  outputting debugging information to the kernel log. The
	  output is controlled via the module parameter debug.
