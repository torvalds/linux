	  IP Virtual Server support will let you build a high-performance
	  virtual server based on cluster of two or more real servers. This
	  option must be enabled for at least one of the clustered computers
	  that will take care of intercepting incoming connections to a
	  single IP address and scheduling them to real servers.

	  Three request dispatching techniques are implemented, they are
	  virtual server via NAT, virtual server via tunneling and virtual
	  server via direct routing. The several scheduling algorithms can
	  be used to choose which server the connection is directed to,
	  thus load balancing can be achieved among the servers.  For more
	  information and its administration program, please visit the
	  following URL: <http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/>.

	  If you want to compile it in kernel, say Y. To compile it as a
	  module, choose M here. If unsure, say N.

	  Say Y here if you want to get additional messages useful in

config	IP_VS_TAB_BITS
	int "IPVS connection table size (the Nth power of 2)"
	range 8 20 if !64BIT
	range 8 27 if 64BIT
	default 12
	help
	  The IPVS connection hash table uses the chaining scheme to handle
	  hash collisions. Using a big IPVS connection hash table will greatly
	  reduce conflicts when there are hundreds of thousands of connections
	  in the hash table.

	  Note the table size must be power of 2. The table size will be the
	  value of 2 to the your input number power. The number to choose is
	  from 8 to 27 for 64BIT(20 otherwise), the default number is 12,
	  which means the table size is 4096. Don't input the number too
	  small, otherwise you will lose performance on it. You can adapt the
	  table size yourself, according to your virtual server application.
	  It is good to set the table size not far less than the number of
	  connections per second multiplying average lasting time of
	  connection in the table.  For example, your virtual server gets 200
	  connections per second, the connection lasts for 200 seconds in
	  average in the connection table, the table size should be not far
	  less than 200x200, it is good to set the table size 32768 (2**15).

	  Another note that each connection occupies 128 bytes effectively and
	  each hash entry uses 8 bytes, so you can estimate how much memory is
	  needed for your box.

	  You can overwrite this number setting conn_tab_bits module parameter
	  or by appending ip_vs.conn_tab_bits=? to the kernel command line if
	  IP VS was compiled built-in.

config	IP_VS_LBLC
	tristate "locality-based least-connection scheduling"
	help
	  The locality-based least-connection scheduling algorithm is for
	  destination IP load balancing. It is usually used in cache cluster.
	  This algorithm usually directs packet destined for an IP address to
	  its server if the server is alive and under load. If the server is
	  overloaded (its active connection numbers is larger than its weight)
	  and there is a server in its half load, then allocate the weighted
	  least-connection server to this IP address.

config  IP_VS_LBLCR

	help
	  The locality-based least-connection with replication scheduling
	  algorithm is also for destination IP load balancing. It is 
	  usually used in cache cluster. It differs from the LBLC scheduling
	  as follows: the load balancer maintains mappings from a target
	  to a set of server nodes that can serve the target. Requests for
	  a target are assigned to the least-connection node in the target's
	  server set. If all the node in the server set are over loaded,
	  it picks up a least-connection node in the cluster and adds it
	  in the sever set for the target. If the server set has not been
	  modified for the specified time, the most loaded node is removed
	  from the server set, in order to avoid high degree of replication.

config	IP_VS_MH
	tristate "maglev hashing scheduling"
	help
	  The maglev consistent hashing scheduling algorithm provides the
	  Google's Maglev hashing algorithm as a IPVS scheduler. It assigns
	  network connections to the servers through looking up a statically
	  assigned special hash table called the lookup table. Maglev hashing
	  is to assign a preference list of all the lookup table positions
	  to each destination.

	  Through this operation, The maglev hashing gives an almost equal
	  share of the lookup table to each of the destinations and provides
	  minimal disruption by using the lookup table. When the set of
	  destinations changes, a connection will likely be sent to the same
	  destination as it was before.

config	IP_VS_SED
	tristate "shortest expected delay scheduling"
	help
	  The shortest expected delay scheduling algorithm assigns network
	  connections to the server with the shortest expected delay. The 
	  expected delay that the job will experience is (Ci + 1) / Ui if 
	  sent to the ith server, in which Ci is the number of connections
	  on the ith server and Ui is the fixed service rate (weight)

	  The never queue scheduling algorithm adopts a two-speed model.
	  When there is an idle server available, the job will be sent to
	  the idle server, instead of waiting for a fast one. When there
	  is no idle server available, the job will be sent to the server
	  that minimize its expected delay (The Shortest Expected Delay
	  scheduling algorithm).

	help
	  The source hashing scheduler maps source IPs to destinations

	  until all slots in the table are filled. When using weights to
	  allow destinations to receive more connections, the table is
