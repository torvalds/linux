	depends on NETFILTER_NETLINK
	help
	  If this option is enabled, the kernel will include support
	  for logging packets via NFNETLINK.

	  This obsoletes the existing ipt_ULOG and ebg_ulog mechanisms,

	  and ip6t_LOG modules.

config NF_CONNTRACK

	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && IP_NF_CONNTRACK=n
	default n
	---help---
	  Connection tracking keeps a record of what packets have passed
	  through your machine, in order to figure out how they are related
	  into connections.

	  Layer 3 independent connection tracking is experimental scheme
	  which generalize ip_conntrack to support other layer 3 protocols.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NF_CT_ACCT
	bool "Connection tracking flow accounting"
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK
	help
	  If this option is enabled, the connection tracking code will

	  `connbytes' match.

	  If unsure, say `N'.

config NF_CONNTRACK_MARK
	bool  'Connection mark tracking support'
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK
	help
	  This option enables support for connection marks, used by the
	  `CONNMARK' target and `connmark' match. Similar to the mark value
	  of packets, but this mark value is kept in the conntrack session
	  instead of the individual packets.

config NF_CONNTRACK_EVENTS
	bool "Connection tracking events (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && NF_CONNTRACK

config NF_CONNTRACK_FTP
	tristate "FTP support on new connection tracking (EXPERIMENTAL)"

	help
	  This option adds a `MARK' target, which allows you to create rules
	  in the `mangle' table which alter the netfilter mark (nfmark) field
	  associated with the packet prior to routing. This can change
	  the routing method (see `Use netfilter MARK value as routing
	  key') and can also be used by other subsystems to change their
