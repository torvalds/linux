config NETFILTER_NETLINK
       tristate "Netfilter netlink interface"
       help
         If this option is enabled, the kernel will include support
         for the new netfilter netlink interface.

config NETFILTER_NETLINK_QUEUE
	tristate "Netfilter NFQUEUE over NFNETLINK interface"
	depends on NETFILTER_NETLINK
	help
	  If this option isenabled, the kernel will include support
	  for queueing packets via NFNETLINK.
	  
config NETFILTER_NETLINK_LOG
	tristate "Netfilter LOG over NFNETLINK interface"
	depends on NETFILTER_NETLINK
	help
	  If this option is enabled, the kernel will include support
	  for logging packets via NFNETLINK.

	  This obsoletes the existing ipt_ULOG and ebg_ulog mechanisms,
	  and is also scheduled to replace the old syslog-based ipt_LOG
	  and ip6t_LOG modules.

config NF_CONNTRACK
	tristate "Layer 3 Independent Connection tracking (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && IP_NF_CONNTRACK=n
	default n
	---help---
	  Connection tracking keeps a record of what packets have passed
	  through your machine, in order to figure out how they are related
	  into connections.

	  Layer 3 independent connection tracking is experimental scheme
	  which generalize ip_conntrack to support other layer 3 protocols.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NF_CT_ACCT
	bool "Connection tracking flow accounting"
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK
	help
	  If this option is enabled, the connection tracking code will
	  keep per-flow packet and byte counters.

	  Those counters can be used for flow-based accounting or the
	  `connbytes' match.

	  If unsure, say `N'.

config NF_CONNTRACK_MARK
	bool  'Connection mark tracking support'
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK
	help
	  This option enables support for connection marks, used by the
	  `CONNMARK' target and `connmark' match. Similar to the mark value
	  of packets, but this mark value is kept in the conntrack session
	  instead of the individual packets.

config NF_CONNTRACK_EVENTS
	bool "Connection tracking events"
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK
	help
	  If this option is enabled, the connection tracking code will
	  provide a notifier chain that can be used by other kernel code
	  to get notified aboutchanges in the connection tracking state.

	  If unsure, say `N'.

config NF_CT_PROTO_SCTP
	tristate 'SCTP protocol on new connection tracking support (EXPERIMENTAL)'
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && NF_CONNTRACK
	default n
	help
	  With this option enabled, the layer 3 independent connection
	  tracking code will be able to do state tracking on SCTP connections.

	  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
	  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

config NF_CONNTRACK_FTP
	tristate "FTP support on new connection tracking (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && NF_CONNTRACK
	help
	  Tracking FTP connections is problematic: special helpers are
	  required for tracking them, and doing masquerading and other forms
	  of Network Address Translation on them.

	  This is FTP support on Layer 3 independent connection tracking.
	  Layer 3 independent connection tracking is experimental scheme
	  which generalize ip_conntrack to support other layer 3 protocols.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
