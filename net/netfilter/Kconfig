	  normally be used in conjunction with the SECMARK target.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

	  This option adds a `DSCP' target, which allows you to manipulate
	  the IPv4/IPv6 header DSCP field (differentiated services codepoint).

	  The DSCP field can have any value between 0x0 and 0x3f inclusive.

	  It also adds the "TOS" target, which allows you to create rules in
	  the "mangle" table which alter the Type Of Service field of an IPv4
	  or the Priority field of an IPv6 packet, prior to routing.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

	hoplimit/time-to-live value of the IP header.

	While it is safe to decrement the hoplimit/TTL value, the
	modules also allow to increment and set the hoplimit value of
	the header to arbitrary values. This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS

	This option adds the "HMARK" target.

	The target allows you to create rules in the "raw" and "mangle" tables
	which set the skbuff mark by means of hash calculation within a given
	range. The nfmark can influence the routing method and can also be used

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_LED
	tristate '"LED" target support'

	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	help
	  This option adds a `LED' target, which allows you to blink LEDs in
	  response to particular packets passing through your machine.

	  This can be used to turn a spare LED into a network activity LED,
	  which only flashes in response to FTP transfers, for example.  Or
	  you could have an LED which lights up for a minute or two every time
	  somebody connects to your machine via SSH.

	  You will need support for the "led" class to make this work.

	  To create an LED trigger for incoming SSH traffic:
	    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j LED --led-trigger-id ssh --led-delay 1000

	  Then attach the new trigger to an LED on your system:
	    echo netfilter-ssh > /sys/class/leds/<ledname>/trigger

	  For more information on the LEDs available on your system, see

	  to redirect traffic to a transparent proxy.  It does _not_ depend
	  on Netfilter connection tracking and NAT, unlike REDIRECT.
	  For it to work you will have to configure certain iptables rules

	---help---
	  This option adds a `TCPMSS' target, which allows you to alter the
	  MSS value of TCP SYN packets, to control the maximum size for that
	  connection (usually limiting it to your outgoing interface's MTU
	  minus 40).

	  This is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers which
	  block ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets.  The symptoms of this
	  problem are that everything works fine from your Linux
	  firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large
	  packets:
	        1) Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.
	        2) Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
	        3) ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.

	  Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
	  configuration like:

	  iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN \
	                 -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu

	  This option allows you to build work-load-sharing clusters of
	  network servers/stateful firewalls without having a dedicated
	  load-balancing router/server/switch. Basically, this match returns

	help
	  This option adds a `rateest' match, which allows to match on the
	  rate estimated by the RATEEST target.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_REALM
	tristate  '"realm" match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	select IP_ROUTE_CLASSID
	help
	  This option adds a `realm' match, which allows you to use the realm
	  key from the routing subsystem inside iptables.

	  This match pretty much resembles the CONFIG_NET_CLS_ROUTE4 option 
	  in tc world.

	  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

config NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_RECENT
	tristate '"recent" match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	---help---
	This match is used for creating one or many lists of recently
	used addresses and then matching against that/those list(s).

	Short options are available by using 'iptables -m recent -h'
	Official Website: <http://snowman.net/projects/ipt_recent/>

config NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_SCTP
	tristate  '"sctp" protocol match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	default IP_SCTP
	help
	  With this option enabled, you will be able to use the 
	  `sctp' match in order to match on SCTP source/destination ports
	  and SCTP chunk types.

	  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

config NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_SOCKET
	tristate '"socket" match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_XTABLES
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	depends on IPV6 || IPV6=n
	depends on IP6_NF_IPTABLES || IP6_NF_IPTABLES=n
	select NF_SOCKET_IPV4
	select NF_SOCKET_IPV6 if IP6_NF_IPTABLES
	select NF_DEFRAG_IPV4
	select NF_DEFRAG_IPV6 if IP6_NF_IPTABLES != n
	help
	  This option adds a `socket' match, which can be used to match
	  packets for which a TCP or UDP socket lookup finds a valid socket.
	  It can be used in combination with the MARK target and policy
	  routing to implement full featured non-locally bound sockets.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_STATE
	tristate '"state" match support'
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	help
	  Connection state matching allows you to match packets based on their
	  relationship to a tracked connection (ie. previous packets).  This
	  is a powerful tool for packet classification.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_STATISTIC
	tristate '"statistic" match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	help
	  This option adds a `statistic' match, which allows you to match
	  on packets periodically or randomly with a given percentage.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_STRING
	tristate  '"string" match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	select TEXTSEARCH
	select TEXTSEARCH_KMP
	select TEXTSEARCH_BM
	select TEXTSEARCH_FSM
	help
	  This option adds a `string' match, which allows you to look for
	  pattern matchings in packets.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_TCPMSS
	tristate '"tcpmss" match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	help
	  This option adds a `tcpmss' match, which allows you to examine the
	  MSS value of TCP SYN packets, which control the maximum packet size
	  for that connection.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_TIME
	tristate '"time" match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	---help---
	  This option adds a "time" match, which allows you to match based on
	  the packet arrival time (at the machine which netfilter is running)
	  on) or departure time/date (for locally generated packets).

	  If you say Y here, try `iptables -m time --help` for
	  more information.

	  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here.
	  If unsure, say N.

config NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_U32
	tristate '"u32" match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	---help---
	  u32 allows you to extract quantities of up to 4 bytes from a packet,
	  AND them with specified masks, shift them by specified amounts and
	  test whether the results are in any of a set of specified ranges.
	  The specification of what to extract is general enough to skip over
	  headers with lengths stored in the packet, as in IP or TCP header
	  lengths.

	  Details and examples are in the kernel module source.
