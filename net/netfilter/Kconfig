config NETFILTER_NETLINK
       tristate "Netfilter netlink interface"
       help
         If this option is enabled, the kernel will include support
         for the new netfilter netlink interface.

config NETFILTER_NETLINK_QUEUE
	tristate "Netfilter NFQUEUE over NFNETLINK interface"
	depends on NETFILTER_NETLINK
	help
	  If this option is enabled, the kernel will include support
	  for queueing packets via NFNETLINK.
	  
config NETFILTER_NETLINK_LOG
	tristate "Netfilter LOG over NFNETLINK interface"
	depends on NETFILTER_NETLINK
	help
	  If this option is enabled, the kernel will include support
	  for logging packets via NFNETLINK.

	  This obsoletes the existing ipt_ULOG and ebg_ulog mechanisms,
	  and is also scheduled to replace the old syslog-based ipt_LOG
	  and ip6t_LOG modules.

config NF_CONNTRACK
	tristate "Layer 3 Independent Connection tracking (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && IP_NF_CONNTRACK=n
	default n
	---help---
	  Connection tracking keeps a record of what packets have passed
	  through your machine, in order to figure out how they are related
	  into connections.

	  Layer 3 independent connection tracking is experimental scheme
	  which generalize ip_conntrack to support other layer 3 protocols.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NF_CT_ACCT
	bool "Connection tracking flow accounting"
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK
	help
	  If this option is enabled, the connection tracking code will
	  keep per-flow packet and byte counters.

	  Those counters can be used for flow-based accounting or the
	  `connbytes' match.

	  If unsure, say `N'.

config NF_CONNTRACK_MARK
	bool  'Connection mark tracking support'
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK
	help
	  This option enables support for connection marks, used by the
	  `CONNMARK' target and `connmark' match. Similar to the mark value
	  of packets, but this mark value is kept in the conntrack session
	  instead of the individual packets.

config NF_CONNTRACK_SECMARK
	bool  'Connection tracking security mark support'
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK && NETWORK_SECMARK
	help
	  This option enables security markings to be applied to
	  connections.  Typically they are copied to connections from
	  packets using the CONNSECMARK target and copied back from
	  connections to packets with the same target, with the packets
	  being originally labeled via SECMARK.

	  If unsure, say 'N'.

config NF_CONNTRACK_EVENTS
	bool "Connection tracking events (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && NF_CONNTRACK

config NF_CONNTRACK_FTP
	tristate "FTP support on new connection tracking (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && NF_CONNTRACK

	  Tracking FTP connections is problematic: special helpers are
	  required for tracking them, and doing masquerading and other forms
	  of Network Address Translation on them.

	  This is FTP support on Layer 3 independent connection tracking.
	  Layer 3 independent connection tracking is experimental scheme
	  which generalize ip_conntrack to support other layer 3 protocols.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_CLASSIFY
	tristate '"CLASSIFY" target support'
	depends on NETFILTER_XTABLES
	help
	  This option adds a `CLASSIFY' target, which enables the user to set

	help
	  This option adds a `CONNMARK' target, which allows one to manipulate
	  the connection mark value.  Similar to the MARK target, but
	  affects the connection mark value rather than the packet mark value.
	
	  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called

	help
	  This option adds a `MARK' target, which allows you to create rules
	  in the `mangle' table which alter the netfilter mark (nfmark) field
	  associated with the packet prior to routing. This can change
	  the routing method (see `Use netfilter MARK value as routing
	  key') and can also be used by other subsystems to change their
	  behavior.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_NFQUEUE
	tristate '"NFQUEUE" target Support'
	depends on NETFILTER_XTABLES

		    (IP_NF_CONNTRACK && IP_NF_CONNTRACK_SECMARK))
	help
	  The CONNSECMARK target copies security markings from packets
	  to connections, and restores security markings from connections
	  to packets (if the packets are not already marked).  This would
	  normally be used in conjunction with the SECMARK target.
