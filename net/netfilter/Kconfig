	This option adds the "MARK" target and "mark" match.

	Netfilter mark matching allows you to match packets based on the
	"nfmark" value in the packet.
	The target allows you to create rules in the "mangle" table which alter
	the netfilter mark (nfmark) field associated with the packet.

	Prior to routing, the nfmark can influence the routing method (see
	"Use netfilter MARK value as routing key") and can also be used by

	  The DSCP field can have any value between 0x0 and 0x3f inclusive.

	  It also adds the "TOS" target, which allows you to create rules in

	  or the Priority field of an IPv6 packet, prior to routing.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

	  This can be used to turn a spare LED into a network activity LED,
	  which only flashes in response to FTP transfers, for example.  Or
	  you could have an LED which lights up for a minute or two every time
	  somebody connects to your machine via SSH.

	  You will need support for the "led" class to make this work.

	  To create an LED trigger for incoming SSH traffic:
	    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j LED --led-trigger-id ssh --led-delay 1000

	  Then attach the new trigger to an LED on your system:

	  connection (usually limiting it to your outgoing interface's MTU
	  minus 40).

	  This is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers which
	  block ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets.  The symptoms of this

	        2) Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
	        3) ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.

	  Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
	  configuration like:
