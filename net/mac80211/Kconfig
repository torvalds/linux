	  This option selects the default rate control algorithm
	  mac80211 will use. Note that this default can still be
	  overriden through the ieee80211_default_rc_algo module
	  parameter if different algorithms are available.

	---help---
	  This option is recommended for driver authors and strongly
	  discouraged for everybody else, it will trigger a warning
	  when a driver hands mac80211 a buffer that is aligned in
	  a way that will cause problems with the IP stack on some
	  architectures.

	  Say N unless you're writing a mac80211 based driver.

config MAC80211_NOINLINE
	bool "Do not inline TX/RX handlers"

	---help---
	  This option affects code generation in mac80211, when
	  selected some functions are marked "noinline" to allow
	  easier debugging of problems in the transmit and receive
	  paths.

	  This option increases code size a bit and inserts a lot
	  of function calls in the code, but is otherwise safe to
	  enable.

	  If unsure, say N unless you expect to be finding problems
	  in mac80211.

config MAC80211_VERBOSE_DEBUG
	bool "Verbose debugging output"
	depends on MAC80211_DEBUG_MENU
	---help---
	  Selecting this option causes mac80211 to print out
