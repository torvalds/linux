config IEEE80211
	tristate "Generic IEEE 802.11 Networking Stack (DEPRECATED)"
	---help---
	This option enables the hardware independent IEEE 802.11
	networking stack.  This component is deprecated in favor of the
	mac80211 component.

config IEEE80211_DEBUG
	bool "Enable full debugging output"
	depends on IEEE80211
	---help---
	  This option will enable debug tracing output for the
	  ieee80211 network stack.

	  This will result in the kernel module being ~70k larger.  You
	  can control which debug output is sent to the kernel log by
	  setting the value in

	  /proc/net/ieee80211/debug_level

	  For example:

	  % echo 0x00000FFO > /proc/net/ieee80211/debug_level

	  For a list of values you can assign to debug_level, you
	  can look at the bit mask values in <net/ieee80211.h>

	  If you are not trying to debug or develop the ieee80211
	  subsystem, you most likely want to say N here.

	depends on IEEE80211
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_ARC4

	---help---
	Include software based cipher suites in support of IEEE
	802.11's WEP.  This is needed for WEP as well as 802.1x.

	This can be compiled as a module and it will be called
	"ieee80211_crypt_wep".

	tristate "IEEE 802.11i CCMP support"
	depends on IEEE80211
	select CRYPTO
	select CRYPTO_AES
	---help---
	Include software based cipher suites in support of IEEE 802.11i
	(aka TGi, WPA, WPA2, WPA-PSK, etc.) for use with CCMP enabled
	networks.

	This can be compiled as a module and it will be called
	"ieee80211_crypt_ccmp".

	---help---
	Include software based cipher suites in support of IEEE 802.11i
	(aka TGi, WPA, WPA2, WPA-PSK, etc.) for use with TKIP enabled
	networks.

	This can be compiled as a module and it will be called
