config BRIDGE_EBT_BROUTE
	tristate "ebt: broute table support"
	help
	  The ebtables broute table is used to define rules that decide between
	  bridging and routing frames, giving Linux the functionality of a
	  brouter. See the man page for ebtables(8) and examples on the ebtables
	  website.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config BRIDGE_EBT_T_FILTER
	tristate "ebt: filter table support"
	help
	  The ebtables filter table is used to define frame filtering rules at
	  local input, forwarding and local output. See the man page for
	  ebtables(8).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config BRIDGE_EBT_T_NAT
	tristate "ebt: nat table support"
	help
	  The ebtables nat table is used to define rules that alter the MAC
	  source address (MAC SNAT) or the MAC destination address (MAC DNAT).
	  See the man page for ebtables(8).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config BRIDGE_EBT_LIMIT
	tristate "ebt: limit match support"
	help
	  This option adds the limit match, which allows you to control
	  the rate at which a rule can be matched. This match is the
	  equivalent of the iptables limit match.

	  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

config BRIDGE_EBT_MARK
	tristate "ebt: mark filter support"
	help
	  This option adds the mark match, which allows matching frames based on
	  the 'nfmark' value in the frame. This can be set by the mark target.
	  This value is the same as the one used in the iptables mark match and
	  target.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config BRIDGE_EBT_PKTTYPE
	tristate "ebt: packet type filter support"
	help
	  This option adds the packet type match, which allows matching on the
