	  Choose Y or M here to include cephlib, which provides the

	  If you say Y here, debug output will include a filename and
	  line to aid debugging.  This increases kernel size and slows
	  execution slightly when debug call sites are enabled (e.g.,
	  via CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG).

	  If unsure, say N.

	  If you say Y here, hostnames (e.g. monitor addresses) will
	  be resolved using the CONFIG_DNS_RESOLVER facility.
