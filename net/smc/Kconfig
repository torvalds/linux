	  SMC-R provides a "sockets over RDMA" solution making use of
	  RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) technology to upgrade
	  AF_INET TCP connections transparently.
	  The Linux implementation of the SMC-R solution is designed as

	  SMC_HS_CTRL_BPF enables support to register generic eBPF hook for SMC
	  handshake flow, which offer much greater flexibility in modifying the behavior
	  of the SMC protocol stack compared to a complete kernel-based approach. Select
	  this option if you want filtring the handshake process via eBPF programs.
