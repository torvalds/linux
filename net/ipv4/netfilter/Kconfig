	---help---
	  Connection tracking keeps a record of what packets have passed
	  through your machine, in order to figure out how they are related
	  into connections.

	  This is required to do Masquerading or other kinds of Network
	  Address Translation (except for Fast NAT).  It can also be used to

config IP_NF_IRC
	tristate "IRC protocol support"
	depends on IP_NF_CONNTRACK
	---help---
	  There is a commonly-used extension to IRC called
	  Direct Client-to-Client Protocol (DCC).  This enables users to send
	  files to each other, and also chat to each other without the need
	  of a server.  DCC Sending is used anywhere you send files over IRC,
	  and DCC Chat is most commonly used by Eggdrop bots.  If you are
	  using NAT, this extension will enable you to send files and initiate
	  chats.  Note that you do NOT need this extension to get files or
	  have others initiate chats, or everything else in IRC.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say Y.

config IP_NF_NETBIOS_NS
	tristate "NetBIOS name service protocol support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on IP_NF_CONNTRACK && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  NetBIOS name service requests are sent as broadcast messages from an
	  unprivileged port and responded to with unicast messages to the
	  same port. This make them hard to firewall properly because connection
	  tracking doesn't deal with broadcasts. This helper tracks locally
	  originating NetBIOS name service requests and the corresponding
	  responses. It relies on correct IP address configuration, specifically
	  netmask and broadcast address. When properly configured, the output
	  of "ip address show" should look similar to this:

	  $ ip -4 address show eth0
	  4: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000

	  than silently being dropped.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_LOG
	tristate "LOG target support"
	depends on IP_NF_IPTABLES
	help
	  This option adds a `LOG' target, which allows you to create rules in

config IP_NF_TARGET_ULOG
	tristate "ULOG target support"
	depends on IP_NF_IPTABLES

	  This option enables the old IPv4-only "ipt_ULOG" implementation
	  which has been obsoleted by the new "nfnetlink_log" code (see
	  CONFIG_NETFILTER_NETLINK_LOG).

	  This option adds a `ULOG' target, which allows you to create rules in
	  any iptables table. The packet is passed to a userspace logging
	  daemon using netlink multicast sockets; unlike the LOG target
	  which can only be viewed through syslog.

	  The appropriate userspace logging daemon (ulogd) may be obtained from
	  <http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd/>

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_TCPMSS
	tristate "TCPMSS target support"
	depends on IP_NF_IPTABLES
	---help---
	  This option adds a `TCPMSS' target, which allows you to alter the
	  MSS value of TCP SYN packets, to control the maximum size for that
	  connection (usually limiting it to your outgoing interface's MTU
	  minus 40).

	  This is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers which
	  block ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets.  The symptoms of this
	  problem are that everything works fine from your Linux
	  firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large
	  packets:
	  	1) Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.
	  	2) Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
	  	3) ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.

	  Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
	  configuration like:

	  iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN \
	  		 -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu

	help
	  Masquerading is a special case of NAT: all outgoing connections are
	  changed to seem to come from a particular interface's address, and
	  if the interface goes down, those connections are lost.  This is
	  only useful for dialup accounts with dynamic IP address (ie. your IP
	  address will be different on next dialup).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_REDIRECT
	tristate "REDIRECT target support"
	depends on IP_NF_NAT
	help
	  REDIRECT is a special case of NAT: all incoming connections are

	  come to the local machine instead of passing through.  This is
	  useful for transparent proxies.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_NETMAP
	tristate "NETMAP target support"
	depends on IP_NF_NAT
	help
	  NETMAP is an implementation of static 1:1 NAT mapping of network
	  addresses. It maps the network address part, while keeping the host
	  address part intact. It is similar to Fast NAT, except that
	  Netfilter's connection tracking doesn't work well with Fast NAT.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_SAME
	tristate "SAME target support"
	depends on IP_NF_NAT

config IP_NF_NAT_SNMP_BASIC
	tristate "Basic SNMP-ALG support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && IP_NF_NAT
	---help---

	  This module implements an Application Layer Gateway (ALG) for
	  SNMP payloads.  In conjunction with NAT, it allows a network
	  management system to access multiple private networks with
	  conflicting addresses.  It works by modifying IP addresses
	  inside SNMP payloads to match IP-layer NAT mapping.
