	tristate "IPv4 connection tracking support (required for NAT)"
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	select NF_DEFRAG_IPV4
	---help---
	  Connection tracking keeps a record of what packets have passed
	  through your machine, in order to figure out how they are related
	  into connections.

	  This is IPv4 support on Layer 3 independent connection tracking.
	  Layer 3 independent connection tracking is experimental scheme
	  which generalize ip_conntrack to support other layer 3 protocols.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NF_CONNTRACK_PROC_COMPAT
	bool "proc/sysctl compatibility with old connection tracking"
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK_PROCFS && NF_CONNTRACK_IPV4
	default y
	help
	  This option enables /proc and sysctl compatibility with the old
	  layer 3 dependent connection tracking. This is needed to keep
	  old programs that have not been adapted to the new names working.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config IP_NF_QUEUE
	tristate "IP Userspace queueing via NETLINK (OBSOLETE)"
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	help
	  Netfilter has the ability to queue packets to user space: the
	  netlink device can be used to access them using this driver.

	  This option enables the old IPv4-only "ip_queue" implementation
	  which has been obsoleted by the new "nfnetlink_queue" code (see
	  CONFIG_NETFILTER_NETLINK_QUEUE).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_IPTABLES
	tristate "IP tables support (required for filtering/masq/NAT)"
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	select NETFILTER_XTABLES
	help
	  iptables is a general, extensible packet identification framework.
	  The packet filtering and full NAT (masquerading, port forwarding,
	  etc) subsystems now use this: say `Y' or `M' here if you want to use
	  either of those.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

# The matches.
config IP_NF_MATCH_AH
	tristate '"ah" match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	help
	  This match extension allows you to match a range of SPIs
	  inside AH header of IPSec packets.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_MATCH_ECN
	tristate '"ecn" match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	select NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_ECN
	---help---
	This is a backwards-compat option for the user's convenience
	(e.g. when running oldconfig). It selects
	CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_ECN.

config IP_NF_MATCH_RPFILTER
	tristate '"rpfilter" reverse path filter match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	---help---
	  This option allows you to match packets whose replies would
	  go out via the interface the packet came in.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
	  The module will be called ipt_rpfilter.

config IP_NF_MATCH_TTL
	tristate '"ttl" match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	select NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_HL

# `filter', generic and specific targets
config IP_NF_FILTER
	tristate "Packet filtering"
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	help
	  Packet filtering defines a table `filter', which has a series of
	  rules for simple packet filtering at local input, forwarding and
	  local output.  See the man page for iptables(8).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_REJECT
	tristate "REJECT target support"
	depends on IP_NF_FILTER
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	help
	  The REJECT target allows a filtering rule to specify that an ICMP
	  error should be issued in response to an incoming packet, rather
	  than silently being dropped.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_LOG
	tristate "LOG target support"
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	help
	  This option adds a `LOG' target, which allows you to create rules in
	  any iptables table which records the packet header to the syslog.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_ULOG
	tristate "ULOG target support"
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	---help---

	  This option enables the old IPv4-only "ipt_ULOG" implementation
	  which has been obsoleted by the new "nfnetlink_log" code (see
	  CONFIG_NETFILTER_NETLINK_LOG).

	  This option adds a `ULOG' target, which allows you to create rules in
	  any iptables table. The packet is passed to a userspace logging
	  daemon using netlink multicast sockets; unlike the LOG target
	  which can only be viewed through syslog.

	  The appropriate userspace logging daemon (ulogd) may be obtained from
	  <http://www.netfilter.org/projects/ulogd/index.html>

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

# NAT + specific targets: nf_conntrack
config NF_NAT
	tristate "Full NAT"
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK_IPV4
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	help
	  The Full NAT option allows masquerading, port forwarding and other
	  forms of full Network Address Port Translation.  It is controlled by
	  the `nat' table in iptables: see the man page for iptables(8).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NF_NAT_NEEDED
	bool
	depends on NF_NAT
	default y

config IP_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE
	tristate "MASQUERADE target support"
	depends on NF_NAT
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	help
	  Masquerading is a special case of NAT: all outgoing connections are
	  changed to seem to come from a particular interface's address, and
	  if the interface goes down, those connections are lost.  This is
	  only useful for dialup accounts with dynamic IP address (ie. your IP
	  address will be different on next dialup).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_NETMAP
	tristate "NETMAP target support"
	depends on NF_NAT
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	help
	  NETMAP is an implementation of static 1:1 NAT mapping of network
	  addresses. It maps the network address part, while keeping the host
	  address part intact.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_REDIRECT
	tristate "REDIRECT target support"
	depends on NF_NAT
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	help
	  REDIRECT is a special case of NAT: all incoming connections are
	  mapped onto the incoming interface's address, causing the packets to
	  come to the local machine instead of passing through.  This is
	  useful for transparent proxies.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config NF_NAT_SNMP_BASIC
	tristate "Basic SNMP-ALG support"
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK_SNMP && NF_NAT
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	default NF_NAT && NF_CONNTRACK_SNMP
	---help---

	  This module implements an Application Layer Gateway (ALG) for
	  SNMP payloads.  In conjunction with NAT, it allows a network
	  management system to access multiple private networks with
	  conflicting addresses.  It works by modifying IP addresses
	  inside SNMP payloads to match IP-layer NAT mapping.

	  This is the "basic" form of SNMP-ALG, as described in RFC 2962

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

# mangle + specific targets
config IP_NF_MANGLE
	tristate "Packet mangling"
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	help
	  This option adds a `mangle' table to iptables: see the man page for
	  iptables(8).  This table is used for various packet alterations
	  which can effect how the packet is routed.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

	help
	  The CLUSTERIP target allows you to build load-balancing clusters of
	  network servers without having a dedicated load-balancing
	  router/server/switch.
	
	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_ECN
	tristate "ECN target support"
	depends on IP_NF_MANGLE
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	---help---
	  This option adds a `ECN' target, which can be used in the iptables mangle
	  table.  

	  You can use this target to remove the ECN bits from the IPv4 header of
	  an IP packet.  This is particularly useful, if you need to work around
	  existing ECN blackholes on the internet, but don't want to disable
	  ECN support in general.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_TTL

	CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_HL.

# raw + specific targets
config IP_NF_RAW
	tristate  'raw table support (required for NOTRACK/TRACE)'
	help
	  This option adds a `raw' table to iptables. This table is the very
	  first in the netfilter framework and hooks in at the PREROUTING
	  and OUTPUT chains.
	
	  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

# security table for MAC policy
