/* Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT (BBR) congestion control
 *
 * BBR congestion control computes the sending rate based on the delivery
 * rate (throughput) estimated from ACKs. In a nutshell:
 *
 *   On each ACK, update our model of the network path:
 *      bottleneck_bandwidth = windowed_max(delivered / elapsed, 10 round trips)
 *      min_rtt = windowed_min(rtt, 10 seconds)
 *   pacing_rate = pacing_gain * bottleneck_bandwidth
 *   cwnd = max(cwnd_gain * bottleneck_bandwidth * min_rtt, 4)
 *
 * The core algorithm does not react directly to packet losses or delays,
 * although BBR may adjust the size of next send per ACK when loss is
 * observed, or adjust the sending rate if it estimates there is a
 * traffic policer, in order to keep the drop rate reasonable.
 *
 * Here is a state transition diagram for BBR:
 *
 *             |
 *             V
 *    +---> STARTUP  ----+
 *    |        |         |
 *    |        V         |
 *    |      DRAIN   ----+
 *    |        |         |
 *    |        V         |
 *    +---> PROBE_BW ----+
 *    |      ^    |      |
 *    |      |    |      |
 *    |      +----+      |
 *    |                  |
 *    +---- PROBE_RTT <--+
 *
 * A BBR flow starts in STARTUP, and ramps up its sending rate quickly.
 * When it estimates the pipe is full, it enters DRAIN to drain the queue.
 * In steady state a BBR flow only uses PROBE_BW and PROBE_RTT.
 * A long-lived BBR flow spends the vast majority of its time remaining
 * (repeatedly) in PROBE_BW, fully probing and utilizing the pipe's bandwidth
 * in a fair manner, with a small, bounded queue. *If* a flow has been
 * continuously sending for the entire min_rtt window, and hasn't seen an RTT
 * sample that matches or decreases its min_rtt estimate for 10 seconds, then
 * it briefly enters PROBE_RTT to cut inflight to a minimum value to re-probe
 * the path's two-way propagation delay (min_rtt). When exiting PROBE_RTT, if
 * we estimated that we reached the full bw of the pipe then we enter PROBE_BW;
 * otherwise we enter STARTUP to try to fill the pipe.
 *
 * BBR is described in detail in:
 *   "BBR: Congestion-Based Congestion Control",
 *   Neal Cardwell, Yuchung Cheng, C. Stephen Gunn, Soheil Hassas Yeganeh,
 *   Van Jacobson. ACM Queue, Vol. 14 No. 5, September-October 2016.
 *
 * There is a public e-mail list for discussing BBR development and testing:
 *   https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bbr-dev
 *
 * NOTE: BBR might be used with the fq qdisc ("man tc-fq") with pacing enabled,
 * otherwise TCP stack falls back to an internal pacing using one high
 * resolution timer per TCP socket and may use more resources.
