	tristate "IPv6 connection tracking support"
	depends on INET && IPV6 && NF_CONNTRACK
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	select NF_DEFRAG_IPV6
	---help---
	  Connection tracking keeps a record of what packets have passed
	  through your machine, in order to figure out how they are related
	  into connections.

	  This is IPv6 support on Layer 3 independent connection tracking.
	  Layer 3 independent connection tracking is experimental scheme
	  which generalize ip_conntrack to support other layer 3 protocols.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

	tristate "IP6 tables support (required for filtering)"
	depends on INET && IPV6
	select NETFILTER_XTABLES
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	help
	  ip6tables is a general, extensible packet identification framework.
	  Currently only the packet filtering and packet mangling subsystem
	  for IPv6 use this, but connection tracking is going to follow.
	  Say 'Y' or 'M' here if you want to use either of those.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP6_NF_MATCH_OPTS
	tristate '"hbh" hop-by-hop and "dst" opts header match support'

	  and destination options headers of a packet.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP6_NF_MATCH_HL
	tristate '"hl" hoplimit match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	select NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_HL
	---help---

	(e.g. when running oldconfig). It selects
	CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_HL.

config IP6_NF_MATCH_IPV6HEADER
	tristate '"ipv6header" IPv6 Extension Headers Match'
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n

config IP6_NF_MATCH_RPFILTER
	tristate '"rpfilter" reverse path filter match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	---help---
	  This option allows you to match packets whose replies would
	  go out via the interface the packet came in.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.
	  The module will be called ip6t_rpfilter.

config IP6_NF_MATCH_RT
	tristate '"rt" Routing header match support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	help
	  rt matching allows you to match packets based on the routing
	  header of the packet.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

# The targets
config IP6_NF_TARGET_HL
	tristate '"HL" hoplimit target support'
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED && IP6_NF_MANGLE
	select NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_HL
	---help---
	This is a backwards-compatible option for the user's convenience
	(e.g. when running oldconfig). It selects
	CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_HL.

config IP6_NF_FILTER
	tristate "Packet filtering"
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	help
	  Packet filtering defines a table `filter', which has a series of
	  rules for simple packet filtering at local input, forwarding and
	  local output.  See the man page for iptables(8).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP6_NF_TARGET_REJECT
	tristate "REJECT target support"
	depends on IP6_NF_FILTER
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	help
	  The REJECT target allows a filtering rule to specify that an ICMPv6
	  error should be issued in response to an incoming packet, rather
	  than silently being dropped.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP6_NF_MANGLE
	tristate "Packet mangling"
	default m if NETFILTER_ADVANCED=n
	help
	  This option adds a `mangle' table to iptables: see the man page for
	  iptables(8).  This table is used for various packet alterations
	  which can effect how the packet is routed.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP6_NF_RAW
	tristate  'raw table support (required for TRACE)'
	help
	  This option adds a `raw' table to ip6tables. This table is the very
	  first in the netfilter framework and hooks in at the PREROUTING
	  and OUTPUT chains.

	  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

# security table for MAC policy
config IP6_NF_SECURITY
       tristate "Security table"
       depends on SECURITY
       depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
       help
         This option adds a `security' table to iptables, for use
         with Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policy.

config NF_NAT_IPV6
	tristate "IPv6 NAT"
	depends on NF_CONNTRACK_IPV6
	depends on NETFILTER_ADVANCED
	select NF_NAT
	help
	  The IPv6 NAT option allows masquerading, port forwarding and other
	  forms of full Network Address Port Translation. It is controlled by
	  the `nat' table in ip6tables, see the man page for ip6tables(8).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

if NF_NAT_IPV6

config IP6_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE
	tristate "MASQUERADE target support"
	help
	  Masquerading is a special case of NAT: all outgoing connections are
	  changed to seem to come from a particular interface's address, and
	  if the interface goes down, those connections are lost.  This is
	  only useful for dialup accounts with dynamic IP address (ie. your IP
	  address will be different on next dialup).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP6_NF_TARGET_NPT
	tristate "NPT (Network Prefix translation) target support"

	  This option adds the `SNPT' and `DNPT' target, which perform
	  stateless IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation per RFC 6296.
