	bool "IPv6: Privacy Extensions (RFC 3041) support"
	depends on IPV6
	---help---
	  Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6
	  support.  With this option, additional periodically-alter 
	  pseudo-random global-scope unicast address(es) will assigned to
	  your interface(s).
	
	  By default, kernel do not generate temporary addresses.
	  To use temporary addresses, do
	
	        echo 2 >/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/use_tempaddr 

	  See <file:Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt> for details.
