config AC97_BUS_NEW

	select AC97
	help
	  This is the new AC97 bus type, successor of AC97_BUS. The ported
	  drivers which benefit from the AC97 automatic probing should "select"
	  this instead of the AC97_BUS.
	  Say Y here if you want to have AC97 devices, which are sound oriented
	  devices around an AC-Link.

config AC97_BUS_COMPAT
	bool
	depends on AC97_BUS_NEW
	depends on !AC97_BUS
