          You will need firmware files in order to be able to use the device
          after it has been coldstarted. This driver currently does not support
          firmware loading for all devices. If you own such a device,
          you could start windows and let the windows driver upload
          the firmware. As long as you do not unplug your device from power,
          it should be usable.
