	  This option enables the I2S/TDM audio controller found in Sophgo
	  CV1800B / SG2002 SoCs. The controller supports standard I2S
	  audio modes for playback and capture.

	  The driver integrates with the ASoC framework and uses the DMA
	  engine for audio data transfer. It is intended to be configured
	  via Device Tree along with simple-audio-card module.

	  To compile the driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called cv1800b_tdm.

	depends on SND_SOC
	help
	  This driver provides an ASoC codec DAI for capture and basic
	  control of the RXADC registers.

	  Say Y or M to build support for the Sophgo CV1800B
	  internal analog ADC codec block (RXADC).
	  The module will be called cv1800b-sound-adc

	  This driver provides an ASoC codec DAI for playback and basic

	  Say Y or M to build support for the Sophgo CV1800B
	  internal analog DAC codec block (TXDAC).
