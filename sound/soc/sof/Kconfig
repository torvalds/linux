          This adds support for Sound Open Firmware (SOF). SOF is a free and
	  generic open source audio DSP firmware for multiple devices.
          Say Y if you have such a device that is supported by SOF.

config SND_SOC_SOF_NOCODEC
	tristate "SOF nocodec mode Support"
	help
          This adds support for a dummy/nocodec machine driver fallback
	  option if no known codec is detected. This is typically only
	  enabled for developers or devices where the sound card is
	  controlled externally
          Say Y if you need this nocodec fallback option
          If unsure select "N".

config SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG
	bool "SOF debugging features"

	  This option can be used to enable or disable individual SOF firmware
	  and driver debugging options.

	help
          This forces SOF to use dummy/nocodec as machine driver, even
	  though there is a codec detected on the real platform. This is
	  typically only enabled for developers for debug purposes, before
	  codec/machine driver is ready, or to exclude the impact of those
	  drivers
          Say Y if you need this force nocodec mode option
          If unsure select "N".

config SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG_XRUN_STOP
	bool "SOF stop on XRUN"
	help
	  This option forces PCMs to stop on any XRUN event. This is useful to
	  preserve any trace data ond pipeline status prior to the XRUN.
	  Say Y if you are debugging SOF FW pipeline XRUNs.
          If unsure select "N".

config SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG_VERBOSE_IPC
	bool "SOF verbose IPC logs"
	help
	  This option enables more verbose IPC logs, with command types in
	  human-readable form instead of just 32-bit hex dumps. This is useful
	  if you are trying to debug IPC with the DSP firmware.
          If unsure select "N".

config SND_SOC_SOF_DEBUG_FORCE_IPC_POSITION
	bool "SOF force to use IPC for position update on SKL+"
	help
	  This option force to handle stream position update IPCs and run pcm
	  elapse to inform ALSA about that, on platforms (e.g. Intel SKL+) that
	  with other approach (e.g. HDAC DPIB/posbuf) to elapse PCM.
	  On platforms (e.g. Intel SKL-) where position update IPC is the only
	  one choice, this setting won't impact anything.
	  if you are trying to debug pointer update with position IPCs or where
	  DPIB/posbuf is not ready, select "Y".
          If unsure select "N".
