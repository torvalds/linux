	  Note that in order to get those devices fully supported,  you have to
	  build  the kernel  with  standard  serial port  driver  included  and
	  configured for at least 4 ports.  Then, from userspace, you must load
	  a line discipline #19 on the modem (ttyS3) serial line.  The simplest
	  way to achieve this is to install util-linux-ng  and use the included
	  ldattach  utility.  This  can be  started  automatically  from  udev,
	  a simple rule like this one should do the trick (it does for me):
	  	ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="controlC0", \
				RUN+="/usr/sbin/ldattach 19 /dev/ttyS3"
