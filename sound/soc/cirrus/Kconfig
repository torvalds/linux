	  I2S controller on EP93xx seems to have undocumented HW issue.
	  Underflow of internal I2S controller FIFO could confuse the
	  state machine and the whole stream can be shifted by one byte
	  until I2S is disabled. This option enables IRQ based watchdog
	  which disables and re-enables I2S in case of underflow and
	  fills FIFO with zeroes.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer Y.
