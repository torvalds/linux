	  Say Y here if you want to use the Atmel AT73C213 external DAC. This
	  DAC can be found on Atmel development boards.

	  This driver requires the Atmel SSC driver for sound sink, a
	  peripheral found on most AT91 microprocessors.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called snd-at73c213.

	  Sets the target bitrate for the bitrate calculator in the driver.
	  Limited by hardware to be between 8000 Hz and 50000 Hz.

	  Set to 48000 Hz by default.
