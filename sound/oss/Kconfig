	  OSS is the Open Sound System suite of sound card drivers.  They make

config SOUND_DMAP
	bool "Persistent DMA buffers"
	---help---
	  Linux can often have problems allocating DMA buffers for ISA sound
	  cards on machines with more than 16MB of RAM. This is because ISA
	  DMA buffers must exist below the 16MB boundary and it is quite
	  possible that a large enough free block in this region cannot be
	  found after the machine has been running for a while. If you say Y
	  here the DMA buffers (64Kb) will be allocated at boot time and kept
	  until the shutdown. This option is only useful if you said Y to
	  "OSS sound modules", above. If you said M to "OSS sound modules"
	  then you can get the persistent DMA buffer functionality by passing
	  the command-line argument "dmabuf=1" to the sound module.

	  Say Y unless you have 16MB or more RAM or a PCI sound card.

config SOUND_MSS

	  Again think carefully before answering Y to this question.  It's
	  safe to answer Y if you have the original Windows Sound System card
	  made by Microsoft or Aztech SG 16 Pro (or NX16 Pro).  Also you may
	  say Y in case your card is NOT among these:

	  ATI Stereo F/X, AdLib, Audio Excell DSP16, Cardinal DSP16,
	  Ensoniq SoundScape (and compatibles made by Reveal and Spea),
	  Gravis Ultrasound, Gravis Ultrasound ACE, Gravis Ultrasound Max,

	  For cards having native support in VoxWare, consult the card
	  specific instructions in <file:Documentation/sound/oss/README.OSS>.
	  Some drivers have their own MSS support and saying Y to this option
	  will cause a conflict.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
	  "ad1848=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>[,<type>]" to the kernel command
	  line.

config SOUND_MPU401
	tristate "MPU-401 support (NOT for SB16)"
	---help---
	  Be careful with this question.  The MPU401 interface is supported by
	  all sound cards.  However, some natively supported cards have their
	  own driver for MPU401.  Enabling this MPU401 option with these cards
	  will cause a conflict.  Also, enabling MPU401 on a system that
	  doesn't really have a MPU401 could cause some trouble.  If your card
	  was in the list of supported cards, look at the card specific
	  instructions in the <file:Documentation/sound/oss/README.OSS> file.  It
	  is safe to answer Y if you have a true MPU401 MIDI interface card.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
	  "mpu401=<io>,<irq>" to the kernel command line.

config SOUND_PAS
	tristate "ProAudioSpectrum 16 support"
	---help---
	  Answer Y only if you have a Pro Audio Spectrum 16, ProAudio Studio
	  16 or Logitech SoundMan 16 sound card. Answer N if you have some
	  other card made by Media Vision or Logitech since those are not
	  PAS16 compatible. Please read <file:Documentation/sound/oss/PAS16>.
	  It is not necessary to add Sound Blaster support separately; it
	  is included in PAS support.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
	  "pas2=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>,<sbio>,<sbirq>,<sbdma>,<sbdma2>
	  to the kernel command line.

config PAS_JOYSTICK
	bool "Enable PAS16 joystick port"

	  ADSP-16 or some other card based on the PSS chipset (AD1848 codec +
	  ADSP-2115 DSP chip + Echo ESC614 ASIC CHIP). For more information on
	  how to compile it into the kernel or as a module see the file
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/PSS>.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
	  "pss=<io>,<mssio>,<mssirq>,<mssdma>,<mpuio>,<mpuirq>" to the kernel
	  command line.

config PSS_MIXER
	bool "Enable PSS mixer (Beethoven ADSP-16 and other compatible)"
	depends on SOUND_PSS
	help
	  Answer Y for Beethoven ADSP-16. You may try to say Y also for other
	  cards if they have master volume, bass, treble, and you can't
	  control it under Linux. If you answer N for Beethoven ADSP-16, you
	  can't control master volume, bass, treble and synth volume.

	  If you said M to "PSS support" above, you may enable or disable this
	  PSS mixer with the module parameter pss_mixer. For more information
	  see the file <file:Documentation/sound/oss/PSS>.

config PSS_HAVE_BOOT

config SOUND_SB

	---help---
	  Answer Y if you have an original Sound Blaster card made by Creative
	  Labs or a 100% hardware compatible clone (like the Thunderboard or
	  SM Games). For an unknown card you may answer Y if the card claims
	  to be Sound Blaster-compatible.

	  Please read the file <file:Documentation/sound/oss/Soundblaster>.

	  You should also say Y here for cards based on the Avance Logic
	  ALS-007 and ALS-1X0 chips (read <file:Documentation/sound/oss/ALS>) and
	  for cards based on ESS chips (read
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/ESS1868> and
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/ESS>). If you have an SB AWE 32 or SB AWE
	  64, say Y here and also to "AWE32 synth" below and read
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/INSTALL.awe>. If you have an IBM Mwave
	  card, say Y here and read <file:Documentation/sound/oss/mwave>.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel and don't want to use
	  isapnp, you have to add "sb=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>" to the kernel
	  command line.

	  You can say M here to compile this driver as a module; the module is
	  called sb.

config SOUND_YM3812
	tristate "Yamaha FM synthesizer (YM3812/OPL-3) support"
	---help---
	  Answer Y if your card has a FM chip made by Yamaha (OPL2/OPL3/OPL4).
	  Answering Y is usually a safe and recommended choice, however some
	  cards may have software (TSR) FM emulation. Enabling FM support with
	  these cards may cause trouble (I don't currently know of any such
	  cards, however). Please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/OPL3> if your card has an OPL3 chip.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
	  "opl3=<io>" to the kernel command line.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config SOUND_UART6850
	tristate "6850 UART support"
	help
	  This option enables support for MIDI interfaces based on the 6850
	  UART chip. This interface is rarely found on sound cards. It's safe
	  to answer N to this question.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
	  "uart6850=<io>,<irq>" to the kernel command line.

	tristate "Gallant Audio Cards (SC-6000 and SC-6600 based)"
	---help---

	  driver supports Audio Excel DSP 16 but not the III nor PnP versions
	  of this card.

	  The Gallant's Audio Excel DSP 16 card can emulate either an SBPro or
	  a Microsoft Sound System card, so you should have said Y to either
	  "100% Sound Blaster compatibles (SB16/32/64, ESS, Jazz16) support"
	  or "Microsoft Sound System support", above, and you need to answer
	  the "MSS emulation" and "SBPro emulation" questions below
	  accordingly. You should say Y to one and only one of these two
	  questions.

	  Read the <file:Documentation/sound/oss/README.OSS> file and the head of
