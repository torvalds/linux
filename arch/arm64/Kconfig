	  AXI master interface and an L2 cache.

	  If a Cortex-A53 uses an AMBA AXI4 ACE interface to other processors
	  and is unable to accept a certain write via this interface, it will
	  not progress on read data presented on the read data channel and the
	  system can deadlock.

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to

	  ARMv8 obsoletes the use of A32 SWP/SWPB instructions such that

	  In some older versions of glibc [<=2.8] SWP is used during futex

	  application.

	  NOTE: when accessing uncached shared regions, LDXR/STXR rely
