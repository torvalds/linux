	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 826319 on Cortex-A53 parts up to r0p2 with an AMBA 4 ACE or
	  AXI master interface and an L2 cache.

	  If a Cortex-A53 uses an AMBA AXI4 ACE interface to other processors
	  and is unable to accept a certain write via this interface, it will
	  not progress on read data presented on the read data channel and the
	  system can deadlock.

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to
	  data cache clean-and-invalidate.
	  Please note that this does not necessarily enable the workaround,
	  as it depends on the alternative framework, which will only patch
	  the kernel if an affected CPU is detected.

	  Under certain conditions this erratum can cause a clean line eviction
	  to occur at the same time as another transaction to the same address
	  on the AMBA 5 CHI interface, which can cause data corruption if the
	  interconnect reorders the two transactions.

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to

	  erratum 845719 on Cortex-A53 parts up to r0p4.

	  When running a compat (AArch32) userspace on an affected Cortex-A53
	  part, a load at EL0 from a virtual address that matches the bottom 32
	  bits of the virtual address used by a recent load at (AArch64) EL1
	  might return incorrect data.

	  The workaround is to write the contextidr_el1 register on exception
	  return to a 32-bit task.
	  Please note that this does not necessarily enable the workaround,

	  This option builds kernel modules using the large memory model in

	  ARMv8 obsoletes the use of A32 SWP/SWPB instructions such that

	  emulation of these instructions for userspace using LDXR/STXR.

	  In some older versions of glibc [<=2.8] SWP is used during futex
	  trylock() operations with the assumption that the code will not
	  be preempted. This invalid assumption may be more likely to fail
	  with SWP emulation enabled, leading to deadlock of the user
	  application.

	  NOTE: when accessing uncached shared regions, LDXR/STXR rely
	  on an external transaction monitoring block called a global

	  instructions instead.

	  Say Y here to enable software emulation of these

	  capable processors, accesses to pages with PTE_AF cleared will

	  Similarly, writes to read-only pages with the DBM bit set will
	  clear the read-only bit (AP[2]) instead of raising a

	 Privileged Access Never (PAN; part of the ARMv8.1 Extensions)

	 Choosing this option will cause any unprotected (not using

config ARM64_LSE_ATOMICS

	  Say Y here to make use of these instructions for the in-kernel
