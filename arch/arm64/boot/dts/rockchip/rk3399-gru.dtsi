	/*
	 * Power Tree
	 *
	 * In general an attempt is made to include all rails called out by
	 * the schematic as long as those rails interact in some way with
	 * the AP.  AKA:
	 * - Rails that only connect to the EC (or devices that the EC talks to)
	 *   are not included.
	 * - Rails _are_ included if the rails go to the AP even if the AP
	 *   doesn't currently care about them / they are always on.  The idea
	 *   here is that it makes it easier to map to the schematic or extend
	 *   later.
	 *
	 * If two rails are substantially the same from the AP's point of
	 * view, though, we won't create a full fixed regulator.  We'll just
	 * put the child rail as an alias of the parent rail.  Sometimes rails
	 * look the same to the AP because one of these is true:
	 * - The EC controls the enable and the EC always enables a rail as
	 *   long as the AP is running.
	 * - The rails are actually connected to each other by a jumper and
	 *   the distinction is just there to add clarity/flexibility to the
	 *   schematic.
