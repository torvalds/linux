 * The exception table consists of pairs of relative offsets: the first
 * is the relative offset to an instruction that is allowed to fault,
 * and the second is the relative offset at which the program should
 * continue. No registers are modified, so it is entirely up to the
 * continuation code to figure out what to do.
 *
 * All the routines below use bits of fixup code that are out of line
 * with the main instruction path.  This means when everything is well,
 * we don't even have to jump over them.  Further, they do not intrude
 * on our cache or tlb entries.
