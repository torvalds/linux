/*
 * CPU capabilities:
 *
 * We use arm64_cpu_capabilities to represent system features, errata work
 * arounds (both used internally by kernel and tracked in cpu_hwcaps) and
 * ELF HWCAPs (which are exposed to user).
 *
 * To support systems with heterogeneous CPUs, we need to make sure that we
 * detect the capabilities correctly on the system and take appropriate
 * measures to ensure there are no incompatibilities.
 *
 * This comment tries to explain how we treat the capabilities.
 * Each capability has the following list of attributes :
 *
 * 1) Scope of Detection : The system detects a given capability by
 *    performing some checks at runtime. This could be, e.g, checking the
 *    value of a field in CPU ID feature register or checking the cpu
 *    model. The capability provides a call back ( @matches() ) to
 *    perform the check. Scope defines how the checks should be performed.
 *    There are two cases:
 *
 *     a) SCOPE_LOCAL_CPU: check all the CPUs and "detect" if at least one
 *        matches. This implies, we have to run the check on all the
 *        booting CPUs, until the system decides that state of the
 *        capability is finalised. (See section 2 below)
 *		Or
 *     b) SCOPE_SYSTEM: check all the CPUs and "detect" if all the CPUs
 *        matches. This implies, we run the check only once, when the
 *        system decides to finalise the state of the capability. If the
 *        capability relies on a field in one of the CPU ID feature
 *        registers, we use the sanitised value of the register from the
 *        CPU feature infrastructure to make the decision.
 *
 *    The process of detection is usually denoted by "update" capability
 *    state in the code.
 *
 * 2) Finalise the state : The kernel should finalise the state of a
 *    capability at some point during its execution and take necessary
 *    actions if any. Usually, this is done, after all the boot-time
 *    enabled CPUs are brought up by the kernel, so that it can make
 *    better decision based on the available set of CPUs. However, there
 *    are some special cases, where the action is taken during the early
 *    boot by the primary boot CPU. (e.g, running the kernel at EL2 with
 *    Virtualisation Host Extensions). The kernel usually disallows any
 *    changes to the state of a capability once it finalises the capability
 *    and takes any action, as it may be impossible to execute the actions
 *    safely. A CPU brought up after a capability is "finalised" is
 *    referred to as "Late CPU" w.r.t the capability. e.g, all secondary
 *    CPUs are treated "late CPUs" for capabilities determined by the boot
 *    CPU.
 *
 * 3) Verification: When a CPU is brought online (e.g, by user or by the
 *    kernel), the kernel should make sure that it is safe to use the CPU,
 *    by verifying that the CPU is compliant with the state of the
 *    capabilities finalised already. This happens via :
 *
 *	secondary_start_kernel()-> check_local_cpu_capabilities()
 *
 *    As explained in (2) above, capabilities could be finalised at
 *    different points in the execution. Each CPU is verified against the
 *    "finalised" capabilities and if there is a conflict, the kernel takes
 *    an action, based on the severity (e.g, a CPU could be prevented from
 *    booting or cause a kernel panic). The CPU is allowed to "affect" the
 *    state of the capability, if it has not been finalised already.
 *
 * 4) Action: As mentioned in (2), the kernel can take an action for each
 *    detected capability, on all CPUs on the system. Appropriate actions
 *    include, turning on an architectural feature, modifying the control
 *    registers (e.g, SCTLR, TCR etc.) or patching the kernel via
 *    alternatives. The kernel patching is batched and performed at later
 *    point. The actions are always initiated only after the capability
 *    is finalised. This is usally denoted by "enabling" the capability.
 *    The actions are initiated as follows :
 *	a) Action is triggered on all online CPUs, after the capability is
 *	finalised, invoked within the stop_machine() context from
 *	enable_cpu_capabilitie().
 *
 *	b) Any late CPU, brought up after (1), the action is triggered via:
 *
 *	  check_local_cpu_capabilities() -> verify_local_cpu_capabilities()
 *
