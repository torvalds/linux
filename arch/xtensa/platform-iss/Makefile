# Makefile for the Xtensa Instruction Set Simulator (ISS)
# "prom monitor" library routines under Linux.
#
# Note! Dependencies are done automagically by 'make dep', which also
# removes any old dependencies. DON'T put your own dependencies here
# unless it's something special (ie not a .c file).
#
# Note 2! The CFLAGS definitions are in the main makefile...
