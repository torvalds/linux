	default y
	help
	  Earlier version initialized the MMU in the exception vector
	  before jumping to _startup in head.S and had an advantage that
	  it was possible to place a software breakpoint at 'reset' and
	  then enter your normal kernel breakpoints once the MMU was mapped
	  to the kernel mappings (0XC0000000).

	  This unfortunately doesn't work for U-Boot and likley also wont
	  work for using KEXEC to have a hot kernel ready for doing a
	  KDUMP.

	  So now the MMU is initialized in head.S but it's necessary to
	  use hardware breakpoints (gdb 'hbreak' cmd) to break at _startup.
	  xt-gdb can't place a Software Breakpoint in the  0XD region prior
	  to mapping the MMU and after mapping even if the area of low memory
	  was mapped gdb wouldn't remove the breakpoint on hitting it as the
	  PC wouldn't match. Since Hardware Breakpoints are recommended for
	  Linux configurations it seems reasonable to just assume they exist
	  and leave this older mechanism for unfortunate souls that choose
	  not to follow Tensilica's recommendation.

	  Selecting this will cause U-Boot to set the KERNEL Load and Entry
	  address at 0x00003000 instead of the mapped std of 0xD0003000.

	  If in doubt, say Y.
