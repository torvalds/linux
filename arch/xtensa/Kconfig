	default y if XTENSA_VARIANT_DC233C || XTENSA_VARIANT_CUSTOM
	help
	  Earlier version initialized the MMU in the exception vector
	  before jumping to _startup in head.S and had an advantage that
	  it was possible to place a software breakpoint at 'reset' and
	  then enter your normal kernel breakpoints once the MMU was mapped
	  to the kernel mappings (0XC0000000).

	  This unfortunately won't work for U-Boot and likely also won't
	  work for using KEXEC to have a hot kernel ready for doing a
	  KDUMP.

	  So now the MMU is initialized in head.S but it's necessary to
	  use hardware breakpoints (gdb 'hbreak' cmd) to break at _startup.
	  xt-gdb can't place a Software Breakpoint in the  0XD region prior
	  to mapping the MMU and after mapping even if the area of low memory
	  was mapped gdb wouldn't remove the breakpoint on hitting it as the
	  PC wouldn't match. Since Hardware Breakpoints are recommended for
	  Linux configurations it seems reasonable to just assume they exist
	  and leave this older mechanism for unfortunate souls that choose
	  not to follow Tensilica's recommendation.

	  Selecting this will cause U-Boot to set the KERNEL Load and Entry

config XIP_KERNEL
	bool "Kernel Execute-In-Place from ROM"
	depends on PLATFORM_HAVE_XIP
	help
	  Execute-In-Place allows the kernel to run from non-volatile storage

	  space since the text section of the kernel is not loaded from flash
	  to RAM. Read-write sections, such as the data section and stack,
	  are still copied to RAM. The XIP kernel is not compressed since
	  it has to run directly from flash, so it will take more space to
	  store it. The flash address used to link the kernel object files,
	  and for storing it, is configuration dependent. Therefore, if you
	  say Y here, you must know the proper physical address where to
	  store the kernel image depending on your own flash memory usage.

	  Also note that the make target becomes "make xipImage" rather than
	  "make Image" or "make uImage". The final kernel binary to put in

	  Linux can use the full amount of RAM in the system by
	  default. However, the default MMUv2 setup only maps the
	  lowermost 128 MB of memory linearly to the areas starting
	  at 0xd0000000 (cached) and 0xd8000000 (uncached).
	  When there are more than 128 MB memory in the system not
	  all of it can be "permanently mapped" by the kernel.
	  The physical memory that's not permanently mapped is called
	  "high memory".

	  If you are compiling a kernel which will never run on a
	  machine with more than 128 MB total physical RAM, answer
	  N here.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config ARCH_FORCE_MAX_ORDER
	int "Maximum zone order"
	default "11"
	help
	  The kernel memory allocator divides physically contiguous memory
	  blocks into "zones", where each zone is a power of two number of
	  pages.  This option selects the largest power of two that the kernel
	  keeps in the memory allocator.  If you need to allocate very large
	  blocks of physically contiguous memory, then you may need to
	  increase this value.

	  This config option is actually maximum order plus one. For example,
	  a value of 11 means that the largest free memory block is 2^10 pages.
