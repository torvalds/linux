config EISA

	---help---
	  The Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus was
	  developed as an open alternative to the IBM MicroChannel bus.

	  The EISA bus provided some of the features of the IBM MicroChannel
	  bus while maintaining backward compatibility with cards made for
	  the older ISA bus.  The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and
	  1995 when it was made obsolete by the PCI bus.

	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for an EISA-based machine.

	  Otherwise, say N.

	  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David

	help
	  At some point in the future, this will cause floating-point math

	  should probably wait a while.

config M68KFPU_EMU_EXTRAPREC
	bool "Math emulation extra precision"
	depends on M68KFPU_EMU
	help
	  The fpu uses normally a few bit more during calculations for
	  correct rounding, the emulator can (often) do the same but this
	  extra calculation can cost quite some time, so you can disable
	  it here. The emulator will then "only" calculate with a 64 bit
	  mantissa and round slightly incorrect, what is more than enough
	  for normal usage.

config M68KFPU_EMU_ONLY
	bool "Math emulation only kernel"
	depends on M68KFPU_EMU
	help
	  This option prevents any floating-point instructions from being
	  compiled into the kernel, thereby the kernel doesn't save any
	  floating point context anymore during task switches, so this
	  kernel will only be usable on machines without a floating-point
	  math coprocessor. This makes the kernel a bit faster as no tests
	  needs to be executed whether a floating-point instruction in the
	  kernel should be executed or not.

config ADVANCED

	  This gives you access to some advanced options for the CPU. The
	  defaults should be fine for most users, but these options may make
	  it possible for you to improve performance somewhat if you know what
	  you are doing.

	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about these options.

	  Most users should say N to this question.

config RMW_INSNS
	bool "Use read-modify-write instructions"
	depends on ADVANCED
	---help---
	  This allows to use certain instructions that work with indivisible
	  read-modify-write bus cycles. While this is faster than the
	  workaround of disabling interrupts, it can conflict with DMA
	  ( = direct memory access) on many Amiga systems, and it is also said
	  to destabilize other machines. It is very likely that this will
	  cause serious problems on any Amiga or Atari Medusa if set. The only
	  configuration where it should work are 68030-based Ataris, where it
	  apparently improves performance. But you've been warned! Unless you
	  really know what you are doing, say N. Try Y only if you're quite

config 060_WRITETHROUGH
	bool "Use write-through caching for 68060 supervisor accesses"
	depends on ADVANCED && M68060
	---help---
	  The 68060 generally uses copyback caching of recently accessed data.
	  Copyback caching means that memory writes will be held in an on-chip
	  cache and only written back to memory some time later.  Saying Y
	  here will force supervisor (kernel) accesses to use writethrough
	  caching.  Writethrough caching means that data is written to memory
	  straight away, so that cache and memory data always agree.
	  Writethrough caching is less efficient, but is needed for some
	  drivers on 68060 based systems where the 68060 bus snooping signal
	  is hardwired on.  The 53c710 SCSI driver is known to suffer from
	  this problem.
