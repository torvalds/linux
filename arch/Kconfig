config OPROFILE
	tristate "OProfile system profiling"
	depends on PROFILING
	depends on HAVE_OPROFILE
	select RING_BUFFER
	select RING_BUFFER_ALLOW_SWAP
	help
	  OProfile is a profiling system capable of profiling the
	  whole system, include the kernel, kernel modules, libraries,
	  and applications.

	  If unsure, say N.

config OPROFILE_EVENT_MULTIPLEX
	bool "OProfile multiplexing support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	default n
	depends on OPROFILE && X86
	help
	  The number of hardware counters is limited. The multiplexing
	  feature enables OProfile to gather more events than counters
	  are provided by the hardware. This is realized by switching
	  between events at an user specified time interval.

	  If unsure, say N.

config HAVE_OPROFILE
	bool

config OPROFILE_NMI_TIMER
	def_bool y
	depends on PERF_EVENTS && HAVE_PERF_EVENTS_NMI

config KPROBES
	bool "Kprobes"
	depends on MODULES
	depends on HAVE_KPROBES
	select KALLSYMS
	help
	  Kprobes allows you to trap at almost any kernel address and
	  execute a callback function.  register_kprobe() establishes
	  a probepoint and specifies the callback.  Kprobes is useful
	  for kernel debugging, non-intrusive instrumentation and testing.
	  If in doubt, say "N".

config JUMP_LABEL
       bool "Optimize very unlikely/likely branches"
       depends on HAVE_ARCH_JUMP_LABEL
       help
         This option enables a transparent branch optimization that
	 makes certain almost-always-true or almost-always-false branch
	 conditions even cheaper to execute within the kernel.

	 Certain performance-sensitive kernel code, such as trace points,
	 scheduler functionality, networking code and KVM have such
	 branches and include support for this optimization technique.

         If it is detected that the compiler has support for "asm goto",
	 the kernel will compile such branches with just a nop
	 instruction. When the condition flag is toggled to true, the
	 nop will be converted to a jump instruction to execute the
	 conditional block of instructions.

	 This technique lowers overhead and stress on the branch prediction
	 of the processor and generally makes the kernel faster. The update
	 of the condition is slower, but those are always very rare.

	 ( On 32-bit x86, the necessary options added to the compiler
	   flags may increase the size of the kernel slightly. )

config OPTPROBES
	def_bool y
	depends on KPROBES && HAVE_OPTPROBES
	depends on !PREEMPT

config KPROBES_ON_FTRACE
	def_bool y
	depends on KPROBES && HAVE_KPROBES_ON_FTRACE
	depends on DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS
	help
	 If function tracer is enabled and the arch supports full
	 passing of pt_regs to function tracing, then kprobes can
	 optimize on top of function tracing.

config UPROBES
	bool "Transparent user-space probes (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on UPROBE_EVENT && PERF_EVENTS
	default n
	select PERCPU_RWSEM
	help
	  Uprobes is the user-space counterpart to kprobes: they
	  enable instrumentation applications (such as 'perf probe')
	  to establish unintrusive probes in user-space binaries and
	  libraries, by executing handler functions when the probes
	  are hit by user-space applications.

	  ( These probes come in the form of single-byte breakpoints,
	    managed by the kernel and kept transparent to the probed
	    application. )

	  If in doubt, say "N".

config HAVE_64BIT_ALIGNED_ACCESS
	def_bool 64BIT && !HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
	help
	  Some architectures require 64 bit accesses to be 64 bit
	  aligned, which also requires structs containing 64 bit values
	  to be 64 bit aligned too. This includes some 32 bit
	  architectures which can do 64 bit accesses, as well as 64 bit
	  architectures without unaligned access.

	  This symbol should be selected by an architecture if 64 bit
	  accesses are required to be 64 bit aligned in this way even
	  though it is not a 64 bit architecture.

	  See Documentation/unaligned-memory-access.txt for more
	  information on the topic of unaligned memory accesses.

config HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
	bool
	help
	  Some architectures are unable to perform unaligned accesses
	  without the use of get_unaligned/put_unaligned. Others are
	  unable to perform such accesses efficiently (e.g. trap on
	  unaligned access and require fixing it up in the exception
	  handler.)

	  This symbol should be selected by an architecture if it can
	  perform unaligned accesses efficiently to allow different
	  code paths to be selected for these cases. Some network
	  drivers, for example, could opt to not fix up alignment
	  problems with received packets if doing so would not help
	  much.

	  See Documentation/unaligned-memory-access.txt for more
	  information on the topic of unaligned memory accesses.

config ARCH_USE_BUILTIN_BSWAP
       bool
       help
	 Modern versions of GCC (since 4.4) have builtin functions
	 for handling byte-swapping. Using these, instead of the old
	 inline assembler that the architecture code provides in the
	 __arch_bswapXX() macros, allows the compiler to see what's
	 happening and offers more opportunity for optimisation. In
	 particular, the compiler will be able to combine the byteswap
	 with a nearby load or store and use load-and-swap or
	 store-and-swap instructions if the architecture has them. It
	 should almost *never* result in code which is worse than the
	 hand-coded assembler in <asm/swab.h>.  But just in case it
	 does, the use of the builtins is optional.

	 Any architecture with load-and-swap or store-and-swap
	 instructions should set this. And it shouldn't hurt to set it
	 on architectures that don't have such instructions.

config KRETPROBES

config USER_RETURN_NOTIFIER

	bool
	help
	  This symbol should be selected by an architecure if it supports
	  the API needed to access registers and stack entries from pt_regs,
	  declared in asm/ptrace.h
	  For example the kprobes-based event tracer needs this API.

config HAVE_CLK

	  Depending on the arch implementation of hardware breakpoints,

	  breakpoints addresses, others have mixed registers to store
	  them but define the access type in a control register.
	  Select this option if your arch implements breakpoints under the

config HAVE_PERF_EVENTS_NMI
	bool

	  System hardware can generate an NMI using the perf event
	  subsystem.  Also has support for calculating CPU cycle events
	  to determine how many clock cycles in a given period.

config HAVE_PERF_REGS

	  Support selective register dumps for perf events. This includes
	  bit-mapping of each registers and a unique architecture id.

config HAVE_PERF_USER_STACK_DUMP

	  - syscall_get_arguments()
	  - syscall_rollback()
	  - syscall_set_return_value()
	  - SIGSYS siginfo_t support
	  - secure_computing is called from a ptrace_event()-safe context
	  - secure_computing return value is checked and a return value of -1
	    results in the system call being skipped immediately.

config SECCOMP_FILTER

config HAVE_CONTEXT_TRACKING
	bool
	help
	  Provide kernel/user boundaries probes necessary for subsystems
	  that need it, such as userspace RCU extended quiescent state.
	  Syscalls need to be wrapped inside user_exit()-user_enter() through
	  the slow path using TIF_NOHZ flag. Exceptions handlers must be
	  wrapped as well. Irqs are already protected inside
	  rcu_irq_enter/rcu_irq_exit() but preemption or signal handling on
	  irq exit still need to be protected.

config HAVE_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING

config HAVE_IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING

config HAVE_ARCH_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE

config HAVE_MOD_ARCH_SPECIFIC
	bool
	help
	  The arch uses struct mod_arch_specific to store data.  Many arches

	  relocations will give an error.

config HAVE_UNDERSCORE_SYMBOL_PREFIX

	  Some architectures generate an _ in front of C symbols; things like
	  module loading and assembly files need to know about this.
