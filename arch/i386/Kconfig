config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  Note that if you say Y here and choose architecture "586" or
	  "Pentium" under "Processor family", the kernel will not work on 486
	  architectures. Similarly, multiprocessor kernels for the "PPro"
	  architecture may not work on all Pentium based boards.

	  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
	  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below. The "Advanced Power
	  Management" code will be disabled if you say Y here.

	  This option is needed for IBM systems that use the Summit/EXA chipset.
	  In particular, it is needed for the x440.

	  If you don't have one of these computers, you should say N here.
	  If you want to build a NUMA kernel, you must select ACPI.

	  The SGI Visual Workstation series is an IA32-based workstation
	  based on SGI systems chips with some legacy PC hardware attached.

	  Say Y here to create a kernel to run on the SGI 320 or 540.

	  Paravirtualization is a way of running multiple instances of
	  Linux on the same machine, under a hypervisor.  This option
	  changes the kernel so it can modify itself when it is run
	  under a hypervisor, improving performance significantly.

	  A local APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) is an
	  integrated interrupt controller in the CPU. If you have a single-CPU
	  system which has a processor with a local APIC, you can say Y here to
	  enable and use it. If you say Y here even though your machine doesn't
	  have a local APIC, then the kernel will still run with no slowdown at
	  all. The local APIC supports CPU-generated self-interrupts (timer,
	  performance counters), and the NMI watchdog which detects hard
	  lockups.

config X86_UP_IOAPIC
	bool "IO-APIC support on uniprocessors"
	depends on X86_UP_APIC
	help
	  An IO-APIC (I/O Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) is an

	  SMP systems and many recent uniprocessor systems have one.

	  If you have a single-CPU system with an IO-APIC, you can say Y here

config X86_MCE

	depends on !X86_VOYAGER
	---help---
	  Machine Check Exception support allows the processor to notify the
	  kernel if it detects a problem (e.g. overheating, component failure).
	  The action the kernel takes depends on the severity of the problem,
	  ranging from a warning message on the console, to halting the machine.
	  Your processor must be a Pentium or newer to support this - check the
	  flags in /proc/cpuinfo for mce.  Note that some older Pentium systems
	  have a design flaw which leads to false MCE events - hence MCE is
	  disabled on all P5 processors, unless explicitly enabled with "mce"
	  as a boot argument.  Similarly, if MCE is built in and creates a
	  problem on some new non-standard machine, you can boot with "nomce"
	  to disable it.  MCE support simply ignores non-MCE processors like
	  the 386 and 486, so nearly everyone can say Y here.

config X86_MCE_NONFATAL
	tristate "Check for non-fatal errors on AMD Athlon/Duron / Intel Pentium 4"
	depends on X86_MCE
	help
	  Enabling this feature starts a timer that triggers every 5 seconds which
	  will look at the machine check registers to see if anything happened.
	  Non-fatal problems automatically get corrected (but still logged).
	  Disable this if you don't want to see these messages.
	  Seeing the messages this option prints out may be indicative of dying hardware,
	  or out-of-spec (ie, overclocked) hardware.
	  This option only does something on certain CPUs.

	bool "Enable VM86 support" if EMBEDDED
	help
          This option is required by programs like DOSEMU to run 16-bit legacy
	  code on X86 processors. It also may be needed by software like
          XFree86 to initialize some video cards via BIOS. Disabling this
          option saves about 6k.

config TOSHIBA
	tristate "Toshiba Laptop support"
	---help---
	  This adds a driver to safely access the System Management Mode of
	  the CPU on Toshiba portables with a genuine Toshiba BIOS. It does
	  not work on models with a Phoenix BIOS. The System Management Mode
	  is used to set the BIOS and power saving options on Toshiba portables.

	  For information on utilities to make use of this driver see the
	  Toshiba Linux utilities web site at:

config I8K
	tristate "Dell laptop support"
	---help---
	  This adds a driver to safely access the System Management Mode
	  of the CPU on the Dell Inspiron 8000. The System Management Mode
	  is used to read cpu temperature and cooling fan status and to
	  control the fans on the I8K portables.

	  This driver has been tested only on the Inspiron 8000 but it may
	  also work with other Dell laptops. You can force loading on other
	  models by passing the parameter `force=1' to the module. Use at
	  your own risk.

	  For information on utilities to make use of this driver see the

	  This enables chipset and/or board specific fixups to be done
	  in order to get reboot to work correctly. This is only needed on
	  some combinations of hardware and BIOS. The symptom, for which
	  this config is intended, is when reboot ends with a stalled/hung

	---help---
	  Linux can use up to 64 Gigabytes of physical memory on x86 systems.
	  However, the address space of 32-bit x86 processors is only 4
	  Gigabytes large. That means that, if you have a large amount of
	  physical memory, not all of it can be "permanently mapped" by the
	  kernel. The physical memory that's not permanently mapped is called
	  "high memory".

	  If you are compiling a kernel which will never run on a machine with
	  more than 1 Gigabyte total physical RAM, answer "off" here (default
	  choice and suitable for most users). This will result in a "3GB/1GB"
	  split: 3GB are mapped so that each process sees a 3GB virtual memory
	  space and the remaining part of the 4GB virtual memory space is used
	  by the kernel to permanently map as much physical memory as
	  possible.

	  If the machine has between 1 and 4 Gigabytes physical RAM, then
	  answer "4GB" here.

	  If more than 4 Gigabytes is used then answer "64GB" here. This
	  selection turns Intel PAE (Physical Address Extension) mode on.
	  PAE implements 3-level paging on IA32 processors. PAE is fully
	  supported by Linux, PAE mode is implemented on all recent Intel
	  processors (Pentium Pro and better). NOTE: If you say "64GB" here,
	  then the kernel will not boot on CPUs that don't support PAE!

	  The actual amount of total physical memory will either be
	  auto detected or can be forced by using a kernel command line option
	  such as "mem=256M". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the

config MATH_EMULATION
	bool "Math emulation"
	---help---
	  Linux can emulate a math coprocessor (used for floating point

	  a math coprocessor built in, 486SX and 386 do not, unless you added
	  a 487DX or 387, respectively. (The messages during boot time can
	  give you some hints here ["man dmesg"].) Everyone needs either a
	  coprocessor or this emulation.

	  If you don't have a math coprocessor, you need to say Y here; if you
	  say Y here even though you have a coprocessor, the coprocessor will
	  be used nevertheless. (This behavior can be changed with the kernel
	  command line option "no387", which comes handy if your coprocessor
	  is broken. Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot
	  loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at
	  boot time.) This means that it is a good idea to say Y here if you
	  intend to use this kernel on different machines.

	  More information about the internals of the Linux math coprocessor
	  emulation can be found in <file:arch/i386/math-emu/README>.

	  If you are not sure, say Y; apart from resulting in a 66 KB bigger
	  kernel, it won't hurt.

config MTRR
	bool "MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support"
	---help---
	  On Intel P6 family processors (Pentium Pro, Pentium II and later)
	  the Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) may be used to control
	  processor access to memory ranges. This is most useful if you have
	  a video (VGA) card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining
	  allows bus write transfers to be combined into a larger transfer
	  before bursting over the PCI/AGP bus. This can increase performance
	  of image write operations 2.5 times or more. Saying Y here creates a
	  /proc/mtrr file which may be used to manipulate your processor's
	  MTRRs. Typically the X server should use this.

	  This code has a reasonably generic interface so that similar
	  control registers on other processors can be easily supported
	  as well:

	  The Cyrix 6x86, 6x86MX and M II processors have Address Range
	  Registers (ARRs) which provide a similar functionality to MTRRs. For
	  these, the ARRs are used to emulate the MTRRs.
	  The AMD K6-2 (stepping 8 and above) and K6-3 processors have two
	  MTRRs. The Centaur C6 (WinChip) has 8 MCRs, allowing
	  write-combining. All of these processors are supported by this code
	  and it makes sense to say Y here if you have one of them.

	  Saying Y here also fixes a problem with buggy SMP BIOSes which only
	  set the MTRRs for the boot CPU and not for the secondary CPUs. This
	  can lead to all sorts of problems, so it's good to say Y here.

	  You can safely say Y even if your machine doesn't have MTRRs, you'll
	  just add about 9 KB to your kernel.

	  See <file:Documentation/mtrr.txt> for more information.

	  This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications

	  enabled via /proc/<pid>/seccomp, it cannot be disabled
	  and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls
	  defined by each seccomp mode.

	  If unsure, say Y. Only embedded should say N here.

config KEXEC
	bool "kexec system call"
	help
	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
	  but it is independent of the system firmware.   And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you.  It may help to enable device hotplugging
	  support.  As of this writing the exact hardware interface is
	  strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be made.

	  Generate crash dump after being started by kexec.
          This should be normally only set in special crash dump kernels
	  which are loaded in the main kernel with kexec-tools into
	  a specially reserved region and then later executed after
	  a crash by kdump/kexec. The crash dump kernel must be compiled
          to a memory address not used by the main kernel or BIOS using

	  The relocations tend to the kernel binary about 10% larger,
          but are discarded at runtime.

	  One use is for the kexec on panic case where the recovery kernel
          must live at a different physical address than the primary
          kernel.

config PHYSICAL_ALIGN
	hex "Alignment value to which kernel should be aligned"
	default "0x100000"

	help
	  This value puts the alignment restrictions on physical address
 	  where kernel is loaded and run from. Kernel is compiled for an
 	  address which meets above alignment restriction.

 	  If bootloader loads the kernel at a non-aligned address and
 	  CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is set, kernel will move itself to nearest
 	  address aligned to above value and run from there.

 	  If bootloader loads the kernel at a non-aligned address and
 	  CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is not set, kernel will ignore the run time
 	  load address and decompress itself to the address it has been
 	  compiled for and run from there. The address for which kernel is
 	  compiled already meets above alignment restrictions. Hence the
 	  end result is that kernel runs from a physical address meeting
	  above alignment restrictions.

	  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.

	---help---
	  APM is a BIOS specification for saving power using several different
	  techniques. This is mostly useful for battery powered laptops with
	  APM compliant BIOSes. If you say Y here, the system time will be
	  reset after a RESUME operation, the /proc/apm device will provide
	  battery status information, and user-space programs will receive
	  notification of APM "events" (e.g. battery status change).

	  If you select "Y" here, you can disable actual use of the APM
	  BIOS by passing the "apm=off" option to the kernel at boot time.

	  Note that the APM support is almost completely disabled for
	  machines with more than one CPU.

	  In order to use APM, you will need supporting software. For location
	  and more information, read <file:Documentation/pm.txt> and the
	  Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver does not spin down disk drives (see the hdparm(8)
	  manpage ("man 8 hdparm") for that), and it doesn't turn off
	  VESA-compliant "green" monitors.

	  This driver does not support the TI 4000M TravelMate and the ACER
	  486/DX4/75 because they don't have compliant BIOSes. Many "green"
	  desktop machines also don't have compliant BIOSes, and this driver
	  may cause those machines to panic during the boot phase.

	  Generally, if you don't have a battery in your machine, there isn't
	  much point in using this driver and you should say N. If you get
	  random kernel OOPSes or reboots that don't seem to be related to
	  anything, try disabling/enabling this option (or disabling/enabling
	  APM in your BIOS).

	  Some other things you should try when experiencing seemingly random,
	  "weird" problems:

	  1) make sure that you have enough swap space and that it is
	  enabled.
	  2) pass the "no-hlt" option to the kernel
	  3) switch on floating point emulation in the kernel and pass
	  the "no387" option to the kernel
	  4) pass the "floppy=nodma" option to the kernel
	  5) pass the "mem=4M" option to the kernel (thereby disabling
	  all but the first 4 MB of RAM)
	  6) make sure that the CPU is not over clocked.
	  7) read the sig11 FAQ at <http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/>
	  8) disable the cache from your BIOS settings
	  9) install a fan for the video card or exchange video RAM
	  10) install a better fan for the CPU
	  11) exchange RAM chips
	  12) exchange the motherboard.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called apm.

config APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND
	bool "Ignore USER SUSPEND"
	depends on APM
	help
	  This option will ignore USER SUSPEND requests. On machines with a
	  compliant APM BIOS, you want to say N. However, on the NEC Versa M
	  series notebooks, it is necessary to say Y because of a BIOS bug.

config APM_DO_ENABLE
	bool "Enable PM at boot time"
	depends on APM
	---help---
	  Enable APM features at boot time. From page 36 of the APM BIOS
	  specification: "When disabled, the APM BIOS does not automatically
	  power manage devices, enter the Standby State, enter the Suspend
	  State, or take power saving steps in response to CPU Idle calls."
	  This driver will make CPU Idle calls when Linux is idle (unless this
	  feature is turned off -- see "Do CPU IDLE calls", below). This
	  should always save battery power, but more complicated APM features
	  will be dependent on your BIOS implementation. You may need to turn
	  this option off if your computer hangs at boot time when using APM
	  support, or if it beeps continuously instead of suspending. Turn
	  this off if you have a NEC UltraLite Versa 33/C or a Toshiba
	  T400CDT. This is off by default since most machines do fine without
	  this feature.

config APM_CPU_IDLE
	bool "Make CPU Idle calls when idle"
	depends on APM
	help
	  Enable calls to APM CPU Idle/CPU Busy inside the kernel's idle loop.
	  On some machines, this can activate improved power savings, such as
	  a slowed CPU clock rate, when the machine is idle. These idle calls
	  are made after the idle loop has run for some length of time (e.g.,
	  333 mS). On some machines, this will cause a hang at boot time or
	  whenever the CPU becomes idle. (On machines with more than one CPU,
	  this option does nothing.)

config APM_DISPLAY_BLANK
	bool "Enable console blanking using APM"
	depends on APM
	help
	  Enable console blanking using the APM. Some laptops can use this to
	  turn off the LCD backlight when the screen blanker of the Linux
	  virtual console blanks the screen. Note that this is only used by
	  the virtual console screen blanker, and won't turn off the backlight
	  when using the X Window system. This also doesn't have anything to
	  do with your VESA-compliant power-saving monitor. Further, this
	  option doesn't work for all laptops -- it might not turn off your
	  backlight at all, or it might print a lot of errors to the console,
	  especially if you are using gpm.

config APM_RTC_IS_GMT
	bool "RTC stores time in GMT"

	  Say Y here if your RTC (Real Time Clock a.k.a. hardware clock)
	  stores the time in GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). Say N if your RTC
	  stores localtime.

	  It is in fact recommended to store GMT in your RTC, because then you
	  don't have to worry about daylight savings time changes. The only
	  reason not to use GMT in your RTC is if you also run a broken OS
	  that doesn't understand GMT.

config APM_ALLOW_INTS
	bool "Allow interrupts during APM BIOS calls"
	depends on APM
	help
	  Normally we disable external interrupts while we are making calls to
	  the APM BIOS as a measure to lessen the effects of a badly behaving
	  BIOS implementation.  The BIOS should reenable interrupts if it
	  needs to.  Unfortunately, some BIOSes do not -- especially those in
	  many of the newer IBM Thinkpads.  If you experience hangs when you
	  suspend, try setting this to Y.  Otherwise, say N.

config APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF
	bool "Use real mode APM BIOS call to power off"
	depends on APM
