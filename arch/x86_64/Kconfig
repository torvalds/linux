	---help---
	  If you say Y here the 'File systems' section, you will be
	  able to update the microcode on Intel processors. You will
	  obviously need the actual microcode binary data itself which is
	  not shipped with the Linux kernel.

	  For latest news and information on obtaining all the required
	  ingredients for this driver, check:
	  <http://www.urbanmyth.org/microcode/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called microcode.
	  If you use modprobe or kmod you may also want to add the line
	  'alias char-major-10-184 microcode' to your /etc/modules.conf file.

config MTRR
	bool "MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support"
	---help---
	  On Intel P6 family processors (Pentium Pro, Pentium II and later)
	  the Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) may be used to control
	  processor access to memory ranges. This is most useful if you have
	  a video (VGA) card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining
	  allows bus write transfers to be combined into a larger transfer
	  before bursting over the PCI/AGP bus. This can increase performance
	  of image write operations 2.5 times or more. Saying Y here creates a
	  /proc/mtrr file which may be used to manipulate your processor's
	  MTRRs. Typically the X server should use this.

	  This code has a reasonably generic interface so that similar
	  control registers on other processors can be easily supported
	  as well.

	  Saying Y here also fixes a problem with buggy SMP BIOSes which only
	  set the MTRRs for the boot CPU and not for the secondary CPUs. This
	  can lead to all sorts of problems, so it's good to say Y here.

	  Just say Y here, all x86-64 machines support MTRRs.

	  See <file:Documentation/mtrr.txt> for more information.

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

config SCHED_SMT
	bool "SMT (Hyperthreading) scheduler support"
	depends on SMP
	default n
	help
	  SMT scheduler support improves the CPU scheduler's decision making
	  when dealing with Intel Pentium 4 chips with HyperThreading at a
	  cost of slightly increased overhead in some places. If unsure say
	  N here.

config K8_NUMA
       bool "K8 NUMA support"
       select NUMA
       depends on SMP
       help
	  Enable NUMA (Non Unified Memory Architecture) support for
	  AMD Opteron Multiprocessor systems. The kernel will try to allocate
	  memory used by a CPU on the local memory controller of the CPU
	  and add some more NUMA awareness to the kernel.
	  This code is recommended on all multiprocessor Opteron systems
	  and normally doesn't hurt on others.

config NUMA_EMU
	bool "NUMA emulation support"
	select NUMA
	depends on SMP
	help
	  Enable NUMA emulation. A flat machine will be split
	  into virtual nodes when booted with "numa=fake=N", where N is the
	  number of nodes. This is only useful for debugging.

config NR_CPUS
	int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-256)"
	range 2 256
	depends on SMP
	default "8"
	help
	  This allows you to specify the maximum number of CPUs which this
	  kernel will support. Current maximum is 256 CPUs due to
	  APIC addressing limits. Less depending on the hardware.

	  This is purely to save memory - each supported CPU requires
	  memory in the static kernel configuration.

config HOTPLUG_CPU
	bool "Support for hot-pluggable CPUs (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on SMP && HOTPLUG && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
		Say Y here to experiment with turning CPUs off and on.  CPUs
		can be controlled through /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#.
		Say N if you want to disable CPU hotplug.


config HPET_TIMER
	bool
	default y
	help
	  Use the IA-PC HPET (High Precision Event Timer) to manage
	  time in preference to the PIT and RTC, if a HPET is
	  present.  The HPET provides a stable time base on SMP
	  systems, unlike the TSC, but it is more expensive to access,
	  as it is off-chip.  You can find the HPET spec at
	  <http://www.intel.com/hardwaredesign/hpetspec.htm>.

config X86_PM_TIMER
	bool "PM timer"
	depends on ACPI
	default y
	help
	  Support the ACPI PM timer for time keeping. This is slow,
	  but is useful on some chipsets without HPET on systems with more
	  than one CPU. On a single processor or single socket multi core
	  system it is normally not required.
	  When the PM timer is active 64bit vsyscalls are disabled
	  and should not be enabled (/proc/sys/kernel/vsyscall64 should
	  not be changed).
	  The kernel selects the PM timer only as a last resort, so it is
	  useful to enable just in case.

config HPET_EMULATE_RTC
	bool "Provide RTC interrupt"
	depends on HPET_TIMER && RTC=y

config GART_IOMMU
	bool "IOMMU support"
	default y
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Support the IOMMU. Needed to run systems with more than 3GB of memory
	  properly with 32-bit PCI devices that do not support DAC (Double Address
	  Cycle). The IOMMU can be turned off at runtime with the iommu=off parameter.
	  Normally the kernel will take the right choice by itself.
	  This option includes a driver for the AMD Opteron/Athlon64 IOMMU
	  and a software emulation used on some other systems.
	  If unsure, say Y.

# need this always enabled with GART_IOMMU for the VIA workaround
config SWIOTLB
       bool
       depends on GART_IOMMU
       default y

config DUMMY_IOMMU
	bool
	depends on !GART_IOMMU && !SWIOTLB
	default y
	help
	  Don't use IOMMU code. This will cause problems when you have more than 4GB
	  of memory and any 32-bit devices. Don't turn on unless you know what you
	  are doing.

config X86_MCE
	bool "Machine check support" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	help
	   Include a machine check error handler to report hardware errors.
	   This version will require the mcelog utility to decode some
	   machine check error logs. See
	   ftp://ftp.x86-64.org/pub/linux/tools/mcelog

config X86_MCE_INTEL
	bool "Intel MCE features"
	depends on X86_MCE && X86_LOCAL_APIC
	default y
	help
	   Additional support for intel specific MCE features such as
	   the thermal monitor.

config PHYSICAL_START
	hex "Physical address where the kernel is loaded" if EMBEDDED
	default "0x100000"
	help
	  This gives the physical address where the kernel is loaded.
	  Primarily used in the case of kexec on panic where the
	  fail safe kernel needs to run at a different address than
	  the panic-ed kernel.

	  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.

config KEXEC
	bool "kexec system call (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
	  but it is indepedent of the system firmware.   And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similiarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you.  It may help to enable device hotplugging
	  support.  As of this writing the exact hardware interface is
	  strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be made.

config SECCOMP
	bool "Enable seccomp to safely compute untrusted bytecode"
	depends on PROC_FS
	default y
	help
	  This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications
	  that may need to compute untrusted bytecode during their
	  execution. By using pipes or other transports made available to
	  the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write
	  syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in
	  their own address space using seccomp. Once seccomp is
	  enabled via /proc/<pid>/seccomp, it cannot be disabled
	  and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls
	  defined by each seccomp mode.

	  If unsure, say Y. Only embedded should say N here.
