	---help---
	  On Intel P6 family processors (Pentium Pro, Pentium II and later)
	  the Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) may be used to control
	  processor access to memory ranges. This is most useful if you have
	  a video (VGA) card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining
	  allows bus write transfers to be combined into a larger transfer
	  before bursting over the PCI/AGP bus. This can increase performance
	  of image write operations 2.5 times or more. Saying Y here creates a
	  /proc/mtrr file which may be used to manipulate your processor's
	  MTRRs. Typically the X server should use this.

	  This code has a reasonably generic interface so that similar
	  control registers on other processors can be easily supported
	  as well.

	  Saying Y here also fixes a problem with buggy SMP BIOSes which only
	  set the MTRRs for the boot CPU and not for the secondary CPUs. This
	  can lead to all sorts of problems, so it's good to say Y here.

	  Just say Y here, all x86-64 machines support MTRRs.

	  See <file:Documentation/mtrr.txt> for more information.

config SMP

	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  properly with 32-bit PCI devices that do not support DAC
	  (Double Address Cycle). Calgary also supports bus level
	  isolation, where all DMAs pass through the IOMMU.  This
	  prevents them from going anywhere except their intended
	  destination. This catches hard-to-find kernel bugs and
	  mis-behaving drivers and devices that do not use the DMA-API
	  properly to set up their DMA buffers.  The IOMMU can be
	  turned off at boot time with the iommu=off parameter.

	help
	   Additional support for AMD specific MCE features such as
	   the DRAM Error Threshold.

config KEXEC
	bool "kexec system call"
	help
	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
	  but it is independent of the system firmware.   And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you.  It may help to enable device hotplugging
	  support.  As of this writing the exact hardware interface is
	  strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be made.

config CRASH_DUMP
	bool "kernel crash dumps (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Generate crash dump after being started by kexec.
	  This should be normally only set in special crash dump kernels
	  which are loaded in the main kernel with kexec-tools into
	  a specially reserved region and then later executed after
	  a crash by kdump/kexec. The crash dump kernel must be compiled
	  to a memory address not used by the main kernel or BIOS using
	  PHYSICAL_START, or it must be built as a relocatable image
	  (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y).
	  For more details see Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt

config RELOCATABLE
	bool "Build a relocatable kernel (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Builds a relocatable kernel. This enables loading and running
	  a kernel binary from a different physical address than it has
	  been compiled for.

	  One use is for the kexec on panic case where the recovery kernel
	  must live at a different physical address than the primary
	  kernel.

	  Note: If CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y, then the kernel runs from the address
	  it has been loaded at and the compile time physical address
	  (CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START) is ignored.

config PHYSICAL_START
	hex "Physical address where the kernel is loaded" if (EMBEDDED || CRASH_DUMP)
	default "0x200000"
	help
	  This gives the physical address where the kernel is loaded. It
	  should be aligned to 2MB boundary.

	  If kernel is a not relocatable (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n) then
	  bzImage will decompress itself to above physical address and
	  run from there. Otherwise, bzImage will run from the address where
	  it has been loaded by the boot loader and will ignore above physical
	  address.

	  In normal kdump cases one does not have to set/change this option
	  as now bzImage can be compiled as a completely relocatable image
	  (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y) and be used to load and run from a different
	  address. This option is mainly useful for the folks who don't want
	  to use a bzImage for capturing the crash dump and want to use a
	  vmlinux instead.

	  So if you are using bzImage for capturing the crash dump, leave
	  the value here unchanged to 0x200000 and set CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y.
	  Otherwise if you plan to use vmlinux for capturing the crash dump
	  change this value to start of the reserved region (Typically 16MB
	  0x1000000). In other words, it can be set based on the "X" value as
	  specified in the "crashkernel=YM@XM" command line boot parameter
	  passed to the panic-ed kernel. Typically this parameter is set as
	  crashkernel=64M@16M. Please take a look at
	  Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt for more details about crash dumps.

	  Usage of bzImage for capturing the crash dump is advantageous as
	  one does not have to build two kernels. Same kernel can be used
	  as production kernel and capture kernel.

	  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.

config SECCOMP
	bool "Enable seccomp to safely compute untrusted bytecode"
	depends on PROC_FS
	default y
	help
	  This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications
	  that may need to compute untrusted bytecode during their
	  execution. By using pipes or other transports made available to
	  the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write
	  syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in
	  their own address space using seccomp. Once seccomp is
	  enabled via /proc/<pid>/seccomp, it cannot be disabled
	  and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls
	  defined by each seccomp mode.

	  If unsure, say Y. Only embedded should say N here.

config CC_STACKPROTECTOR
	bool "Enable -fstack-protector buffer overflow detection (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
         This option turns on the -fstack-protector GCC feature. This
	  feature puts, at the beginning of critical functions, a canary
	  value on the stack just before the return address, and validates
	  the value just before actually returning.  Stack based buffer
	  overflows (that need to overwrite this return address) now also
	  overwrite the canary, which gets detected and the attack is then
	  neutralized via a kernel panic.

	  This feature requires gcc version 4.2 or above, or a distribution
	  gcc with the feature backported. Older versions are automatically
	  detected and for those versions, this configuration option is ignored.

config CC_STACKPROTECTOR_ALL
	bool "Use stack-protector for all functions"
	depends on CC_STACKPROTECTOR
	help
	  Normally, GCC only inserts the canary value protection for
	  functions that use large-ish on-stack buffers. By enabling
	  this option, GCC will be asked to do this for ALL functions.
