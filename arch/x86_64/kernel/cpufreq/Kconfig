config X86_POWERNOW_K8
	tristate "AMD Opteron/Athlon64 PowerNow!"
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for mobile AMD Opteron/Athlon64 processors.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>. 

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_POWERNOW_K8_ACPI

	depends on X86_POWERNOW_K8 && ACPI_PROCESSOR
	depends on !(X86_POWERNOW_K8 = y && ACPI_PROCESSOR = m)
	default y

config X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO
	tristate "Intel Enhanced SpeedStep (deprecated)"
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	depends on ACPI_PROCESSOR
	help
	  This is deprecated and this functionality is now merged into
	  acpi_cpufreq (X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ). Use that driver instead of
	  speedstep_centrino.
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for Enhanced SpeedStep enabled
	  mobile CPUs.  This means Intel Pentium M (Centrino) CPUs
	  or 64bit enabled Intel Xeons.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_ACPI
	bool
	depends on X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO

config X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ
	tristate "ACPI Processor P-States driver"
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	depends on ACPI_PROCESSOR
	help
	  This driver adds a CPUFreq driver which utilizes the ACPI
	  Processor Performance States.
	  This driver also supports Intel Enhanced Speedstep.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

comment "shared options"

config X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ_PROC_INTF
        bool "/proc/acpi/processor/../performance interface (deprecated)"
	depends on PROC_FS
	depends on X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ || X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_ACPI || X86_POWERNOW_K8_ACPI
	help
	  This enables the deprecated /proc/acpi/processor/../performance
	  interface. While it is helpful for debugging, the generic,
	  cross-architecture cpufreq interfaces should be used.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_P4_CLOCKMOD
	tristate "Intel Pentium 4 clock modulation"
	depends on EMBEDDED
	help
	  This adds the clock modulation driver for Intel Pentium 4 / XEON
	  processors.  When enabled it will lower CPU temperature by skipping
	  clocks.

	  This driver should be only used in exceptional
	  circumstances when very low power is needed because it causes severe
	  slowdowns and noticeable latencies.  Normally Speedstep should be used
	  instead.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  Unless you are absolutely sure say N.


config X86_SPEEDSTEP_LIB
