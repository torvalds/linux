	  There are four types of PowerPC chips supported.  The more common
	  types (601, 603, 604, 740, 750, 7400), the older Freescale
	  (formerly Motorola) embedded versions (821, 823, 850, 855, 860,
	  52xx, 82xx, 83xx), the IBM embedded versions (403 and 405) and
	  the Book E embedded processors from IBM (44x) and Freescale (85xx).
	  For support for 64-bit processors, set ARCH=powerpc.
	  Unless you are building a kernel for one of the embedded processor
	  systems, choose 6xx.
	  Also note that because the 52xx, 82xx, & 83xx family have a 603e

config ALTIVEC

	depends on 6xx
	depends on !8260 && !83xx
	---help---
	  This option enables kernel support for the Altivec extensions to the
	  PowerPC processor. The kernel currently supports saving and restoring
	  altivec registers, and turning on the 'altivec enable' bit so user
	  processes can execute altivec instructions.

	  This option is only usefully if you have a processor that supports
	  altivec (G4, otherwise known as 74xx series), but does not have
	  any affect on a non-altivec cpu (it does, however add code to the
	  kernel).

	  If in doubt, say Y here.

config SPE
	bool "SPE Support"
	depends on E200 || E500
	---help---
	  This option enables kernel support for the Signal Processing
	  Extensions (SPE) to the PowerPC processor. The kernel currently
	  supports saving and restoring SPE registers, and turning on the
	  'spe enable' bit so user processes can execute SPE instructions.

	  This option is only useful if you have a processor that supports
	  SPE (e500, otherwise known as 85xx series), but does not have any
	  effect on a non-spe cpu (it does, however add code to the kernel).

	  If in doubt, say Y here.

config TAU
	bool "Thermal Management Support"
	depends on 6xx && !8260 && !83xx
	help
	  G3 and G4 processors have an on-chip temperature sensor called the
	  'Thermal Assist Unit (TAU)', which, in theory, can measure the on-die
	  temperature within 2-4 degrees Celsius. This option shows the current
	  on-die temperature in /proc/cpuinfo if the cpu supports it.

	  Unfortunately, on some chip revisions, this sensor is very inaccurate
	  and in some cases, does not work at all, so don't assume the cpu
	  temp is actually what /proc/cpuinfo says it is.

config TAU_INT
	bool "Interrupt driven TAU driver (DANGEROUS)"
	depends on TAU
	---help---
	  The TAU supports an interrupt driven mode which causes an interrupt
	  whenever the temperature goes out of range. This is the fastest way
	  to get notified the temp has exceeded a range. With this option off,
	  a timer is used to re-check the temperature periodically.

	  However, on some cpus it appears that the TAU interrupt hardware
	  is buggy and can cause a situation which would lead unexplained hard
	  lockups.

	  Unless you are extending the TAU driver, or enjoy kernel/hardware
	  debugging, leave this option off.

config TAU_AVERAGE
	bool "Average high and low temp"
	depends on TAU
	---help---
	  The TAU hardware can compare the temperature to an upper and lower
	  bound.  The default behavior is to show both the upper and lower
	  bound in /proc/cpuinfo. If the range is large, the temperature is
	  either changing a lot, or the TAU hardware is broken (likely on some
	  G4's). If the range is small (around 4 degrees), the temperature is
	  relatively stable.  If you say Y here, a single temperature value,
	  halfway between the upper and lower bounds, will be reported in
	  /proc/cpuinfo.

	  If in doubt, say N here.

config MATH_EMULATION
	bool "Math emulation"
	depends on 4xx || 8xx || E200 || E500
	---help---
	  Some PowerPC chips designed for embedded applications do not have
	  a floating-point unit and therefore do not implement the
	  floating-point instructions in the PowerPC instruction set.  If you
	  say Y here, the kernel will include code to emulate a floating-point
	  unit, which will allow programs that use floating-point
	  instructions to run.

	  If you have an Apple machine or an IBM RS/6000 or pSeries machine,
	  or any machine with a 6xx, 7xx or 7xxx series processor, say N
	  here.  Saying Y here will not hurt performance (on any machine) but
	  will increase the size of the kernel.

config KEXEC
	bool "kexec system call (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
	  but it is independent of the system firmware.   And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you.  It may help to enable device hotplugging
	  support.  As of this writing the exact hardware interface is
	  strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be made.

	  In the GameCube implementation, kexec allows you to load and
	  run DOL files, including kernel and homebrew DOLs.

config PPC601_SYNC_FIX
	bool "Workarounds for PPC601 bugs"
	depends on 6xx && PPC_PREP
	help
	  Some versions of the PPC601 (the first PowerPC chip) have bugs which
	  mean that extra synchronization instructions are required near
	  certain instructions, typically those that make major changes to the
	  CPU state.  These extra instructions reduce performance slightly.
	  If you say N here, these extra instructions will not be included,
	  resulting in a kernel which will run faster but may not run at all
	  on some systems with the PPC601 chip.

	  If in doubt, say Y here.
