# Some versions of binutils, not currently mainline as of 2019/02/04, support
# an -mfix-loongson3-llsc flag which emits a sync prior to each ll instruction
# to work around a CPU bug (see __SYNC_loongson3_war in asm/sync.h for a
# description).
#
# We disable this in order to prevent the assembler meddling with the
# instruction that labels refer to, ie. if we label an ll instruction:
#
# 1: ll v0, 0(a0)
#
# ...then with the assembler fix applied the label may actually point at a sync
# instruction inserted by the assembler, and if we were using the label in an
# exception table the table would no longer contain the address of the ll
# instruction.
#
# Avoid this by explicitly disabling that assembler behaviour. If upstream
# binutils does not merge support for the flag then we can revisit & remove
# this later - for now it ensures vendor toolchains don't cause problems.

# binutils from v2.25 on and gcc starting from v4.9.0 treat -march=loongson3a

# that GCC might generate R2 code for -march=loongson3a which then is rejected
# by GAS.  The cc-option can't probe for this behaviour so -march=loongson3a
# can't easily be used safely within the kbuild framework.
