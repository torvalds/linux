	  The CN63XXP1 chip requires build time workarounds to
	  function reliably, select this option to enable them.  These
	  workarounds will cause a slight decrease in performance on
	  non-CN63XXP1 hardware, so it is recommended to select "n"

	help
	  CVMSEG LM is a segment that accesses portions of the dcache as a
	  local memory; the larger CVMSEG is, the smaller the cache is.
	  This selects the size of CVMSEG LM, which is in cache blocks. The
	  legally range is from zero to 54 cache blocks (i.e. CVMSEG LM is
	  between zero and 6192 bytes).
