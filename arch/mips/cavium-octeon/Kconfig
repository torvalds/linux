	  The CN63XXP1 chip requires build time workarounds to

	  workarounds will cause a slight decrease in performance on

	  CVMSEG LM is a segment that accesses portions of the dcache as a
	  local memory; the larger CVMSEG is, the smaller the cache is.
	  This selects the size of CVMSEG LM, which is in cache blocks. The

	  between zero and 6192 bytes).
