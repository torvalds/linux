	---help---
	  Say Y here to get to see options for using your Linux host to run other
	  operating systems inside virtual machines (guests).
	  This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled.

	---help---
	  Support hosting paravirtualized guest machines using the SIE
	  virtualization capability on the mainframe. This should work
	  on any 64bit machine.

	  This module provides access to the hardware capabilities through
	  a character device node named /dev/kvm.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called kvm.

	  If unsure, say N.

config KVM_AWARE_CMF
	depends on KVM
	bool "KVM aware sampling"
	---help---
	  This option enhances the sampling data from the CPU Measurement
	  Facility with additional information, that allows to distinguish
	  guest(s) and host when using the kernel based virtual machine
	  functionality.

	  If unsure, say N.

# OK, it's a little counter-intuitive to do this, but it puts it neatly under
# the virtualization menu.
