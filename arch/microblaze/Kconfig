	  This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications

	  execution. By using pipes or other transports made available to
	  the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write
	  syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in
	  their own address space using seccomp. Once seccomp is
	  enabled via /proc/<pid>/seccomp, it cannot be disabled
	  and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls
	  defined by each seccomp mode.

	  If unsure, say Y. Only embedded should say N here.
