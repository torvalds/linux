	  This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications

	  syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in

	  enabled via /proc/<pid>/seccomp, it cannot be disabled
	  and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls
	  defined by each seccomp mode.

	  The address space of Microblaze processors is only 4 Gigabytes large
	  and it has to accommodate user address space, kernel address
	  space as well as some memory mapped IO. That means that, if you
	  have a large amount of physical memory and/or IO, not all of the

	  For example, each cached file will using a multiple of the
