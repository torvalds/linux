	  This option will enable prompting for a variety of advanced kernel

	  work if they are set incorrectly, but can be used to optimize certain
	  aspects of kernel memory management.

	help
	  The address space of Microblaze processors is only 4 Gigabytes large
	  and it has to accommodate user address space, kernel address
	  space as well as some memory mapped IO. That means that, if you
	  have a large amount of physical memory and/or IO, not all of the
	  memory can be "permanently mapped" by the kernel. The physical
	  memory that is not permanently mapped is called "high memory".

	  If unsure, say n.

config LOWMEM_SIZE_BOOL
	bool "Set maximum low memory"
	depends on ADVANCED_OPTIONS
	help
	  This option allows you to set the maximum amount of memory which
	  will be used as "low memory", that is, memory which the kernel can
	  access directly, without having to set up a kernel virtual mapping.
	  This can be useful in optimizing the layout of kernel virtual
	  memory.

	  Set this option to have the kernel override the CPU Reset vector.
	  If zero, no change will be made to the MicroBlaze reset vector at
	  address 0x0.
	  If non-zero, a jump instruction to this address, will be written
	  to the reset vector at address 0x0.
	  If you are unsure, set it to default value 0x0.

config KERNEL_START_BOOL

	depends on ADVANCED_OPTIONS
	help
	  This option allows you to set the kernel virtual address at which
	  the kernel will map low memory (the kernel image will be linked at
	  this address).  This can be useful in optimizing the virtual memory
	  layout of the system.
