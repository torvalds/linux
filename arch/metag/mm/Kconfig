	  Map the kernel with large pages to reduce TLB pressure.

config PAGE_SIZE_4K

	help
	  This is the default page size used by all Meta cores.

config PAGE_SIZE_8K
	bool "8kB"

	  This enables 8kB pages as supported by Meta 2.x and later MMUs.

config NUMA
	bool "Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) Support"
	select ARCH_WANT_NUMA_VARIABLE_LOCALITY
	help
	  Some Meta systems have MMU-mappable on-chip memories with
	  lower latencies than main memory. This enables support for
	  these blocks by binding them to nodes and allowing
	  memory policies to be used for prioritizing and controlling
	  allocation behaviour.

config FORCE_MAX_ZONEORDER
	int "Maximum zone order"
	range 10 32
	default "10"
	help
	  The kernel memory allocator divides physically contiguous memory
	  blocks into "zones", where each zone is a power of two number of
	  pages.  This option selects the largest power of two that the kernel
	  keeps in the memory allocator.  If you need to allocate very large
	  blocks of physically contiguous memory, then you may need to
	  increase this value.

	  This config option is actually maximum order plus one. For example,
	  a value of 11 means that the largest free memory block is 2^10 pages.

	  The page size is not necessarily 4KB.  Keep this in mind
	  when choosing a value for this option.

config METAG_L2C
	bool "Level 2 Cache Support"
	depends on METAG_META21
	help
	  Press y here to enable support for the Meta Level 2 (L2) cache. This
	  will enable the cache at start up if it hasn't already been enabled
	  by the bootloader.

	  If the bootloader enables the L2 you must press y here to ensure the
	  kernel takes the appropriate actions to keep the cache coherent.
