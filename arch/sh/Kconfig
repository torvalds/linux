	---help---
	  Computers built with Hitachi SuperH processors always
	  map the ROM starting at address zero.  But the processor
	  does not specify the range that RAM takes.

	  The physical memory (RAM) start address will be automatically
	  set to 08000000. Other platforms, such as the Solution Engine
	  boards typically map RAM at 0C000000.

	  Tweak this only when porting to a new machine which does not
	  already have a defconfig. Changing it from the known correct
	  value on any of the known systems will only lead to disaster.

config MEMORY_SIZE
	hex "Physical memory size"

	help
	  This sets the default memory size assumed by your SH kernel. It can
	  be overridden as normal by the 'mem=' argument on the kernel command

	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
	  but it is indepedent of the system firmware.  And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similiarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you.  It may help to enable device hotplugging
	  support.  As of this writing the exact hardware interface is
	  strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be made.

	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
	  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below.

	  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.txt>,
	  <file:Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt> and the SMP-HOWTO available

	  This allows you to specify the maximum number of CPUs which this
