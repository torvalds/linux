	help
	  This allows you to specify the number of channels that the on-chip
	  DMAC supports. This will be 4 for SH7750/SH7751 and 8 for the
	  SH7750R/SH7751R.

config NR_DMA_CHANNELS_BOOL
	depends on SH_DMA
	bool "Override default number of maximum DMA channels"
	help
	  This allows you to forcibly update the maximum number of supported
	  DMA channels for a given board. If this is unset, this will default
	  to the number of channels that the on-chip DMAC has.

config NR_DMA_CHANNELS
	int "Maximum number of DMA channels"
	depends on SH_DMA && NR_DMA_CHANNELS_BOOL
	default NR_ONCHIP_DMA_CHANNELS
	help
	  This allows you to specify the maximum number of DMA channels to
	  support. Setting this to a higher value allows for cascading DMACs
	  with additional channels.

config SH_DMABRG
	bool "SH7760 DMABRG support"
	depends on CPU_SUBTYPE_SH7760
	help
	  The DMABRG does data transfers from main memory to Audio/USB units
	  of the SH7760.
	  Say Y if you want to use Audio/USB DMA on your SH7760 board.
