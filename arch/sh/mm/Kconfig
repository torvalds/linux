	help
	  Some SH processors (such as SH-2/SH-2A) lack an MMU. In order to
	  boot on these systems, this option must not be set.

	  On other systems (such as the SH-3 and 4) where an MMU exists,
	  turning this off will boot the kernel on these machines with the
	  MMU implicitly switched off.

	hex "Physical memory start address"

	---help---
	  Computers built with Hitachi SuperH processors always
	  map the ROM starting at address zero.  But the processor
	  does not specify the range that RAM takes.

	  The physical memory (RAM) start address will be automatically
	  set to 08000000. Other platforms, such as the Solution Engine
	  boards typically map RAM at 0C000000.

	  Tweak this only when porting to a new machine which does not
	  already have a defconfig. Changing it from the known correct
	  value on any of the known systems will only lead to disaster.

config MEMORY_SIZE
	hex "Physical memory size"
	default "0x00400000"
	help
	  This sets the default memory size assumed by your SH kernel. It can
	  be overridden as normal by the 'mem=' argument on the kernel command
	  line. If unsure, consult your board specifications or just leave it
	  as 0x00400000 which was the default value before this became

	  29-bit physical addressing will be used.

config X2TLB

	  Selecting this option will enable the extended mode of the SH-X2

	  This will enable support for the kernel mapping a vDSO page

	  to the libc through the ELF auxiliary vector.

	  From the kernel side this is used for the signal trampoline.
