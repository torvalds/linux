config MMU
        bool "Support for memory management hardware"
	depends on !CPU_SH2
	default y
	help
	  Some SH processors (such as SH-2/SH-2A) lack an MMU. In order to
	  boot on these systems, this option must not be set.

	  On other systems (such as the SH-3 and 4) where an MMU exists,
	  turning this off will boot the kernel on these machines with the
	  MMU implicitly switched off.

config PAGE_OFFSET

	default "0x80000000" if MMU && SUPERH32
	default "0x20000000" if MMU && SUPERH64

config MEMORY_START
	hex "Physical memory start address"
	default "0x08000000"
	---help---
	  Computers built with Hitachi SuperH processors always
	  map the ROM starting at address zero.  But the processor
	  does not specify the range that RAM takes.

	  The physical memory (RAM) start address will be automatically
	  set to 08000000. Other platforms, such as the Solution Engine
	  boards typically map RAM at 0C000000.

	  Tweak this only when porting to a new machine which does not
	  already have a defconfig. Changing it from the known correct
	  value on any of the known systems will only lead to disaster.

config MEMORY_SIZE
	hex "Physical memory size"
	default "0x04000000"
	help
	  This sets the default memory size assumed by your SH kernel. It can
	  be overridden as normal by the 'mem=' argument on the kernel command
	  line. If unsure, consult your board specifications or just leave it
	  as 0x04000000 which was the default value before this became
	  configurable.

	select 32BIT
	default y
	help
	  If you say Y here, physical addressing will be extended to
	  32-bits through the SH-4A PMB. If this is not set, legacy
	  29-bit physical addressing will be used.

config X2TLB
	bool "Enable extended TLB mode"
	depends on (CPU_SHX2 || CPU_SHX3) && MMU && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Selecting this option will enable the extended mode of the SH-X2
	  TLB. For legacy SH-X behaviour and interoperability, say N. For
	  all of the fun new features and a willingless to submit bug reports,
	  say Y.

config VSYSCALL
	bool "Support vsyscall page"
	depends on MMU && (CPU_SH3 || CPU_SH4)
	default y
	help
	  This will enable support for the kernel mapping a vDSO page
	  in process space, and subsequently handing down the entry point
	  to the libc through the ELF auxiliary vector.

	  From the kernel side this is used for the signal trampoline.
	  For systems with an MMU that can afford to give up a page,
	  (the default value) say Y.

config NUMA
	bool "Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) Support"
	depends on MMU && SYS_SUPPORTS_NUMA && EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	help
	  Some SH systems have many various memories scattered around
	  the address space, each with varying latencies. This enables
	  support for these blocks by binding them to nodes and allowing
	  memory policies to be used for prioritizing and controlling
	  allocation behaviour.

	  Selecting this option will configure the caches to be direct-mapped,

	  for debugging on platforms with 2 and 4-way caches (SH7750R/SH7751R,

	  Turn this option off for platforms that do not have a direct-mapped

	  Selecting this option will configure the caches in write-through

	  Since there's sill some aliasing issues on SH-4, this option will
	  unfortunately still require the majority of flushing functions to
	  be implemented to deal with aliasing.

	  If unsure, say N.
