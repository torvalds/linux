	  Some SH processors (such as SH-2/SH-2A) lack an MMU. In order to
	  boot on these systems, this option must not be set.

	  On other systems (such as the SH-3 and 4) where an MMU exists,
	  turning this off will boot the kernel on these machines with the
	  MMU implicitly switched off.

	default "10"
	help
	  The kernel page allocator limits the size of maximal physically
	  contiguous allocations. The limit is called MAX_PAGE:_ORDER and it
	  defines the maximal power of two of number of pages that can be
	  allocated as a single contiguous block. This option allows
	  overriding the default setting when ability to allocate very
	  large blocks of physically contiguous memory is required.

	  The page size is not necessarily 4KB. Keep this in mind when
	  choosing a value for this option.

	  Don't change if unsure.

config MEMORY_START
	hex "Physical memory start address"
	default "0x08000000"
	help
	  Computers built with Hitachi SuperH processors always
	  map the ROM starting at address zero.  But the processor
	  does not specify the range that RAM takes.

	  The physical memory (RAM) start address will be automatically
	  set to 08000000. Other platforms, such as the Solution Engine
	  boards typically map RAM at 0C000000.

	  Tweak this only when porting to a new machine which does not
	  already have a defconfig. Changing it from the known correct
	  value on any of the known systems will only lead to disaster.

config MEMORY_SIZE
	hex "Physical memory size"
	default "0x04000000"
	help
	  This sets the default memory size assumed by your SH kernel. It can
	  be overridden as normal by the 'mem=' argument on the kernel command
	  line. If unsure, consult your board specifications or just leave it
	  as 0x04000000 which was the default value before this became
	  configurable.

	  If you say Y here, physical addressing will be extended to

	help
	  This will enable support for the kernel mapping a vDSO page
	  in process space, and subsequently handing down the entry point
	  to the libc through the ELF auxiliary vector.

	  From the kernel side this is used for the signal trampoline.
	  For systems with an MMU that can afford to give up a page,
	  (the default value) say Y.

	  Some SH systems have many various memories scattered around
	  the address space, each with varying latencies. This enables
	  support for these blocks by binding them to nodes and allowing
	  memory policies to be used for prioritizing and controlling
	  allocation behaviour.

	  Selecting this option will configure the caches in write-through
