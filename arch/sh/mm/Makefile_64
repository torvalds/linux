# Special flags for fault_64.o.  This puts restrictions on the number of
# caller-save registers that the compiler can target when building this file.
# This is required because the code is called from a context in entry.S where
# very few registers have been saved in the exception handler (for speed
# reasons).
# The caller save registers that have been saved and which can be used are
# r2,r3,r4,r5 : argument passing
# r15, r18 : SP and LINK
# tr0-4 : allow all caller-save TR's.  The compiler seems to be able to make
#         use of them, so it's probably beneficial to performance to save them
#         and have them available for it.
#
# The resources not listed below are callee save, i.e. the compiler is free to
# use any of them and will spill them to the stack itself.
