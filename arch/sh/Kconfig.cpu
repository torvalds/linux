choice
	prompt "Endianness selection" 
	default CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN
	help
	  Some SuperH machines can be configured for either little or big
	  endian byte order. These modes require different kernels.

config CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN
	bool "Little Endian"

config CPU_BIG_ENDIAN
	bool "Big Endian"

endchoice

config SH_FPU
	def_bool y
	prompt "FPU support"
	depends on CPU_HAS_FPU
	help
	  Selecting this option will enable support for SH processors that
	  have FPU units (ie, SH77xx).

	  This option must be set in order to enable the FPU.

config SH_FPU_EMU
	def_bool n
	prompt "FPU emulation support"
	depends on !SH_FPU
	help
	  Selecting this option will enable support for software FPU emulation.
	  Most SH-3 users will want to say Y here, whereas most SH-4 users will
	  want to say N.

config SH_DSP
	def_bool y
	prompt "DSP support"
	depends on CPU_HAS_DSP
	help
	  Selecting this option will enable support for SH processors that
	  have DSP units (ie, SH2-DSP, SH3-DSP, and SH4AL-DSP).

	  This option must be set in order to enable the DSP.

config SH_ADC
	def_bool y
	prompt "ADC support"
	depends on CPU_SH3
	help
	  Selecting this option will allow the Linux kernel to use SH3 on-chip
	  ADC module.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SH_STORE_QUEUES
	bool "Support for Store Queues"
	depends on CPU_SH4
	help
	  Selecting this option will enable an in-kernel API for manipulating
	  the store queues integrated in the SH-4 processors.

config SPECULATIVE_EXECUTION
	bool "Speculative subroutine return"
	depends on CPU_SUBTYPE_SH7780 || CPU_SUBTYPE_SH7785 || CPU_SUBTYPE_SH7786
	help
	  This enables support for a speculative instruction fetch for
	  subroutine return. There are various pitfalls associated with
	  this, as outlined in the SH7780 hardware manual.

	  If unsure, say N.

config CPU_HAS_INTEVT
	bool

config CPU_HAS_IPR_IRQ
	bool

config CPU_HAS_SR_RB
	bool
	help
	  This will enable the use of SR.RB register bank usage. Processors
	  that are lacking this bit must have another method in place for
	  accomplishing what is taken care of by the banked registers.

	  See <file:Documentation/sh/register-banks.txt> for further
	  information on SR.RB and register banking in the kernel in general.
