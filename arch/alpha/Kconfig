	  There are two different types of booting firmware on Alphas: SRM,
	  which is command line driven, and ARC, which uses menus and arrow
	  keys. Details about the Linux/Alpha booting process are contained in
	  the Linux/Alpha FAQ, accessible on the WWW from
	  <http://www.alphalinux.org/>.

	  The usual way to load Linux on an Alpha machine is to use MILO
	  (a bootloader that lets you pass command line parameters to the
	  kernel just like lilo does for the x86 architecture) which can be
	  loaded either from ARC or can be installed directly as a permanent
	  firmware replacement from floppy (which requires changing a certain
	  jumper on the motherboard). If you want to do either of these, say N
	  here. If MILO doesn't work on your system (true for Jensen
	  motherboards), you can bypass it altogether and boot Linux directly
	  from an SRM console; say Y here in order to do that. Note that you
	  won't be able to boot from an IDE disk using SRM.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  machine check printing was turned off, then one would choose
	  the printing mode to be 0. Then, upon reboot, one could add
	  the boot command line "verbose_mcheck=1" to get the normal
	  verbose machine check printing, or "verbose_mcheck=2" to get
	  the maximum information available.
