	  Say Y here to disable branch prediction.  If unsure, say N.

config TLS_REG_EMUL
	bool
	help
	  An SMP system using a pre-ARMv6 processor (there are apparently
	  a few prototypes like that in existence) and therefore access to
	  that required register must be emulated.

config NEEDS_SYSCALL_FOR_CMPXCHG
	bool

	  SMP on a pre-ARMv6 processor?  Well OK then.
	  Forget about fast user space cmpxchg support.
	  It is just not possible.

config DMA_CACHE_RWFO
	bool "Enable read/write for ownership DMA cache maintenance"
	depends on CPU_V6 && SMP
	default y
	help
	  The Snoop Control Unit on ARM11MPCore does not detect the
	  cache maintenance operations and the dma_{map,unmap}_area()
	  functions may leave stale cache entries on other CPUs. By
	  enabling this option, Read or Write For Ownership in the ARMv6
	  DMA cache maintenance functions is performed. These LDR/STR
	  instructions change the cache line state to shared or modified
	  so that the cache operation has the desired effect.

	  Note that the workaround is only valid on processors that do
	  not perform speculative loads into the D-cache. For such
	  processors, if cache maintenance operations are not broadcast
	  in hardware, other workarounds are needed (e.g. cache
	  maintenance broadcasting in software via FIQ).

	help
	  Historically, the kernel has used strongly ordered mappings to
	  provide DMA coherent memory.  With the advent of ARMv7, mapping
	  memory with differing types results in unpredictable behaviour,
	  so on these CPUs, this option is forced on.

	  Multiple mappings with differing attributes is also unpredictable
	  on ARMv6 CPUs, but since they do not have aggressive speculative
	  prefetch, no harm appears to occur.

	  However, drivers may be missing the necessary barriers for ARMv6,
	  and therefore turning this on may result in unpredictable driver
	  behaviour.  Therefore, we offer this as an option.

	  You are recommended say 'Y' here and debug any affected drivers.

config ARCH_HAS_BARRIERS
	bool
	help
	  This option allows the use of custom mandatory barriers
	  included via the mach/barriers.h file.
