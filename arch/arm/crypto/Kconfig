	  GCM GHASH function (NIST SP800-38D)

	  Architecture: arm using
	  - PMULL (Polynomial Multiply Long) instructions
	  - NEON (Advanced SIMD) extensions
	  - ARMv8 Crypto Extensions

	  Use an implementation of GHASH (used by the GCM AEAD chaining mode)
	  that uses the 64x64 to 128 bit polynomial multiplication (vmull.p64)
	  that is part of the ARMv8 Crypto Extensions, or a slower variant that
	  uses the vmull.p8 instruction that is part of the basic NEON ISA.

	  Length-preserving ciphers: AES cipher algorithms (FIPS-197)
	  with block cipher modes:
	   - ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode (NIST SP800-38A)
	   - CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode (NIST SP800-38A)
	   - CTR (Counter) mode (NIST SP800-38A)
	   - XTS (XOR Encrypt XOR with ciphertext stealing) mode (NIST SP800-38E
	     and IEEE 1619)

	  Bit sliced AES gives around 45% speedup on Cortex-A15 for CTR mode
	  and for XTS mode encryption, CBC and XTS mode decryption speedup is
	  around 25%. (CBC encryption speed is not affected by this driver.)

	  The bit sliced AES code does not use lookup tables, so it is believed
	  to be invulnerable to cache timing attacks. However, since the bit
	  sliced AES code cannot process single blocks efficiently, in certain
	  cases table-based code with some countermeasures against cache timing
	  attacks will still be used as a fallback method; specifically CBC
	  encryption (not CBC decryption), the encryption of XTS tweaks, XTS
	  ciphertext stealing when the message isn't a multiple of 16 bytes, and
	  CTR when invoked in a context in which NEON instructions are unusable.
