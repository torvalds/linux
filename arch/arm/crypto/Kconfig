	  Architecture: arm

	  On ARM processors without the Crypto Extensions, this is the
	  fastest AES implementation for single blocks.  For multiple
	  blocks, the NEON bit-sliced implementation is usually faster.

	  This implementation may be vulnerable to cache timing attacks,
	  since it uses lookup tables.  However, as countermeasures it
	  disables IRQs and preloads the tables; it is hoped this makes
	  such attacks very difficult.

	  Length-preserving ciphers: AES cipher algorithms (FIPS-197)
	  with block cipher modes:
	   - ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode (NIST SP800-38A)
	   - CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode (NIST SP800-38A)
	   - CTR (Counter) mode (NIST SP800-38A)
	   - XTS (XOR Encrypt XOR with ciphertext stealing) mode (NIST SP800-38E
	     and IEEE 1619)

	  Bit sliced AES gives around 45% speedup on Cortex-A15 for CTR mode
	  and for XTS mode encryption, CBC and XTS mode decryption speedup is
	  around 25%. (CBC encryption speed is not affected by this driver.)

	  The bit sliced AES code does not use lookup tables, so it is believed
	  to be invulnerable to cache timing attacks. However, since the bit
	  sliced AES code cannot process single blocks efficiently, in certain
	  cases table-based code with some countermeasures against cache timing
	  attacks will still be used as a fallback method; specifically CBC
	  encryption (not CBC decryption), the encryption of XTS tweaks, XTS
	  ciphertext stealing when the message isn't a multiple of 16 bytes, and
	  CTR when invoked in a context in which NEON instructions are unusable.
