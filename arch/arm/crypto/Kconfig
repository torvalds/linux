	  Use optimized AES assembler routines for ARM platforms.

	  AES cipher algorithms (FIPS-197). AES uses the Rijndael
	  algorithm.

	  Rijndael appears to be consistently a very good performer in
	  both hardware and software across a wide range of computing
	  environments regardless of its use in feedback or non-feedback
	  modes. Its key setup time is excellent, and its key agility is
	  good. Rijndael's very low memory requirements make it very well
	  suited for restricted-space environments, in which it also
	  demonstrates excellent performance. Rijndael's operations are
	  among the easiest to defend against power and timing attacks.

	  The AES specifies three key sizes: 128, 192 and 256 bits

	  See <http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/> for more information.

	help
	  Use a faster and more secure NEON based implementation of AES in CBC,
	  CTR and XTS modes

	  Bit sliced AES gives around 45% speedup on Cortex-A15 for CTR mode
	  and for XTS mode encryption, CBC and XTS mode decryption speedup is
	  around 25%. (CBC encryption speed is not affected by this driver.)
	  This implementation does not rely on any lookup tables so it is
	  believed to be invulnerable to cache timing attacks.
