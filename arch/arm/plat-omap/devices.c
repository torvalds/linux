 *  (c) Creating platform devices as meaningful on this board and
 *	with this kernel configuration.
 *
 * Claiming GPIOs, and setting their direction and initial values, is the
 * responsibility of the device drivers.  So is responding to probe().
 *
 * Board-specific knowledge like creating devices or pin setup is to be
 * kept out of drivers as much as possible.  In particular, pin setup
 * may be handled by the boot loader, and drivers should expect it will
 * normally have been done by the time they're probed.
