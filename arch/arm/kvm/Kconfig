	  Say Y here to get to see options for using your Linux host to run
	  other operating systems inside virtual machines (guests).
	  This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and
	  disabled.

	  Support hosting virtualized guest machines. You will also
	  need to select one or more of the processor modules below.

	  This module provides access to the hardware capabilities through
	  a character device node named /dev/kvm.

	  If unsure, say N.

	int "Number maximum supported virtual CPUs per VM"
	depends on KVM_ARM_HOST
	default 4
	help
	  Static number of max supported virtual CPUs per VM.

	  If you choose a high number, the vcpu structures will be quite
	  large, so only choose a reasonable number that you expect to
	  actually use.
