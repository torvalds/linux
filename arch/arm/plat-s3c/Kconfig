config S3C_BOOT_WATCHDOG
	bool "S3C Initialisation watchdog"
	depends on S3C2410_WATCHDOG
	help
	  Say y to enable the watchdog during the kernel decompression
	  stage. If the kernel fails to uncompress, then the watchdog
	  will trigger a reset and the system should restart.

config S3C_BOOT_ERROR_RESET
	bool "S3C Reboot on decompression error"
	help
	  Say y here to use the watchdog to reset the system if the
	  kernel decompressor detects an error during decompression.

       bool "Force UART FIFO on during boot process"
       default y
       help
         Say Y here to force the UART FIFOs on during the kernel

config S3C2410_PM_DEBUG
	bool "S3C2410 PM Suspend debug"
	depends on PM
	help
	  Say Y here if you want verbose debugging from the PM Suspend and
	  Resume code. See <file:Documentation/arm/Samsung-S3C24XX/Suspend.txt>
	  for more information.

config S3C_PM_DEBUG_LED_SMDK
       bool "SMDK LED suspend/resume debugging"
       depends on PM && (MACH_SMDK6410)
       help
         Say Y here to enable the use of the SMDK LEDs on the baseboard
	 for debugging of the state of the suspend and resume process.

	 Note, this currently only works for S3C64XX based SMDK boards.

config S3C2410_PM_CHECK
	bool "S3C2410 PM Suspend Memory CRC"
	depends on PM && CRC32
	help
 	  Enable the PM code's memory area checksum over sleep. This option
	  will generate CRCs of all blocks of memory, and store them before
	  going to sleep. The blocks are then checked on resume for any
	  errors.

	  Note, this can take several seconds depending on memory size
	  and CPU speed.

	  See <file:Documentation/arm/Samsung-S3C24XX/Suspend.txt>

	int "S3C2410 PM Suspend CRC Chunksize (KiB)"
	depends on PM && S3C2410_PM_CHECK
	default 64
	help
	  Set the chunksize in Kilobytes of the CRC for checking memory
	  corruption over suspend and resume. A smaller value will mean that
	  the CRC data block will take more memory, but wil identify any
	  faults with better precision.

	  See <file:Documentation/arm/Samsung-S3C24XX/Suspend.txt>

config S3C_LOWLEVEL_UART_PORT

	default 0
	help
	  Choice of which UART port to use for the low-level messages,
	  such as the `Uncompressing...` at start time. The value of
	  this configuration should be between zero and two. The port
	  must have been initialised by the boot-loader before use.

config S3C_GPIO_SPACE
	int "Space between gpio banks"
	default 0
	help
	  Add a number of spare GPIO entries between each bank for debugging
	  purposes. This allows any problems where an counter overflows from
	  one bank to another to be caught, at the expense of using a little
	  more memory.

config S3C_GPIO_TRACK
