	  The ARM series is a line of low-power-consumption RISC chip designs

	  The Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus was

	  The EISA bus provided some of the features of the IBM MicroChannel
	  bus while maintaining backward compatibility with cards made for
	  the older ISA bus.  The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and
	  1995 when it was made obsolete by the PCI bus.

	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor

	default y
	help
	  Enable support for local timers on SMP platforms, rather then the

	  "thundering herd" at every timer tick.

config PREEMPT
	bool "Preemptible Kernel (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
	  real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
	  be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
	  This allows applications to run more reliably even when the system is
	  under load.

	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for a desktop, embedded
	  or real-time system.  Say N if you are unsure.

config NO_IDLE_HZ
	bool "Dynamic tick timer"
	help
	  Select this option if you want to disable continuous timer ticks
	  and have them programmed to occur as required. This option saves
	  power as the system can remain in idle state for longer.

	  By default dynamic tick is disabled during the boot, and can be
	  manually enabled with:

	    echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/timer/timer0/dyn_tick

	  Alternatively, if you want dynamic tick automatically enabled
	  during boot, pass "dyntick=enable" via the kernel command string.

	  Please note that dynamic tick may affect the accuracy of
	  timekeeping on some platforms depending on the implementation.
	  Currently at least OMAP, PXA2xx and SA11x0 platforms are known
	  to have accurate timekeeping with dynamic tick.

config AEABI
	bool "Use the ARM EABI to compile the kernel"
	help
	  This option allows for the kernel to be compiled using the latest
	  ARM ABI (aka EABI).  This is only useful if you are using a user
	  space environment that is also compiled with EABI.

	  Since there are major incompatibilities between the legacy ABI and
	  EABI, especially with regard to structure member alignment, this
	  option also changes the kernel syscall calling convention to
	  disambiguate both ABIs and allow for backward compatibility support
	  (selected with CONFIG_OABI_COMPAT).

	  To use this you need GCC version 4.0.0 or later.

config OABI_COMPAT
	bool "Allow old ABI binaries to run with this kernel"
	depends on AEABI
	default y
	help
	  This option preserves the old syscall interface along with the
	  new (ARM EABI) one. It also provides a compatibility layer to
	  intercept syscalls that have structure arguments which layout
	  in memory differs between the legacy ABI and the new ARM EABI
	  (only for non "thumb" binaries). This option adds a tiny
	  overhead to all syscalls and produces a slightly larger kernel.
	  If you know you'll be using only pure EABI user space then you
	  can say N here. If this option is not selected and you attempt
	  to execute a legacy ABI binary then the result will be
	  UNPREDICTABLE (in fact it can be predicted that it won't work
	  at all). If in doubt say Y.

config ARCH_DISCONTIGMEM_ENABLE
	bool
	default (ARCH_LH7A40X && !LH7A40X_CONTIGMEM)
	help
	  Say Y to support efficient handling of discontiguous physical memory,

	  or have huge holes in the physical address space for other reasons.

	  it has to run directly from flash, so it will take more space to
	  store it.  The flash address used to link the kernel object files,
	  and for storing it, is configuration dependent. Therefore, if you
	  say Y here, you must know the proper physical address where to
	  store the kernel image depending on your own flash memory usage.

	  Also note that the make target becomes "make xipImage" rather than

	  This driver does not spin down disk drives (see the hdparm(8)
