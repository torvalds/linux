/*
 * Hardware-wise, we have a two level page table structure, where the first
 * level has 4096 entries, and the second level has 256 entries.  Each entry
 * is one 32-bit word.  Most of the bits in the second level entry are used
 * by hardware, and there aren't any "accessed" and "dirty" bits.
 *
 * Linux on the other hand has a three level page table structure, which can
 * be wrapped to fit a two level page table structure easily - using the PGD
 * and PTE only.  However, Linux also expects one "PTE" table per page, and
 * at least a "dirty" bit.
 *
 * Therefore, we tweak the implementation slightly - we tell Linux that we
 * have 2048 entries in the first level, each of which is 8 bytes (iow, two
 * hardware pointers to the second level.)  The second level contains two
 * hardware PTE tables arranged contiguously, preceded by Linux versions
 * which contain the state information Linux needs.  We, therefore, end up
 * with 512 entries in the "PTE" level.
 *
 * This leads to the page tables having the following layout:
 *
 *    pgd             pte
 * |        |
 * +--------+
 * |        |       +------------+ +0
 * +- - - - +       | Linux pt 0 |
 * |        |       +------------+ +1024
 * +--------+ +0    | Linux pt 1 |
 * |        |-----> +------------+ +2048
 * +- - - - + +4    |  h/w pt 0  |
 * |        |-----> +------------+ +3072
 * +--------+ +8    |  h/w pt 1  |
 * |        |       +------------+ +4096
 *
 * See L_PTE_xxx below for definitions of bits in the "Linux pt", and
 * PTE_xxx for definitions of bits appearing in the "h/w pt".
 *
 * PMD_xxx definitions refer to bits in the first level page table.
 *
 * The "dirty" bit is emulated by only granting hardware write permission
 * iff the page is marked "writable" and "dirty" in the Linux PTE.  This
 * means that a write to a clean page will cause a permission fault, and
 * the Linux MM layer will mark the page dirty via handle_pte_fault().
 * For the hardware to notice the permission change, the TLB entry must
 * be flushed, and ptep_set_access_flags() does that for us.
 *
 * The "accessed" or "young" bit is emulated by a similar method; we only
 * allow accesses to the page if the "young" bit is set.  Accesses to the
 * page will cause a fault, and handle_pte_fault() will set the young bit
 * for us as long as the page is marked present in the corresponding Linux
 * PTE entry.  Again, ptep_set_access_flags() will ensure that the TLB is
 * up to date.
 *
 * However, when the "young" bit is cleared, we deny access to the page
 * by clearing the hardware PTE.  Currently Linux does not flush the TLB
 * for us in this case, which means the TLB will retain the transation
 * until either the TLB entry is evicted under pressure, or a context
 * switch which changes the user space mapping occurs.
