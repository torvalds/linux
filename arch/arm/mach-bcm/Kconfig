	  This enables support for systems based on Broadcom IPROC architected SoCs.
	  The IPROC complex contains one or more ARM CPUs along with common

	  uArchitecture containing peripherals outside of the IPROC complex.
	  Currently supported SoCs are Cygnus.

	  Support for Broadcom Northstar Plus SoC.
	  Broadcom Northstar Plus family of SoCs are used for switching control
	  and management applications as well as residential router/gateway
	  applications. The SoC features dual core Cortex A9 ARM CPUs,
	  integrating several peripheral interfaces including multiple Gigabit
	  Ethernet PHYs, DDR3 memory, PCIE Gen-2, USB 2.0 and USB 3.0, serial and
	  NAND flash, SATA and several other IO controllers.

	  Support for Broadcom BCM470X and BCM5301X SoCs with ARM CPU cores.

	  This is a network SoC line mostly used in home routers and
	  wifi access points, it's internal name is Northstar.
	  This inclused the following SoC: BCM53010, BCM53011, BCM53012,
	  BCM53014, BCM53015, BCM53016, BCM53017, BCM53018, BCM4707,

	  Do not confuse this with the BCM4760 which is a totally
	  different SoC or with the older BCM47XX and BCM53XX based
	  network SoC using a MIPS CPU, they are supported by arch/mips/bcm47xx
