 * Note: this Device Tree assumes that the bootloader has remapped the
 * internal registers to 0xf1000000 (instead of the old 0xd0000000).
 * The 0xf1000000 is the default used by the recent, DT-capable, U-Boot
 * bootloaders provided by Marvell. It is used in recent versions of
 * DSM software provided by Synology. Nonetheless, some earlier boards
 * were delivered with an older version of u-boot that left internal
 * registers mapped at 0xd0000000. If you have such a device you will
 * not be able to directly boot a kernel based on this Device Tree. In
 * that case, the preferred solution is to update your bootloader (e.g.
 * by upgrading to latest version of DSM, or building a new one and
 * installing it from u-boot prompt) or adjust the Devive Tree
 * (s/0xf1000000/0xd0000000/ in 'ranges' below).
