	  Provides common dependencies for Versatile Express platforms

	  tile support or Flattened Device Tree based support options.

	  New Versatile Express platforms require Flattened Device Tree to
	  be passed to the kernel.

	  This option enables support for systems using Cortex processor based
	  ARM core and logic (FPGA) tiles on the Versatile Express motherboard,
	  for example:

	  - CoreTile Express A5x2 (V2P-CA5s)
	  - CoreTile Express A9x4 (V2P-CA9)
	  - CoreTile Express A15x2 (V2P-CA15)
	  - LogicTile Express 13MG (V2F-2XV6) with A5, A7, A9 or A15 SMMs
	    (Soft Macrocell Models)
	  - Versatile Express RTSMs (Models)

	  You must boot using a Flattened Device Tree in order to use these
	  platforms. The traditional (ATAGs) boot method is not usable on
	  these boards with this option.

	  If your bootloader supports Flattened Device Tree based booting,
	  say Y here.
