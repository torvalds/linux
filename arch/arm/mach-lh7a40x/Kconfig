	help
	  Say Y here if your bootloader sets the SROMLL bit(s) in
	  the SDRAM controller, organizing memory as a contiguous
	  array.  This option will disable CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM and
          force the kernel to manage all memory in one node.

	  Setting this option incorrectly may prevent the kernel from
	  booting.  It is OK to leave it N.

	  For more information, consult
	    <file:Documentation/arm/Sharp-LH/SDRAM>.

	help
	  Say Y here to produce compact memory node tables.  By
	  default pairs of adjacent physical RAM banks are managed
	  together in a single node, incurring some wasted overhead
	  in the node tables, however also maintaining compatibility
	  with systems where physical memory is truly contiguous.

	  Setting this option incorrectly may prevent the kernel from
	  booting.  It is OK to leave it N.
