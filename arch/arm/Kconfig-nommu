config SET_MEM_PARAM
	bool "Set flash/sdram size and base addr"
	help
	 Say Y to manually set the base addresses and sizes.
	 otherwise, the default values are assigned.

config DRAM_BASE
	hex '(S)DRAM Base Address' if SET_MEM_PARAM
	default 0x00800000

config DRAM_SIZE
	hex '(S)DRAM SIZE' if SET_MEM_PARAM
	default 0x00800000

config FLASH_MEM_BASE

config PROCESSOR_ID
	hex 'Hard wire the processor ID'
	default 0x00007700
	depends on !(CPU_CP15 || CPU_V7M)
	help
	  If processor has no CP15 register, this processor ID is
	  used instead of the auto-probing which utilizes the register.

config REMAP_VECTORS_TO_RAM
	bool 'Install vectors to the beginning of RAM'
	help
	  The kernel needs to change the hardware exception vectors.
	  In nommu mode, the hardware exception vectors are normally
	  placed at address 0x00000000. However, this region may be
	  occupied by read-only memory depending on H/W design.

	  If the region contains read-write memory, say 'n' here.

	  If your CPU provides a remap facility which allows the exception
	  vectors to be mapped to writable memory, say 'n' here.

	  Otherwise, say 'y' here.  In this case, the kernel will require
	  external support to redirect the hardware exception vectors to
	  the writable versions located at DRAM_BASE.

config ARM_MPU
       bool 'Use the ARM v7 PMSA Compliant MPU'
       depends on CPU_V7
       default y
       help
         Some ARM systems without an MMU have instead a Memory Protection
         Unit (MPU) that defines the type and permissions for regions of
         memory.

         If your CPU has an MPU then you should choose 'y' here unless you
         know that you do not want to use the MPU.
