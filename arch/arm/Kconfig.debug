config STRICT_DEVMEM
	bool "Filter access to /dev/mem"
	depends on MMU
	---help---
	  If this option is disabled, you allow userspace (root) access to all
	  of memory, including kernel and userspace memory. Accidental
	  access to this is obviously disastrous, but specific access can
	  be used by people debugging the kernel.

	  If this option is switched on, the /dev/mem file only allows
	  userspace access to memory mapped peripherals.

          If in doubt, say Y.

# RMK wants arm kernels compiled with frame pointers or stack unwinding.
# If you know what you are doing and are willing to live without stack
# traces, you can get a slightly smaller kernel by setting this option to
# n, but then RMK will have to kill you ;).
config FRAME_POINTER
	bool
	depends on !THUMB2_KERNEL
	default y if !ARM_UNWIND || FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER
	help
	  If you say N here, the resulting kernel will be slightly smaller and
	  faster. However, if neither FRAME_POINTER nor ARM_UNWIND are enabled,
	  when a problem occurs with the kernel, the information that is
	  reported is severely limited.

config ARM_UNWIND
	bool "Enable stack unwinding support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on AEABI
	default y
	help
	  This option enables stack unwinding support in the kernel
	  using the information automatically generated by the
	  compiler. The resulting kernel image is slightly bigger but
	  the performance is not affected. Currently, this feature
	  only works with EABI compilers. If unsure say Y.

config OLD_MCOUNT
	bool
	depends on FUNCTION_TRACER && FRAME_POINTER
	default y

config DEBUG_USER
	bool "Verbose user fault messages"
	help
	  When a user program crashes due to an exception, the kernel can
	  print a brief message explaining what the problem was. This is
	  sometimes helpful for debugging but serves no purpose on a
	  production system. Most people should say N here.

	  In addition, you need to pass user_debug=N on the kernel command
	  line to enable this feature.  N consists of the sum of:

	      1 - undefined instruction events
	      2 - system calls
	      4 - invalid data aborts
	      8 - SIGSEGV faults
	     16 - SIGBUS faults

config DEBUG_RODATA
	bool "Write protect kernel text section"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && MMU
	---help---
	  Mark the kernel text section as write-protected in the pagetables,
	  in order to catch accidental (and incorrect) writes to such const
	  data. This will cause the size of the kernel, plus up to 4MB, to
	  be mapped as pages instead of sections, which will increase TLB
	  pressure.
	  If in doubt, say "N".

config DEBUG_RODATA_TEST
	bool "Testcase for the DEBUG_RODATA feature"
	depends on DEBUG_RODATA
	default n
	---help---
	  This option enables a testcase for the DEBUG_RODATA
	  feature.
	  If in doubt, say "N"

# These options are only for real kernel hackers who want to get their hands dirty.
config DEBUG_LL
	bool "Kernel low-level debugging functions (read help!)"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to include definitions of printascii, printch, printhex
	  in the kernel.  This is helpful if you are debugging code that
	  executes before the console is initialized.

	  Note that selecting this option will limit the kernel to a single
	  UART definition, as specified below. Attempting to boot the kernel
	  image on a different platform *will not work*, so this option should
	  not be enabled for kernels that are intended to be portable.

config PID_IN_CONTEXTIDR
	bool "Write the current PID to the CONTEXTIDR register"
	depends on CPU_COPY_V6
	help
	  Enabling this option causes the kernel to write the current PID to
	  the PROCID field of the CONTEXTIDR register, at the expense of some
	  additional instructions during context switch. Say Y here only if you
	  are planning to use hardware trace tools with this kernel.
