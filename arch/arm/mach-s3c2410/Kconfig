config S3C2410_BOOT_WATCHDOG
	bool "S3C2410 Initialisation watchdog"
	depends on ARCH_S3C2410 && S3C2410_WATCHDOG
	help
	  Say y to enable the watchdog during the kernel decompression
	  stage. If the kernel fails to uncompress, then the watchdog
	  will trigger a reset and the system should restart.

	  Although this uses the same hardware unit as the kernel watchdog
	  driver, it is not a replacement for it. If you use this option,
	  you will have to use the watchdg driver to either stop the timeout
	  or restart it. If you do not, then your kernel will reboot after
	  startup.

	  The driver uses a fixed timeout value, so the exact time till the
	  system resets depends on the value of PCLK. The timeout on an
	  200MHz s3c2410 should be about 30 seconds.

config S3C2410_DMA

	  S3C2410 DMA support. This is needed for drivers like sound which

	  peripheral blocks.

config S3C2410_DMA_DEBUG
	bool "S3C2410 DMA support debug"
	depends on ARCH_S3C2410 && S3C2410_DMA
	help
	  Enable debugging output for the DMA code. This option sends info
	  to the kernel log, at priority KERN_DEBUG.

	  Note, it is easy to create and fill the log buffer in a small
	  amount of time, as well as using an significant percentage of
	  the CPU time doing so.

	bool "S3C2410 PM Suspend Memory CRC"
	depends on ARCH_S3C2410 && PM && CRC32
	help
 	  Enable the PM code's memory area checksum over sleep. This option
	  will generate CRCs of all blocks of memory, and store them before
	  going to sleep. The blocks are then checked on resume for any
	  errors.

	default 64
	help
	  Set the chunksize in Kilobytes of the CRC for checking memory
	  corruption over suspend and resume. A smaller value will mean that
	  the CRC data block will take more memory, but wil identify any
	  faults with better precision.

	  Choice of which UART port to use for the low-level messages,
	  such as the `Uncompressing...` at start time. The value of
	  this configuration should be between zero and two. The port
	  must have been initialised by the boot-loader before use.

	  Note, this does not affect the port used by the debug messages,
	  which is a separate configuration.
