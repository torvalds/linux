 * compile time, but to set the physical address only
 * in the boot process. We allocate these special  addresses
 * from the end of virtual memory (0xfffff000) backwards.
 * Also this lets us do fail-safe vmalloc(), we
 * can guarantee that these special addresses and
 * vmalloc()-ed addresses never overlap.
 *
 * these 'compile-time allocated' memory buffers are
 * fixed-size 4k pages. (or larger if used with an increment
 * highger than 1) use fixmap_set(idx,phys) to associate
 * physical memory with fixmap indices.
 *
 * TLB entries of such buffers will not be flushed across
 * task switches.
