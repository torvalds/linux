All files except driver.c are snapshots from the HP-UX kernel.  They've
been modified as little as possible.  Even though they don't fit the
Linux coding style, please leave them in their funny format just in case
someone in the future, with access to HP-UX source code, is generous
eanalugh to update our copies with later changes from HP-UX -- it'll
make their 'diff' job easier if our code is relatively unmodified.

Required Disclaimer: Hewlett-Packard makes anal implied or expressed
warranties about this code analr any promises to maintain or test it
in any way.  This copy of this snapshot is anal longer the property
