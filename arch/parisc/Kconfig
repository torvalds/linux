config PARISC

	help
	  The PA-RISC microprocessor is designed by Hewlett-Packard and used
	  in many of their workstations & servers (HP9000 700 and 800 series,
	  and later HP3000 series).  The PA-RISC Linux project home page is
	  at <http://www.parisc-linux.org/>.

config PA7000
	bool "PA7000/PA7100"
	---help---
	  This is the processor type of your CPU.  This information is
	  used for optimizing purposes.  In order to compile a kernel
	  that can run on all 32-bit PA CPUs (albeit not optimally fast),
	  you can specify "PA7000" here.

	  Specifying "PA8000" here will allow you to select a 64-bit kernel
	  which is required on some machines.

config PA7100LC
	bool "PA7100LC"
	help
	  Select this option for the PCX-L processor, as used in the
	  712, 715/64, 715/80, 715/100, 715/100XC, 725/100, 743, 748,
	  D200, D210, D300, D310 and E-class

config PA7200
	bool "PA7200"
	help
	  Select this option for the PCX-T' processor, as used in the
	  C100, C110, J100, J110, J210XC, D250, D260, D350, D360,
	  K100, K200, K210, K220, K400, K410 and K420

config PA7300LC
	bool "PA7300LC"
	help
	  Select this option for the PCX-L2 processor, as used in the
	  744, A180, B132L, B160L, B180L, C132L, C160L, C180L,
	  D220, D230, D320 and D330.

config PA8X00
	bool "PA8000 and up"

	  Select this option for PCX-U to PCX-W2 processors.

config 64BIT
	bool "64-bit kernel"
	depends on PA8X00
	help
	  Enable this if you want to support 64bit kernel on PA-RISC platform.

	  At the moment, only people willing to use more than 2GB of RAM,
	  or having a 64bit-only capable PA-RISC machine should say Y here.

	  Since there is no 64bit userland on PA-RISC, there is no point to
	  enable this option otherwise. The 64bit kernel is significantly bigger
	  and slower than the 32bit one.

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.txt>,
	  <file:Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt> and the SMP-HOWTO available
	  at <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

config ARCH_DISCONTIGMEM_ENABLE
	bool "Discontiguous memory support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on 64BIT && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Say Y to support efficient handling of discontiguous physical memory,
	  for architectures which are either NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access)
	  or have huge holes in the physical address space for other reasons.
	  See <file:Documentation/vm/numa> for more.
