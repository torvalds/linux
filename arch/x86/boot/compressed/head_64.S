/*
 * This macro gives the relative virtual address of X, i.e. the offset of X
 * from startup_32. This is the same as the link-time virtual address of X,
 * since startup_32 is at 0, but defining it this way tells the
 * assembler/linker that we do not want the actual run-time address of X. This
 * prevents the linker from trying to create unwanted run-time relocation
 * entries for the reference when the compressed kernel is linked as PIE.
 *
 * A reference X(%reg) will result in the link-time VA of X being stored with
 * the instruction, and a run-time R_X86_64_RELATIVE relocation entry that
 * adds the 64-bit base address where the kernel is loaded.
 *
 * Replacing it with (X-startup_32)(%reg) results in the offset being stored,
 * and no run-time relocation.
 *
 * The macro should be used as a displacement with a base register containing
 * the run-time address of startup_32 [i.e. rva(X)(%reg)], or as an immediate
 * [$ rva(X)].
 *
 * This macro can only be used from within the .head.text section, since the
 * expression requires startup_32 to be in the same section as the code being
 * assembled.
