	depends on X86_32 && PM_SLEEP && !X86_VISWS
	---help---
	  APM is a BIOS specification for saving power using several different
	  techniques. This is mostly useful for battery powered laptops with
	  APM compliant BIOSes. If you say Y here, the system time will be
	  reset after a RESUME operation, the /proc/apm device will provide
	  battery status information, and user-space programs will receive
	  notification of APM "events" (e.g. battery status change).

	  If you select "Y" here, you can disable actual use of the APM
	  BIOS by passing the "apm=off" option to the kernel at boot time.

	  Note that the APM support is almost completely disabled for
	  machines with more than one CPU.

	  In order to use APM, you will need supporting software. For location
	  and more information, read <file:Documentation/pm.txt> and the
	  Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver does not spin down disk drives (see the hdparm(8)
	  manpage ("man 8 hdparm") for that), and it doesn't turn off
	  VESA-compliant "green" monitors.

	  This driver does not support the TI 4000M TravelMate and the ACER
	  486/DX4/75 because they don't have compliant BIOSes. Many "green"
	  desktop machines also don't have compliant BIOSes, and this driver
	  may cause those machines to panic during the boot phase.

	  Generally, if you don't have a battery in your machine, there isn't
	  much point in using this driver and you should say N. If you get
	  random kernel OOPSes or reboots that don't seem to be related to
	  anything, try disabling/enabling this option (or disabling/enabling
	  APM in your BIOS).

	  Some other things you should try when experiencing seemingly random,
	  "weird" problems:

	  1) make sure that you have enough swap space and that it is
	  enabled.
	  2) pass the "no-hlt" option to the kernel
	  3) switch on floating point emulation in the kernel and pass
	  the "no387" option to the kernel
	  4) pass the "floppy=nodma" option to the kernel
	  5) pass the "mem=4M" option to the kernel (thereby disabling
	  all but the first 4 MB of RAM)
	  6) make sure that the CPU is not over clocked.
	  7) read the sig11 FAQ at <http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/>
	  8) disable the cache from your BIOS settings
	  9) install a fan for the video card or exchange video RAM
	  10) install a better fan for the CPU
	  11) exchange RAM chips
	  12) exchange the motherboard.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called apm.

config APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND
	bool "Ignore USER SUSPEND"
	help
	  This option will ignore USER SUSPEND requests. On machines with a
	  compliant APM BIOS, you want to say N. However, on the NEC Versa M
	  series notebooks, it is necessary to say Y because of a BIOS bug.

config APM_DO_ENABLE
	bool "Enable PM at boot time"
	---help---
	  Enable APM features at boot time. From page 36 of the APM BIOS
	  specification: "When disabled, the APM BIOS does not automatically
	  power manage devices, enter the Standby State, enter the Suspend
	  State, or take power saving steps in response to CPU Idle calls."
	  This driver will make CPU Idle calls when Linux is idle (unless this
	  feature is turned off -- see "Do CPU IDLE calls", below). This
	  should always save battery power, but more complicated APM features
	  will be dependent on your BIOS implementation. You may need to turn
	  this option off if your computer hangs at boot time when using APM
	  support, or if it beeps continuously instead of suspending. Turn
	  this off if you have a NEC UltraLite Versa 33/C or a Toshiba
	  T400CDT. This is off by default since most machines do fine without
	  this feature.

config APM_CPU_IDLE
	bool "Make CPU Idle calls when idle"
	help
	  Enable calls to APM CPU Idle/CPU Busy inside the kernel's idle loop.
	  On some machines, this can activate improved power savings, such as
	  a slowed CPU clock rate, when the machine is idle. These idle calls
	  are made after the idle loop has run for some length of time (e.g.,
	  333 mS). On some machines, this will cause a hang at boot time or
	  whenever the CPU becomes idle. (On machines with more than one CPU,
	  this option does nothing.)

config APM_DISPLAY_BLANK
	bool "Enable console blanking using APM"
	help
	  Enable console blanking using the APM. Some laptops can use this to
	  turn off the LCD backlight when the screen blanker of the Linux
	  virtual console blanks the screen. Note that this is only used by
	  the virtual console screen blanker, and won't turn off the backlight
	  when using the X Window system. This also doesn't have anything to
	  do with your VESA-compliant power-saving monitor. Further, this
	  option doesn't work for all laptops -- it might not turn off your
	  backlight at all, or it might print a lot of errors to the console,
	  especially if you are using gpm.

config APM_ALLOW_INTS
	bool "Allow interrupts during APM BIOS calls"
	help
	  Normally we disable external interrupts while we are making calls to
	  the APM BIOS as a measure to lessen the effects of a badly behaving
	  BIOS implementation.  The BIOS should reenable interrupts if it
	  needs to.  Unfortunately, some BIOSes do not -- especially those in
	  many of the newer IBM Thinkpads.  If you experience hangs when you
	  suspend, try setting this to Y.  Otherwise, say N.

config APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF
	bool "Use real mode APM BIOS call to power off"
	help
	  Use real mode APM BIOS calls to switch off the computer. This is
	  a work-around for a number of buggy BIOSes. Switch this option on if
	  your computer crashes instead of powering off properly.
