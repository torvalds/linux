	  Linux can use up to 64 Gigabytes of physical memory on x86 systems.
	  However, the address space of 32-bit x86 processors is only 4
	  Gigabytes large. That means that, if you have a large amount of
	  physical memory, not all of it can be "permanently mapped" by the
	  kernel. The physical memory that's not permanently mapped is called
	  "high memory".

	  If you are compiling a kernel which will never run on a machine with
	  more than 1 Gigabyte total physical RAM, answer "off" here (default
	  choice and suitable for most users). This will result in a "3GB/1GB"
	  split: 3GB are mapped so that each process sees a 3GB virtual memory
	  space and the remaining part of the 4GB virtual memory space is used
	  by the kernel to permanently map as much physical memory as
	  possible.

	  If the machine has between 1 and 4 Gigabytes physical RAM, then
	  answer "4GB" here.

	  If more than 4 Gigabytes is used then answer "64GB" here. This
	  selection turns Intel PAE (Physical Address Extension) mode on.
	  PAE implements 3-level paging on IA32 processors. PAE is fully

	  such as "mem=256M". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of

	  /proc/mtrr file which may be used to manipulate your processor's
	  MTRRs. Typically the X server should use this.

	  This code has a reasonably generic interface so that similar
	  control registers on other processors can be easily supported
	  as well:

	  The Cyrix 6x86, 6x86MX and M II processors have Address Range
	  Registers (ARRs) which provide a similar functionality to MTRRs. For
	  these, the ARRs are used to emulate the MTRRs.
	  The AMD K6-2 (stepping 8 and above) and K6-3 processors have two
	  MTRRs. The Centaur C6 (WinChip) has 8 MCRs, allowing
	  write-combining. All of these processors are supported by this code
	  and it makes sense to say Y here if you have one of them.

	  Saying Y here also fixes a problem with buggy SMP BIOSes which only
	  set the MTRRs for the boot CPU and not for the secondary CPUs. This
	  can lead to all sorts of problems, so it's good to say Y here.

	  You can safely say Y even if your machine doesn't have MTRRs, you'll
	  just add about 9 KB to your kernel.

config CC_STACKPROTECTOR

	  overwrite the canary, which gets detected and the attack is then
	  neutralized via a kernel panic.

	  This feature requires gcc version 4.2 or above, or a distribution
	  gcc with the feature backported. Older versions are automatically
	  detected and for those versions, this configuration option is
	  ignored. (and a warning is printed during bootup)

	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
	  but it is independent of the system firmware.   And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you.  It may help to enable device hotplugging
	  support.  As of this writing the exact hardware interface is
	  strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be made.

config CRASH_DUMP

	---help---
	  Generate crash dump after being started by kexec.
	  This should be normally only set in special crash dump kernels
	  which are loaded in the main kernel with kexec-tools into
	  a specially reserved region and then later executed after
	  a crash by kdump/kexec. The crash dump kernel must be compiled
	  to a memory address not used by the main kernel or BIOS using
	  PHYSICAL_START, or it must be built as a relocatable image
	  (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y).
	  For more details see Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt

config KEXEC_JUMP

config PHYSICAL_START
	hex "Physical address where the kernel is loaded" if (EXPERT || CRASH_DUMP)
	default "0x1000000"
	---help---
	  This gives the physical address where the kernel is loaded.

	  If kernel is a not relocatable (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n) then
	  bzImage will decompress itself to above physical address and
	  run from there. Otherwise, bzImage will run from the address where
	  it has been loaded by the boot loader and will ignore above physical
	  address.

	  In normal kdump cases one does not have to set/change this option
	  as now bzImage can be compiled as a completely relocatable image
	  (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y) and be used to load and run from a different
	  address. This option is mainly useful for the folks who don't want
	  to use a bzImage for capturing the crash dump and want to use a
	  vmlinux instead. vmlinux is not relocatable hence a kernel needs
	  to be specifically compiled to run from a specific memory area
	  (normally a reserved region) and this option comes handy.

	  So if you are using bzImage for capturing the crash dump,
	  leave the value here unchanged to 0x1000000 and set
	  CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y.  Otherwise if you plan to use vmlinux
	  for capturing the crash dump change this value to start of
	  the reserved region.  In other words, it can be set based on
	  the "X" value as specified in the "crashkernel=YM@XM"
	  command line boot parameter passed to the panic-ed
	  kernel. Please take a look at Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt
	  for more details about crash dumps.

	  Usage of bzImage for capturing the crash dump is recommended as
	  one does not have to build two kernels. Same kernel can be used
	  as production kernel and capture kernel. Above option should have
	  gone away after relocatable bzImage support is introduced. But it
	  is present because there are users out there who continue to use
	  vmlinux for dump capture. This option should go away down the
	  line.

	  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.

config RELOCATABLE

	  This builds a kernel image that retains relocation information
	  so it can be loaded someplace besides the default 1MB.
	  The relocations tend to make the kernel binary about 10% larger,
	  but are discarded at runtime.

	  One use is for the kexec on panic case where the recovery kernel
	  must live at a different physical address than the primary
	  kernel.

	  Note: If CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y, then the kernel runs from the address
	  it has been loaded at and the compile time physical address
	  (CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START) is ignored.

	default "0x1000000"

	---help---
	  This value puts the alignment restrictions on physical address
	  where kernel is loaded and run from. Kernel is compiled for an
	  address which meets above alignment restriction.

	  If bootloader loads the kernel at a non-aligned address and
	  CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is set, kernel will move itself to nearest
	  address aligned to above value and run from there.

	  If bootloader loads the kernel at a non-aligned address and
	  CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is not set, kernel will ignore the run time
	  load address and decompress itself to the address it has been
	  compiled for and run from there. The address for which kernel is
	  compiled already meets above alignment restrictions. Hence the
	  end result is that kernel runs from a physical address meeting
	  above alignment restrictions.

	  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config CMDLINE_BOOL
	bool "Built-in kernel command line"
	---help---
	  Allow for specifying boot arguments to the kernel at
	  build time.  On some systems (e.g. embedded ones), it is
	  necessary or convenient to provide some or all of the
	  kernel boot arguments with the kernel itself (that is,
	  to not rely on the boot loader to provide them.)

	  To compile command line arguments into the kernel,
	  set this option to 'Y', then fill in the
	  the boot arguments in CONFIG_CMDLINE.

	  Systems with fully functional boot loaders (i.e. non-embedded)
	  should leave this option set to 'N'.

config CMDLINE
	string "Built-in kernel command string"
	depends on CMDLINE_BOOL
	default ""
	---help---
	  Enter arguments here that should be compiled into the kernel
	  image and used at boot time.  If the boot loader provides a
	  command line at boot time, it is appended to this string to
	  form the full kernel command line, when the system boots.

	  However, you can use the CONFIG_CMDLINE_OVERRIDE option to
	  change this behavior.

	  In most cases, the command line (whether built-in or provided
	  by the boot loader) should specify the device for the root
	  file system.

config CMDLINE_OVERRIDE
	bool "Built-in command line overrides boot loader arguments"
	depends on CMDLINE_BOOL
	---help---
	  Set this option to 'Y' to have the kernel ignore the boot loader
	  command line, and use ONLY the built-in command line.

	  This is used to work around broken boot loaders.  This should
	  be set to 'N' under normal conditions.

	---help---
	  APM is a BIOS specification for saving power using several different
	  techniques. This is mostly useful for battery powered laptops with
	  APM compliant BIOSes. If you say Y here, the system time will be
	  reset after a RESUME operation, the /proc/apm device will provide
	  battery status information, and user-space programs will receive
	  notification of APM "events" (e.g. battery status change).

	  If you select "Y" here, you can disable actual use of the APM
	  BIOS by passing the "apm=off" option to the kernel at boot time.

	  Note that the APM support is almost completely disabled for
	  machines with more than one CPU.

	  In order to use APM, you will need supporting software. For location
	  and more information, read <file:Documentation/power/apm-acpi.txt>
	  and the Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver does not spin down disk drives (see the hdparm(8)
	  manpage ("man 8 hdparm") for that), and it doesn't turn off
	  VESA-compliant "green" monitors.

	  This driver does not support the TI 4000M TravelMate and the ACER
	  486/DX4/75 because they don't have compliant BIOSes. Many "green"
	  desktop machines also don't have compliant BIOSes, and this driver
	  may cause those machines to panic during the boot phase.

	  Generally, if you don't have a battery in your machine, there isn't
	  much point in using this driver and you should say N. If you get
	  random kernel OOPSes or reboots that don't seem to be related to
	  anything, try disabling/enabling this option (or disabling/enabling
	  APM in your BIOS).

	  Some other things you should try when experiencing seemingly random,
	  "weird" problems:

	  1) make sure that you have enough swap space and that it is
	  enabled.
	  2) pass the "no-hlt" option to the kernel
	  3) switch on floating point emulation in the kernel and pass
	  the "no387" option to the kernel
	  4) pass the "floppy=nodma" option to the kernel
	  5) pass the "mem=4M" option to the kernel (thereby disabling
	  all but the first 4 MB of RAM)
	  6) make sure that the CPU is not over clocked.
	  7) read the sig11 FAQ at <http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/>
	  8) disable the cache from your BIOS settings
	  9) install a fan for the video card or exchange video RAM
	  10) install a better fan for the CPU
	  11) exchange RAM chips
	  12) exchange the motherboard.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called apm.

	  specification: "When disabled, the APM BIOS does not automatically
	  power manage devices, enter the Standby State, enter the Suspend
	  State, or take power saving steps in response to CPU Idle calls."
	  This driver will make CPU Idle calls when Linux is idle (unless this
	  feature is turned off -- see "Do CPU IDLE calls", below). This
	  should always save battery power, but more complicated APM features
	  will be dependent on your BIOS implementation. You may need to turn
	  this option off if your computer hangs at boot time when using APM
	  support, or if it beeps continuously instead of suspending. Turn
	  this off if you have a NEC UltraLite Versa 33/C or a Toshiba

	---help---
	  Enable calls to APM CPU Idle/CPU Busy inside the kernel's idle loop.
	  On some machines, this can activate improved power savings, such as
	  a slowed CPU clock rate, when the machine is idle. These idle calls
	  are made after the idle loop has run for some length of time (e.g.,

	---help---
	  This option enables system support for the PCEngines ALIX.
	  At present this just sets up LEDs for GPIO control on
	  ALIX2/3/6 boards.  However, other system specific setup should
	  get added here.

	  Note: You must still enable the drivers for GPIO and LED support
	  (GPIO_CS5535 & LEDS_GPIO) to actually use the LEDs

	  Note: You have to set alix.force=1 for boards with Award BIOS.
