/*
 * The set_memory_* API can be used to change various attributes of a virtual
 * address range. The attributes include:
 * Cacheability  : UnCached, WriteCombining, WriteThrough, WriteBack
 * Executability : eXecutable, NoteXecutable
 * Read/Write    : ReadOnly, ReadWrite
 * Presence      : NotPresent
 * Encryption    : Encrypted, Decrypted
 *
 * Within a category, the attributes are mutually exclusive.
 *
 * The implementation of this API will take care of various aspects that
 * are associated with changing such attributes, such as:
 * - Flushing TLBs
 * - Flushing CPU caches
 * - Making sure aliases of the memory behind the mapping don't violate
 *   coherency rules as defined by the CPU in the system.
 *
 * What this API does not do:
 * - Provide exclusion between various callers - including callers that
 *   operation on other mappings of the same physical page
 * - Restore default attributes when a page is freed
 * - Guarantee that mappings other than the requested one are
 *   in any state, other than that these do not violate rules for
 *   the CPU you have. Do not depend on any effects on other mappings,
 *   CPUs other than the one you have may have more relaxed rules.
 * The caller is required to take care of these.

/*
 * For legacy compatibility with the old APIs, a few functions
 * are provided that work on a "struct page".
 * These functions operate ONLY on the 1:1 kernel mapping of the
 * memory that the struct page represents, and internally just
 * call the set_memory_* function. See the description of the
 * set_memory_* function for more details on conventions.
 *
 * These APIs should be considered *deprecated* and are likely going to
 * be removed in the future.
 * The reason for this is the implicit operation on the 1:1 mapping only,
 * making this not a generally useful API.
 *
 * Specifically, many users of the old APIs had a virtual address,
 * called virt_to_page() or vmalloc_to_page() on that address to
 * get a struct page* that the old API required.
 * To convert these cases, use set_memory_*() on the original
 * virtual address, do not use these functions.
