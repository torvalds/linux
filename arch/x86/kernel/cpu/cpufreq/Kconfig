config X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ
	tristate "ACPI Processor P-States driver"
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	depends on ACPI_PROCESSOR
	help
	  This driver adds a CPUFreq driver which utilizes the ACPI
	  Processor Performance States.
	  This driver also supports Intel Enhanced Speedstep.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called acpi-cpufreq.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config ELAN_CPUFREQ
	tristate "AMD Elan SC400 and SC410"
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	depends on X86_ELAN
	---help---
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for AMD Elan SC400 and SC410
	  processors.

	  You need to specify the processor maximum speed as boot
	  parameter: elanfreq=maxspeed (in kHz) or as module
	  parameter "max_freq".

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config SC520_CPUFREQ
	tristate "AMD Elan SC520"
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	depends on X86_ELAN
	---help---
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for AMD Elan SC520 processor.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.


config X86_POWERNOW_K6
	tristate "AMD Mobile K6-2/K6-3 PowerNow!"
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	depends on X86_32

	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for mobile AMD K7 mobile processors.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_POWERNOW_K7_ACPI

	default y
	help
	  This provides access to the K8s Processor Performance States via ACPI.
	  This driver is probably required for CPUFreq to work with multi-socket and
	  SMP systems.  It is not required on at least some single-socket yet
	  multi-core systems, even if SMP is enabled.

	  It is safe to say Y here.

config X86_GX_SUSPMOD
	tristate "Cyrix MediaGX/NatSemi Geode Suspend Modulation"
	depends on X86_32 && PCI
	help
	 This add the CPUFreq driver for NatSemi Geode processors which
	 support suspend modulation.

	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	select X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_TABLE if X86_32
	depends on X86_32 || (X86_64 && ACPI_PROCESSOR)
	help
	  This is deprecated and this functionality is now merged into
	  acpi_cpufreq (X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ). Use that driver instead of
	  speedstep_centrino.
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for Enhanced SpeedStep enabled
	  mobile CPUs.  This means Intel Pentium M (Centrino) CPUs
	  or 64bit enabled Intel Xeons.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called speedstep-centrino.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO_TABLE
	bool "Built-in tables for Banias CPUs"

	  Use built-in tables for Banias CPUs if ACPI encoding
	  is not available.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_SPEEDSTEP_ICH
	tristate "Intel Speedstep on ICH-M chipsets (ioport interface)"
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	depends on X86_32
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for certain mobile Intel Pentium III
	  (Coppermine), all mobile Intel Pentium III-M (Tualatin) and all
	  mobile Intel Pentium 4 P4-M on systems which have an Intel ICH2,
	  ICH3 or ICH4 southbridge.

config X86_P4_CLOCKMOD
	tristate "Intel Pentium 4 clock modulation"
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for Intel Pentium 4 / XEON
	  processors.  When enabled it will lower CPU temperature by skipping
	  clocks.

	  This driver should be only used in exceptional
	  circumstances when very low power is needed because it causes severe
	  slowdowns and noticeable latencies.  Normally Speedstep should be used
	  instead.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called p4-clockmod.

	depends on PROC_FS
	depends on X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ || X86_POWERNOW_K7_ACPI || X86_POWERNOW_K8_ACPI
	help
	  This enables the deprecated /proc/acpi/processor/../performance
	  interface. While it is helpful for debugging, the generic,
	  cross-architecture cpufreq interfaces should be used.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config X86_SPEEDSTEP_LIB

	bool "Relaxed speedstep capability checks"
	depends on X86_32 && (X86_SPEEDSTEP_SMI || X86_SPEEDSTEP_ICH)
	help
	  Don't perform all checks for a speedstep capable system which would
	  normally be done. Some ancient or strange systems, though speedstep
	  capable, don't always indicate that they are speedstep capable. This
	  option lets the probing code bypass some of those checks if the
	  parameter "relaxed_check=1" is passed to the module.
