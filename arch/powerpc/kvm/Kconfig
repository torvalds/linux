	bool "Virtualization"
	---help---
	  Say Y here to get to see options for using your Linux host to run
	  other operating systems inside virtual machines (guests).
	  This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and
	  disabled.

	---help---
	  Support running unmodified book3s_64 guest kernels in
	  virtual machines on POWER7 and PPC970 processors that have
	  hypervisor mode available to the host.

	  If you say Y here, KVM will use the hardware virtualization
	  facilities of POWER7 (and later) processors, meaning that
	  guest operating systems will run at full hardware speed
	  using supervisor and user modes.  However, this also means
	  that KVM is not usable under PowerVM (pHyp), is only usable
	  on POWER7 (or later) processors and PPC970-family processors,
	  and cannot emulate a different processor from the host processor.

	  If unsure, say N.

	tristate "KVM support without using hypervisor mode in host"
	depends on KVM_BOOK3S_64
	select KVM_BOOK3S_PR_POSSIBLE
	---help---
	  Support running guest kernels in virtual machines on processors
	  without using hypervisor mode in the host, by running the
	  guest in user mode (problem state) and emulating all
	  privileged instructions and registers.

	  This is not as fast as using hypervisor mode, but works on
	  machines where hypervisor mode is not available or not usable,
	  and can emulate processors that are different from the host
	  processor, including emulating 32-bit processors on a 64-bit
	  host.

	  Enable support for emulating MPIC devices inside the
          host kernel, rather than relying on userspace to emulate.
          Currently, support is limited to certain versions of
          Freescale's MPIC implementation.

	  Include support for the XICS (eXternal Interrupt Controller
	  Specification) interrupt controller architecture used on
	  IBM POWER (pSeries) servers.
