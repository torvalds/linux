	bool "Virtualization"
	---help---
	  Say Y here to get to see options for using your Linux host to run
	  other operating systems inside virtual machines (guests).
	  This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and
	  disabled.

	---help---
	  Support running unmodified book3s_64 and book3s_32 guest kernels
	  in virtual machines on book3s_64 host processors.

	  This module provides access to the hardware capabilities through
	  a character device node named /dev/kvm.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  If unsure, say N.

config KVM_EXIT_TIMING
	bool "Detailed exit timing"
	depends on KVM_440 || KVM_E500
	---help---
	  Calculate elapsed time for every exit/enter cycle. A per-vcpu
	  report is available in debugfs kvm/vm#_vcpu#_timing.
	  The overhead is relatively small, however it is not recommended for
	  production environments.

	  If unsure, say N.

config KVM_E500
	bool "KVM support for PowerPC E500 processors"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && E500

	  Support running unmodified E500 guest kernels in virtual machines on
