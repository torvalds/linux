config KVM_GUEST
	bool "KVM Guest support"
	default n

	---help---
	  This option enables various optimizations for running under the KVM
	  hypervisor. Overhead for the kernel when not running inside KVM should
	  be minimal.

	  In case of doubt, say Y

config EPAPR_PARAVIRT
	bool "ePAPR para-virtualization support"

	help
	  Enables ePAPR para-virtualization support for guests.

	  In case of doubt, say Y

config PPC_NATIVE
	bool
	depends on 6xx || PPC64
	help
	  Support for running natively on the hardware, i.e. without
	  a hypervisor. This option is not user-selectable but should
	  be selected by all platforms that need it.

config PPC_OF_BOOT_TRAMPOLINE
	bool "Support booting from Open Firmware or yaboot"
	depends on 6xx || PPC64
	default y
	help
	  Support from booting from Open Firmware or yaboot using an
	  Open Firmware client interface. This enables the kernel to
	  communicate with open firmware to retrieve system information
	  such as the device tree.

	  In case of doubt, say Y

config UDBG_RTAS_CONSOLE

config PPC_SMP_MUXED_IPI
	bool
	help
	  Select this opton if your platform supports SMP and your
	  interrupt controller provides less than 4 interrupts to each
	  cpu.	This will enable the generic code to multiplex the 4
	  messages on to one ipi.

config MPIC_TIMER
	bool "MPIC Global Timer"
	depends on MPIC && FSL_SOC
	default n
	help
	  The MPIC global timer is a hardware timer inside the
	  Freescale PIC complying with OpenPIC standard. When the
	  specified interval times out, the hardware timer generates
	  an interrupt. The driver currently is only tested on fsl
	  chip, but it can potentially support other global timers
	  complying with the OpenPIC standard.

config FSL_MPIC_TIMER_WAKEUP
	tristate "Freescale MPIC global timer wakeup driver"
	depends on FSL_SOC &&  MPIC_TIMER && PM
	default n

	  The driver provides a way to wake up the system by MPIC
	  timer.

	bool

	help
	  This option enables a MPIC driver workaround for some chips
	  that have a bug that causes some interrupt source information
	  to not read back properly. It is safe to use on other chips as
	  well, but enabling it uses about 8KB of memory to keep copies
	  of the register contents in software.

config PPC601_SYNC_FIX
	bool "Workarounds for PPC601 bugs"
	depends on 6xx && PPC_PMAC
	help
	  Some versions of the PPC601 (the first PowerPC chip) have bugs which
	  mean that extra synchronization instructions are required near
	  certain instructions, typically those that make major changes to the
	  CPU state.  These extra instructions reduce performance slightly.
	  If you say N here, these extra instructions will not be included,
	  resulting in a kernel which will run faster but may not run at all
	  on some systems with the PPC601 chip.

	  If in doubt, say Y here.

config TAU
	bool "On-chip CPU temperature sensor support"
	depends on 6xx
	help
	  G3 and G4 processors have an on-chip temperature sensor called the
	  'Thermal Assist Unit (TAU)', which, in theory, can measure the on-die
	  temperature within 2-4 degrees Celsius. This option shows the current
	  on-die temperature in /proc/cpuinfo if the cpu supports it.

	  Unfortunately, on some chip revisions, this sensor is very inaccurate
	  and in many cases, does not work at all, so don't assume the cpu
	  temp is actually what /proc/cpuinfo says it is.

config TAU_INT
	bool "Interrupt driven TAU driver (DANGEROUS)"
	depends on TAU
	---help---
	  The TAU supports an interrupt driven mode which causes an interrupt
	  whenever the temperature goes out of range. This is the fastest way
	  to get notified the temp has exceeded a range. With this option off,
	  a timer is used to re-check the temperature periodically.

	  However, on some cpus it appears that the TAU interrupt hardware
	  is buggy and can cause a situation which would lead unexplained hard
	  lockups.

	  Unless you are extending the TAU driver, or enjoy kernel/hardware
	  debugging, leave this option off.

config TAU_AVERAGE
	bool "Average high and low temp"
	depends on TAU
	---help---
	  The TAU hardware can compare the temperature to an upper and lower
	  bound.  The default behavior is to show both the upper and lower
	  bound in /proc/cpuinfo. If the range is large, the temperature is
	  either changing a lot, or the TAU hardware is broken (likely on some
	  G4's). If the range is small (around 4 degrees), the temperature is
	  relatively stable.  If you say Y here, a single temperature value,
	  halfway between the upper and lower bounds, will be reported in
	  /proc/cpuinfo.

	  If in doubt, say N here.

config QE_GPIO
	bool "QE GPIO support"
	depends on QUICC_ENGINE
	select GPIOLIB
	help
	  Say Y here if you're going to use hardware that connects to the
	  QE GPIOs.

config CPM2
	bool "Enable support for the CPM2 (Communications Processor Module)"
	depends on (FSL_SOC_BOOKE && PPC32) || 8260
	select CPM
	select PPC_PCI_CHOICE
	select GPIOLIB
	help
	  The CPM2 (Communications Processor Module) is a coprocessor on
	  embedded CPUs made by Freescale.  Selecting this option means that
	  you wish to build a kernel for a machine with a CPM2 coprocessor
	  on it (826x, 827x, 8560).

config AXON_RAM
	tristate "Axon DDR2 memory device driver"
	depends on PPC_IBM_CELL_BLADE && BLOCK
	default m
	help
	  It registers one block device per Axon's DDR2 memory bank found
	  on a system. Block devices are called axonram?, their major and
	  minor numbers are available in /proc/devices, /proc/partitions or
	  in /sys/block/axonram?/dev.

config FSL_ULI1575
	bool
	default n
	select GENERIC_ISA_DMA
	help
	  Supports for the ULI1575 PCIe south bridge that exists on some
	  Freescale reference boards. The boards all use the ULI in pretty
	  much the same way.

config CPM
	bool
	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR

config OF_RTC
	bool
	help
	  Uses information from the OF or flattened device tree to instantiate
	  platform devices for direct mapped RTC chips like the DS1742 or DS1743.

config GEN_RTC
	bool "Use the platform RTC operations from user space"
	select RTC_CLASS
	select RTC_DRV_GENERIC
	help
	  This option provides backwards compatibility with the old gen_rtc.ko
	  module that was traditionally used for old PowerPC machines.
	  Platforms should migrate to enabling the RTC_DRV_GENERIC by hand
	  replacing their get_rtc_time/set_rtc_time callbacks with
	  a proper RTC device driver.

config SIMPLE_GPIO
	bool "Support for simple, memory-mapped GPIO controllers"
	depends on PPC
	select GPIOLIB
	help
	  Say Y here to support simple, memory-mapped GPIO controllers.
	  These are usually BCSRs used to control board's switches, LEDs,
	  chip-selects, Ethernet/USB PHY's power and various other small
	  on-board peripherals.

config MCU_MPC8349EMITX
	bool "MPC8349E-mITX MCU driver"
	depends on I2C=y && PPC_83xx
	select GPIOLIB
	help
	  Say Y here to enable soft power-off functionality on the Freescale
	  boards with the MPC8349E-mITX-compatible MCU chips. This driver will
	  also register MCU GPIOs with the generic GPIO API, so you'll able
	  to use MCU pins as GPIOs.

config XILINX_PCI
