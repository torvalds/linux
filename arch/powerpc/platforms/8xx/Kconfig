	  This enables a workaround for erratum CPU15 on MPC8xx chips.
	  This bug can cause incorrect code execution under certain
	  circumstances.  This workaround adds some overhead (a TLB miss
	  every time execution crosses a page boundary), and you may wish
	  to disable it if you have worked around the bug in the compiler
	  (by not placing conditional branches or branches to LR or CTR
	  in the last word of a page, with a target of the last cache
	  line in the next page), or if you have used some other
	  workaround.

	  If in doubt, say Y here.
