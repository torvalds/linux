	bool
	depends on APUS
	default y
	help
	  This option enables support for the Amiga series of computers.

config ZORRO
	bool
	depends on APUS
	default y
	help
	  This enables support for the Zorro bus in the Amiga. If you have
	  expansion cards in your Amiga that conform to the Amiga
	  AutoConfig(tm) specification, say Y, otherwise N. Note that even
	  expansion cards that do not fit in the Zorro slots but fit in e.g.
	  the CPU slot may fall in this category, so you have to say Y to let
	  Linux use these.

config AMIGA_PCMCIA
	bool "Amiga 1200/600 PCMCIA support"
	depends on APUS && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Include support in the kernel for pcmcia on Amiga 1200 and Amiga
	  600. If you intend to use pcmcia cards say Y; otherwise say N.

config AMIGA_BUILTIN_SERIAL
	tristate "Amiga builtin serial support"
	depends on APUS
	help
	  If you want to use your Amiga's built-in serial port in Linux,
	  answer Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

config GVPIOEXT

	depends on APUS
	help
	  If you want to use a GVP IO-Extender serial card in Linux, say Y.
	  Otherwise, say N.

config GVPIOEXT_LP
	tristate "GVP IO-Extender parallel printer support"
	depends on GVPIOEXT
	help
	  Say Y to enable driving a printer from the parallel port on your
	  GVP IO-Extender card, N otherwise.

config GVPIOEXT_PLIP
	tristate "GVP IO-Extender PLIP support"
	depends on GVPIOEXT
	help
	  Say Y to enable doing IP over the parallel port on your GVP
	  IO-Extender card, N otherwise.

config MULTIFACE_III_TTY
	tristate "Multiface Card III serial support"
	depends on APUS
	help
	  If you want to use a Multiface III card's serial port in Linux,
	  answer Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

config A2232
	tristate "Commodore A2232 serial support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && APUS
	---help---
	  This option supports the 2232 7-port serial card shipped with the
	  Amiga 2000 and other Zorro-bus machines, dating from 1989.  At
	  a max of 19,200 bps, the ports are served by a 6551 ACIA UART chip
	  each, plus a 8520 CIA, and a master 6502 CPU and buffer as well. The
	  ports were connected with 8 pin DIN connectors on the card bracket,
	  for which 8 pin to DB25 adapters were supplied. The card also had
	  jumpers internally to toggle various pinning configurations.

	  This driver can be built as a module; but then "generic_serial"
	  will also be built as a module. This has to be loaded before
	  "ser_a2232". If you want to do this, answer M here.

config WHIPPET_SERIAL
	tristate "Hisoft Whippet PCMCIA serial support"
	depends on AMIGA_PCMCIA
	help
	  HiSoft has a web page at <http://www.hisoft.co.uk/>, but there
	  is no listing for the Whippet in their Amiga section.

config APNE
	tristate "PCMCIA NE2000 support"
	depends on AMIGA_PCMCIA
	help
	  If you have a PCMCIA NE2000 compatible adapter, say Y.  Otherwise,
	  say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called apne.

config SERIAL_CONSOLE

config HEARTBEAT
	bool "Use power LED as a heartbeat"
	depends on APUS
	help
	  Use the power-on LED on your machine as a load meter.  The exact
	  behavior is platform-dependent, but normally the flash frequency is
	  a hyperbolic function of the 5-minute load average.
