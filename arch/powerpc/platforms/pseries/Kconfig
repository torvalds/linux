	  Select this option to enable shared memory partition support.
	  With this option a system running in an LPAR can be given more
	  memory than physically available and will allow firmware to
	  balance memory across many LPARs.

config CMM
	tristate "Collaborative memory management"
	depends on PPC_SMLPAR
	default y
	help
	  Select this option, if you want to enable the kernel interface
	  to reduce the memory size of the system. This is accomplished
	  by allocating pages of memory and put them "on hold". This only
	  makes sense for a system running in an LPAR where the unused pages
	  will be reused for other LPARs. The interface allows firmware to
	  balance memory across many LPARs.

config DTL

	help
	  SPLPAR machines can log hypervisor preempt & dispatch events to a
	  kernel buffer. Saying Y here will enable logging these events,
	  which are accessible through a debugfs file.

	  Say N if you are unsure.
