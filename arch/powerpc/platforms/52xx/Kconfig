	  This option enables support for a simple MPC52xx based boards which
	  do not need a custom platform specific setup. Such boards are
	  supported assuming the following:

	  - GPIO pins are configured by the firmware,
	  - CDM configuration (clocking) is setup correctly by firmware,
	  - if the 'fsl,has-wdt' property is present in one of the
	    gpt nodes, then it is safe to use such gpt to reset the board,
	  - PCI is supported if enabled in the kernel configuration
	    and if there is a PCI bus node defined in the device tree.

	  Boards that are compatible with this generic platform support
	  are:
	     intercontrol,digsy-mtc
	     phytec,pcm030
	     phytec,pcm032
	     promess,motionpro
