	int "PS3 Platform pagetable size"
	range 18 20
	default 20
	help
	  This option is only for experts who may have the desire to fine
	  tune the pagetable size on their system.  The value here is
	  expressed as the log2 of the page table size.  Valid values are
	  18, 19, and 20, corresponding to 256KB, 512KB and 1MB respectively.

	  If unsure, choose the default (20) with the confidence that your
	  system will have optimal runtime performance.

config PS3_DYNAMIC_DMA

	bool "PS3 Platform dynamic DMA page table management"
	default n
	help
	  This option will enable kernel support to take advantage of the
	  per device dynamic DMA page table management provided by the Cell
	  processor's IO Controller.  This support incurs some runtime
	  overhead and also slightly increases kernel memory usage.  The
	  current implementation should be considered experimental.

	  This support is mainly for Linux kernel development.  If unsure,
	  say N.
