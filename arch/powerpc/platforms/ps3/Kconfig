	  This option enables support for the Sony PS3 game console
	  and other platforms using the PS3 hypervisor.
	  Support for this platform is not yet complete, so
	  enabling this will not result in a bootable kernel on a
	  PS3 system.

config PS3_ADVANCED
	depends on PPC_PS3
	bool "PS3 Advanced configuration options"
	help
	  This gives you access to some advanced options for the PS3. The
	  defaults should be fine for most users, but these options may make
	  it possible to better control the kernel configuration if you know
	  what you are doing.

	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about these options.

	  Most users should say N to this question.

config PS3_HTAB_SIZE
	depends on PPC_PS3
	int "PS3 Platform pagetable size" if PS3_ADVANCED
	range 18 20
	default 20
	help
	  This option is only for experts who may have the desire to fine
	  tune the pagetable size on their system.  The value here is
	  expressed as the log2 of the page table size.  Valid values are
	  18, 19, and 20, corresponding to 256KB, 512KB and 1MB respectively.

	  If unsure, choose the default (20) with the confidence that your
	  system will have optimal runtime performance.

config PS3_DYNAMIC_DMA
	depends on PPC_PS3 && EXPERIMENTAL
	bool "PS3 Platform dynamic DMA page table management"
	default n
	help
	  This option will enable kernel support to take advantage of the
	  per device dynamic DMA page table management provided by the Cell
	  processor's IO Controller.  This support incurs some runtime
	  overhead and also slightly increases kernel memory usage.  The
	  current implementation should be considered experimental.

	  This support is mainly for Linux kernel development.  If unsure,
	  say N.

config PS3_USE_LPAR_ADDR
	depends on PPC_PS3 && EXPERIMENTAL
	bool "PS3 use lpar address space"
	default y
	help
	  This option is solely for experimentation by experts.  Disables
	  translation of lpar addresses.  SPE support currently won't work
	  without this set to y.

	  If you have any doubt, choose the default y.

	  Include support for the PS3 AV Settings driver.

	  This support is required for graphics and sound. In
	  general, all users will say Y or M.

	  This support is required for system control.  In
	  general, all users will say Y or M.
