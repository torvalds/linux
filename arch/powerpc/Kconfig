	  Select this option to enable more accurate task and CPU time
	  accounting.  This is done by reading a CPU counter on each
	  kernel entry and exit and on transitions within the kernel
	  between system, softirq and hardirq state, so there is a
	  small performance impact.  This also enables accounting of
	  stolen time on logically-partitioned systems running on
	  IBM POWER5-based machines.

	  If in doubt, say Y here.

config SMP
	depends on PPC_STD_MMU
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, say N. If you have a system with more
	  than one CPU, say Y.  Note that the kernel does not currently
	  support SMP machines with 603/603e/603ev or PPC750 ("G3") processors
	  since they have inadequate hardware support for multiprocessor
	  operation.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on single-processor machines.
	  On a single-processor machine, the kernel will run faster if you say
	  N here.

	  This doesn't add pressure to the IOMMU allocator. However, some

config KEXEC

	help
	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
	  but it is independent of the system firmware.   And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you.  It may help to enable device hotplugging
	  support.  As of this writing the exact hardware interface is
	  strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be made.

config CRASH_DUMP
	bool "Build a kdump crash kernel (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PPC_MULTIPLATFORM && PPC64 && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Build a kernel suitable for use as a kdump capture kernel.
	  The kernel will be linked at a different address than normal, and
	  so can only be used for Kdump.

	  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.

	  This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications

	  execution. By using pipes or other transports made available to
	  the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write
	  syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in
	  their own address space using seccomp. Once seccomp is
	  enabled via /proc/<pid>/seccomp, it cannot be disabled
	  and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls
	  defined by each seccomp mode.

config DEVICE_TREE

	  This specifies the device tree source (.dts) file to be

	  For example, this is required when building a cuImage target
	  for an older U-Boot, which cannot pass a device tree itself.
	  Such a kernel will not work with a newer U-Boot that tries to

	  Kprobes allows you to trap at almost any kernel address and
	  execute a callback function.  register_kprobe() establishes
	  a probepoint and specifies the callback.  Kprobes is useful
	  for kernel debugging, non-intrusive instrumentation and testing.
	  If in doubt, say "N".
