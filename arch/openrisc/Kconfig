config DCACHE_WRITETHROUGH
	bool "Have write through data caches"
	default n
	help
	  Select this if your implementation features write through data caches.
	  Selecting 'N' here will allow the kernel to force flushing of data
	  caches at relevant times. Most OpenRISC implementations support write-
	  through data caches.

	  If unsure say N here

	  Select this if your implementation has a hardware divide instruction

config OPENRISC_HAVE_INST_CMOV
	bool "Have instruction l.cmov for conditional move"
	default n
	help
	  This config enables gcc to generate l.cmov instructions when compiling
	  the kernel which in general will improve performance and reduce the
	  binary size.

	  Select this if your implementation has support for the Class II
	  l.cmov conistional move instruction.

	  Say N if you are unsure.

config OPENRISC_HAVE_INST_ROR
	bool "Have instruction l.ror for rotate right"
	default n
	help
	  This config enables gcc to generate l.ror instructions when compiling

	  binary size.

	  Select this if your implementation has support for the Class II
	  l.ror rotate right instruction.

	  Say N if you are unsure.

config OPENRISC_HAVE_INST_RORI
	bool "Have instruction l.rori for rotate right with immediate"
	default n
	help
	  This config enables gcc to generate l.rori instructions when compiling
	  the kernel which in general will improve performance and reduce the
	  binary size.

	  Select this if your implementation has support for the Class II
	  l.rori rotate right with immediate instruction.

	  Say N if you are unsure.

config OPENRISC_HAVE_INST_SEXT
	bool "Have instructions l.ext* for sign extension"
	default n

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric Multi-Processing support"
	help
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, say N. If you have a system with more
	  than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

config OPENRISC_NO_SPR_SR_DSX
	bool "use SPR_SR_DSX software emulation" if OR1K_1200
	default y
	help
	  SPR_SR_DSX bit is status register bit indicating whether
	  the last exception has happened in delay slot.

	  OpenRISC architecture makes it optional to have it implemented
	  in hardware and the OR1200 does not have it.

	  Say N here if you know that your OpenRISC processor has
	  SPR_SR_DSX bit implemented. Say Y if you are unsure.

config OPENRISC_HAVE_SHADOW_GPRS
	bool "Support for shadow gpr files" if !SMP
	default y if SMP
	help
	  Say Y here if your OpenRISC processor features shadowed
	  register files. They will in such case be used as a
	  scratch reg storage on exception entry.

	  On SMP systems, this feature is mandatory.
	  On a unicore system it's safe to say N here if you are unsure.

config CMDLINE
	string "Default kernel command string"
	default ""
	help
	  On some architectures there is currently no way for the boot loader
	  to pass arguments to the kernel. For these architectures, you should
	  supply some command-line options at build time by entering them
	  here.

menu "Debugging options"

config JUMP_UPON_UNHANDLED_EXCEPTION
	bool "Try to die gracefully"
	default y
	help
	  Now this puts kernel into infinite loop after first oops. Till
	  your kernel crashes this doesn't have any influence.

	  Say Y if you are unsure.

config OPENRISC_ESR_EXCEPTION_BUG_CHECK
	bool "Check for possible ESR exception bug"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables some checks that might expose some problems
	  in kernel.

	  Say N if you are unsure.
