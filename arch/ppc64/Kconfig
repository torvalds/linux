	  Enabling this option will make the kernel run more efficiently

	  two or more partitions.

config KEXEC
	bool "kexec system call (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PPC_MULTIPLATFORM && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
	  but it is indepedent of the system firmware.  And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similiarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you.  It may help to enable device hotplugging
	  support.  As of this writing the exact hardware interface is
	  strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be made.

config POWER4_ONLY
	bool "Optimize for POWER4"
	default n
	---help---
	  Cause the compiler to optimize for POWER4 processors. The resulting
	  binary will not work on POWER3 or RS64 processors when compiled with
	  binutils 2.15 or later.

config IOMMU_VMERGE
	bool "Enable IOMMU virtual merging (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	help
	  Cause IO segments sent to a device for DMA to be merged virtually
	  by the IOMMU when they happen to have been allocated contiguously.
	  This doesn't add pressure to the IOMMU allocator. However, some
	  drivers don't support getting large merged segments coming back
	  from *_map_sg(). Say Y if you know the drivers you are using are
	  properly handling this case.

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, say N. If you have a system with more
	  than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on single-processor machines.
	  On a single-processor machine, the kernel will run faster if you say
	  N here.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say Y.

config NR_CPUS

config NODES_SPAN_OTHER_NODES
	def_bool y

config PPC_64K_PAGES
	bool "64k page size"
	help
	  This option changes the kernel logical page size to 64k. On machines
          without processor support for 64k pages, the kernel will simulate
          them by loading each individual 4k page on demand transparently,
          while on hardware with such support, it will be used to map
          normal application pages.

config SCHED_SMT
	bool "SMT (Hyperthreading) scheduler support"
	depends on SMP
	default off
	help
	  SMT scheduler support improves the CPU scheduler's decision making
	  when dealing with POWER5 cpus at a cost of slightly increased
	  overhead in some places. If unsure say N here.

config SECCOMP
	bool "Enable seccomp to safely compute untrusted bytecode"
	depends on PROC_FS
	default y
	help
	  This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications
	  that may need to compute untrusted bytecode during their
	  execution. By using pipes or other transports made available to
	  the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write
	  syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in
	  their own address space using seccomp. Once seccomp is
	  enabled via /proc/<pid>/seccomp, it cannot be disabled
	  and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls
	  defined by each seccomp mode.

	  If unsure, say Y. Only embedded should say N here.

config HOTPLUG_CPU
	bool "Support for hot-pluggable CPUs"

	  Say Y here to be able to turn CPUs off and on.

	  Say N if you are unsure.

config PROC_DEVICETREE
	bool "Support for Open Firmware device tree in /proc"
	help
	  This option adds a device-tree directory under /proc which contains
	  an image of the device tree that the kernel copies from Open
	  Firmware. If unsure, say Y here.

config CMDLINE_BOOL

	depends on !PPC_ISERIES

config CMDLINE
	string "Initial kernel command string"
	depends on CMDLINE_BOOL
	default "console=ttyS0,9600 console=tty0 root=/dev/sda2"
	help
	  On some platforms, there is currently no way for the boot loader to
	  pass arguments to the kernel. For these platforms, you can supply
	  some command-line options at build time by entering them here.  In
	  most cases you will need to specify the root device here.

	help
	  Find out whether you have ISA slots on your motherboard.  ISA is the
	  name of a bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff
	  inside your box.  If you have an Apple machine, say N here; if you
	  have an IBM RS/6000 or pSeries machine or a PReP machine, say Y.  If
	  you have an embedded board, consult your board documentation.

	  Find out whether your system includes a PCI bus. PCI is the name of
	  a bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
	  your box.  If you say Y here, the kernel will include drivers and
	  infrastructure code to support PCI bus devices.
