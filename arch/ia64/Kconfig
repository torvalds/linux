	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  systems, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor system.  If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  single processor systems.  On a single processor system, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  See also the SMP-HOWTO available at

	  You should set this to the number of CPUs in your system, but
	  keep in mind that a kernel compiled for, e.g., 2 CPUs will boot but
	  only use 2 CPUs on a >2 CPU system.  Setting this to a value larger
	  than 64 will cause the use of a CPU mask array, causing a small

	  Layer) information in /proc/pal.  This contains useful information
	  about the processors in your systems, such as cache and TLB sizes
	  and the PAL firmware version in use.

	  To use this option, you have to ensure that the "/proc file system
	  support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) is enabled, too.

config IA64_MC_ERR_INJECT

	help
	  Adds support for MC error injection. If enabled, the kernel

	  This driver installs a global ACPI Operation Region handler for

	  native firmware functions.  The driver installs the OpRegion
	  handler if there is an HPQ5001 device or if the user supplies
	  the "force" module parameter, e.g., with the "aml_nfw.force"
	  kernel command line option.

config KEXEC

	help
	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
	  but it is independent of the system firmware.   And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you.  As of this writing the exact hardware
	  interface is strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be
	  made.

config CRASH_DUMP
	  bool "kernel crash dumps"
