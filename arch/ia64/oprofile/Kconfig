	help
	  OProfile is a profiling system capable of profiling the
	  whole system, include the kernel, kernel modules, libraries,
	  and applications.

	  Due to firmware bugs, you may need to use the "nohalt" boot
	  option if you're using OProfile with the hardware performance
	  counters.

	  If unsure, say N.
