	default y
	---help---
	  Say Y here to get to see options for using your Linux host to run other
	  operating systems inside virtual machines (guests).
	  This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled.

	---help---
	  Support hosting fully virtualized guest machines using hardware
	  virtualization extensions.  You will need a fairly recent
	  processor equipped with virtualization extensions. You will also
	  need to select one or more of the processor modules below.

	  This module provides access to the hardware capabilities through
	  a character device node named /dev/kvm.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called kvm.

	  If unsure, say N.

config KVM_INTEL
	tristate "KVM for Intel Itanium 2 processors support"
	depends on KVM && m
	---help---
	  Provides support for KVM on Itanium 2 processors equipped with the VT
	  extensions.

config KVM_DEVICE_ASSIGNMENT
	bool "KVM legacy PCI device assignment support"
	depends on KVM && PCI && IOMMU_API
	default y
	---help---
	  Provide support for legacy PCI device assignment through KVM.  The
	  kernel now also supports a full featured userspace device driver
	  framework through VFIO, which supersedes much of this support.

	  If unsure, say Y.
