.Nm cribbage
.Op Fl emqr
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
plays the card game cribbage, with the program playing one hand
and the user the other.
The program will initially ask the user if the rules of the game
are needed \(en if so, it will print out the appropriate section from
.Em According to Hoyle .
.Pp
.Nm
options include:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl e
When players make a mistake scoring their hand or crib, provide an
explanation of the correct score.
.Po
This is especially useful for beginning players.
.Pc
.It Fl m
.Dq Muggins
\(en if a player mistakenly scores less than is due,
the opponent may claim the overlooked points.
.Pq Of course, the computer never miscalculates!
.It Fl q
Print a shorter form of all messages \(en this is only recommended for
users who have played the game without specifying this option.
.It Fl r
Instead of asking players to cut the deck, the program will randomly
cut the deck.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
first asks whether to play a short game
.Po
.Dq once around ,
to 61
.Pc
or a long game
.Po
.Dq twice around ,
to 121
.Pc .
A response of
.Sq Ic s
or
.Sq Ic S
will result in a short game; any other response will
play a long game.
.Pp
At the start of the first game, the program
asks the player to cut the deck to determine who gets the
first crib.
The user should respond with a number between 4 and
48, indicating how many cards down the deck is to be cut.
The player who cuts the lower ranked card gets the first crib.
If more than one game is played, the
loser of the previous game gets the first crib in the current game.
.Pp
For each hand, the program first prints the player's hand and
whose crib it is, and then asks the player
to discard two cards into the crib.
The cards are prompted for one per line, and are entered as explained below.
.Pp
After discarding, the program cuts the deck
.Pq if it is the player's crib
or asks the player to cut the deck
.Pq if it's its crib ;
in the latter
case, the appropriate response is a number from 4 to 36 indicating
how far down the remaining 40 cards are to be cut.
.Pp
After the deck is cut, play starts with the non-dealer
.Pq the person who doesn't have the crib
leading the first card.
Play continues until all cards are exhausted.
The program keeps track of the scoring of all points and the total of
the cards on the table.
.Pp
After play, the hands are scored.
The program requests players to score their hand
.Pq and the crib, if it is theirs
by printing out the appropriate cards.
Play continues until one player reaches the game limit
.Pq 61 or 121 .
.Pp
A carriage return when a numeric input is expected is equivalent
to typing the lowest legal value; when cutting the deck this
is equivalent to cutting after the fourth card.
.Pp
Cards are specified as rank followed by suit,
with letters case insensitive.
The ranks may be specified as one of:
.Sq a ,
.Sq 2 ,
.Sq 3 ,
.Sq 4 ,
.Sq 5 ,
.Sq 6 ,
.Sq 7 ,
.Sq 8 ,
.Sq 9 ,
.Sq t ,
.Sq j ,
.Sq q ,
and
.Sq k ,
or alternatively, one of:
.Sq ace ,
.Sq two ,
.Sq three ,
.Sq four ,
.Sq five ,
.Sq six ,
.Sq seven ,
.Sq eight ,
.Sq nine ,
.Sq ten ,
.Sq jack ,
.Sq queen ,
and
.Sq king .
Suits may be specified as:
.Sq s ,
.Sq h ,
.Sq d ,
and
.Sq c ,
or alternatively as:
.Sq spades ,
.Sq hearts ,
.Sq diamonds ,
and
.Sq clubs .
A card may be specified as:
.Dq Ar rank suit ,
or:
.Dq Ar rank No of Ar suit .
If the single letter rank and suit designations are used, the space
separating the suit and rank may be left out.
Also, if only one card of the desired rank is playable,
typing the rank is sufficient.
For example, if your hand was
.Dq 2H, 4D, 5C, 6H, JC, and KD
and it was desired to discard the king of diamonds, any of
the following could be typed:
.Sq k ,
.Sq king ,
.Sq kd ,
.Sq k d ,
.Sq k of d ,
.Sq king d ,
.Sq king of d ,
.Sq k diamonds ,
.Sq k of diamonds ,
.Sq king diamonds ,
.Sq king of diamonds .
