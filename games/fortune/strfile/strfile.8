.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm strfile ,
.Nm unstr
.Nd create a random access file for storing strings
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm strfile
.Op Fl iorsx
.Op Fl c Ar char
.Ar source_file
.Op Ar output_file
.Nm unstr
.Ar source_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads a file containing groups of lines separated by a line containing
a single percent
.Ql \&%
sign and creates a data file which contains
a header structure and a table of file offsets for each group of lines.
This allows random access of the strings.
.Pp
The output file, if not specified on the command line, is named
.Ar source_file Ns Sy .dat .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-c char"
.It Fl c Ar char
Change the delimiting character from the percent sign to
.Ar char .
.It Fl i
Ignore case when ordering the strings.
.It Fl o
Order the strings in alphabetical order.
The offset table will be sorted in the alphabetical order of the
groups of lines referenced.
Any initial non-alphanumeric characters are ignored.
This option causes the
.Dv STR_ORDERED
bit in the header
.Ar str_flags
field to be set.
.It Fl r
Randomize access to the strings.
Entries in the offset table will be randomly ordered.
This option causes the
.Dv STR_RANDOM
bit in the header
.Ar str_flags
field to be set.
.It Fl s
Run silently; don't give a summary message when finished.
.It Fl x
Note that each alphabetic character in the groups of lines is rotated
13 positions in a simple caesar cypher.
This option causes the
.Dv STR_ROTATED
bit in the header
.Ar str_flags
field to be set.
.El
.Pp
The format of the header is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#define	VERSION		2
	u_int32_t	str_version;		/* version number */
	u_int32_t	str_numstr;		/* # of strings in the file */
	u_int32_t	str_longlen;		/* length of longest string */
	u_int32_t	str_shortlen;		/* length of shortest string */
#define	STR_RANDOM	0x1			/* randomized pointers */
#define	STR_ORDERED	0x2			/* ordered pointers */
#define	STR_ROTATED	0x4			/* rot-13'd text */
	u_int32_t	str_flags;		/* bit field for flags */
	u_int8_t	stuff[4];		/* long aligned space */
#define	str_delim	stuff[0]		/* delimiting character */
.Ed
.Pp
All fields are written in network byte order.
Each field is also written independently so as to avoid structure padding
problems on some architectures.
.Pp
The purpose of
.Nm unstr
is to undo the work of
.Nm strfile .
It prints out the strings contained in the file
.Ar source_file
in the order that they are listed in
the header file
.Ar source_file Ns Sy .dat
to standard output.
It is possible to create sorted versions of input files by using
.Fl o
when
.Nm strfile
is run and then using
.Nm unstr
to dump them out in the table order.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width source_file.dat -compact
.It Ar source_file Ns Sy .dat

.Nm strfile
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
