.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program allows you to play the familiar Battleships game against the
computer on a 10x10 board.
The interface is visual and largely self-explanatory;
you place your ships and pick your shots by moving the cursor around the
.Sq sea
with the
.Xr hack 6
motion keys
.Em hjklyubn .
.Pp
Note that when selecting a ship to place, you must type the capital letter
(these are, after all, capital ships).
During ship placement, the
.Sq r
command may be used to ignore the current position and randomly place your
currently selected ship.
The
.Sq R
command will place all remaining ships randomly.
The ^L command
.Pq form feed, ASCII 12
will force a screen redraw.
.Pp
The command-line arguments control game modes:
.Bl -tag -width XxXXX
.It Fl b
Selects a
.Sq blitz
variant.
This allows a side to shoot for as long as it continues to score hits.
.It Fl c
Permits ships to be placed adjacently.
Normally, ships must be separated by at least one square of open water.
This disables that check and allows them to close-pack.
.It Fl s
Selects a
.Sq salvo
variant.
This allows players one shot per turn for each of their
ships still afloat.
This puts a premium on scoring hits early and knocking out
some ships and also makes it much harder, for example, when you face a superior
force with only your PT-boat.

.Sh NOTES
The algorithm the computer uses once it has found a ship to sink is provably
optimal.
The dispersion criterion for the random-fire algorithm may not be.
