.Sh NAME
.Nm rain
.Nd animated raindrops display
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rain
.Op Fl d Ar delay
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is modeled after the VAX/VMS program of the same name.
.Pp
To obtain the proper effect, the
.Fl d
option may be used to specify a delay in milliseconds between each update.
Reasonable values are around 20\(en200.
The default is based on the terminal speed, computed via the following formula:
.Pp
.Dl delay = speed / 9600 \- 1
.Pp
As with any
.Xr curses 3
program, the
.Ev TERM
environment variable must be set (and exported) to the type of the
terminal being used.
