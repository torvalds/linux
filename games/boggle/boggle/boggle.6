.Sh DESCRIPTION
The object of
.Nm
is to find as many words as possible on the Boggle board within the three
minute time limit.
A Boggle board is a four by four arrangement of Boggle cubes, each side of
each cube displaying a letter of the alphabet or
.Sq qu .
Words are formed by finding a sequence of cubes (letters) that are in the
game's dictionary.
The (N+1)th cube in the word must be horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally adjacent to the Nth cube.
Cubes cannot be reused.
Words consist solely of lower case letters and must be at least 3 letters long.
.Pp
Command line flags can be given to change the rules of the game:
.Bl -tag -width boardspec
.It Fl B
Use an alternate five by five arrangement of Boggle cubes.
In this mode the default minimum word length is 4 letters.
This arrangement has been marketed over the years under the names
.Em Big Boggle ,
.Em Super Boggle
and
.Em Boggle Deluxe .
.It Fl b
Run
.Nm
in batch mode.
A
.Ar boardspec
must also be given.
The dictionary is read from stdin and a list of words appearing in
.Ar boardspec
is printed to stdout.
.It Fl c
Add a so-called
.Em challenge cube
to the board, which contains less commonly used letters.
The challenge cube will be displayed in boldface on the board.
Depending on the terminal capabilities, it may be displayed in
underline or a different color (such as red).
.It Fl d
Enable debugging output.
.It Fl t Ar time
Change the time limit for each game from the default 3 minutes to
.Ar time
seconds.
.It Fl w Ar length
Change the minimum word length from 3 letters to
.Ar length .
.It Cm +
Allow a cube to be used multiple times, but not in succession.
.It Cm ++
Allow a cube to be considered adjacent to itself.
.El
.Pp
A starting board position,
.Ar boardspec ,
can be specified on the command line by
listing the board left to right and top to bottom, in lower case.
