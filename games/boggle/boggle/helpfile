(^u means "control u", etc.)

Any time you are prompted while the board is displayed you can type:
                           <esc>word
to see where "word" is on the board.

Usage:
    boggle [-Bbcd] [-t time] [-w length] [+[+]] [boardspec]

    -B: big boggle mode, uses a 5x5 board
    -b: batch mode (boardspec must be present); dictionary read from stdin
    -c: a challenge cube will be added to the board
    -d: debug mode
    -t time: time limit in seconds instead of default 180
    -w length: minimum word length in letters instead of default 3
    +: can reuse a cube, but not twice in succession
    ++: can reuse cubes arbitrarily
    boardspec: the first board to use (use 'q' for 'qu'); e.g.:
          boggle nolezeebnqieegei

                            Default Rules

A Boggle board is a four by four arrangement of Boggle cubes.
You have 3 minutes to find as many words as possible in the Boggle board.
Words are formed by finding a sequence of cubes (letters) that are in the
game's dictionary.  The (N+1)th cube in the word must be horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally adjacent to the Nth cube.  Cubes cannot be reused.
Words consist solely of lower case letters and must be at least 3 letters long.
.
                           Options

Command line flags can be given to change the rules of the game.
The '+' flag allows a cube to be used multiple times, but not in succession.
The '++' flag makes each cube adjacent to itself.
The time limit can be changed from the default 3 minutes by using the
flag '-t time' where 'time' is the duration (in seconds) of each game.
The minimum word length can be changed from 3 letters by specifying
'-w length' where 'length' is the minimum number of letters to use.
