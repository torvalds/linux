.Sh NAME
.Nm monop
.Nd Monopoly game
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm monop
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is reminiscent of the Parker Brother's game Monopoly, and
monitors a game between 2 to 9 users.
It is assumed that the rules of Monopoly are known.
The game follows the standard rules, with the exception that,
if a property goes up for auction and there are only two solvent players,
no auction is held and the property remains unowned.
.Pp
The game, in effect, lends the player money,
so it is possible to buy something which you cannot afford.
However, as soon as players go into debt,
they must
.Dq fix the problem ,
i.e., make themselves solvent, before play can continue.
If this is not possible, the player's property reverts to their debtee,
either a player or the bank.
A player can resign at any time to any person or the bank,
which puts the property back on the board, unowned.
.Pp
Any time that the response to a question is a
.Em string ,
e.g., a name, place or person, you can type
.Sq Ic \&?
to get a list of valid answers.
It is not possible to input a negative number, nor is it ever necessary.

If there is more than one, it asks you which you want to buy for.
It then asks you how many for each piece of property,
giving the current amount in parentheses after the property name.
If you build in an unbalanced manner
(a disparity of more than one house within the same monopoly),
it asks you to re-input.

If you resign to the bank, all property reverts to its virgin state,
and get-out-of-jail-free cards revert to the deck.

You can continue play after saving,
either by adding the file in which you saved the game after the

and, if the file exists, confirm that you wish to overwrite it.
