.Sh NAME
.Nm worms
.Nd animate worms on a display terminal
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm worms
.Op Fl ft
.Op Fl d Ar delay
.Op Fl l Ar length
.Op Fl n Ar number
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A
.Ux
version of the DEC-2136 program
.Dq worms .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-l length"
.It Fl d Ar delay
Specifies a delay, in milliseconds, between each update.
This is useful for fast terminals.
Reasonable values are around 20\(en200.
The default is based on the terminal speed.
If the terminal is 9600 baud or slower, no delay is used.
Otherwise, the delay is computed via the following formula:
.Pp
.Dl delay = speed / 9600 \- 1
.It Fl f
Makes a
.Dq field
for the worm(s) to eat.
.It Fl l Ar length
Specifies a length for each worm; the default is 16.
.It Fl n Ar number
Specifies the number of worms; the default is 3.
.It Fl t
Makes each worm leave a trail behind it.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The lower-right-hand character position will not be updated properly
on a terminal that wraps at the right margin.
