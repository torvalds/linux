except at the end of a move.
The program is mostly self-explanatory:
a question mark (?) will usually get some help.
If you answer
.Sq y
when the program asks if you want the rules,
you will get text explaining the rules of the game,
some hints on strategy,
instructions on how to use the program,
and a tutorial consisting of a practice game against the computer.
