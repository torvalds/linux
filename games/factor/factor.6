.Dt FACTOR 6
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm factor ,
.Nm primes
.Nd factor a number, generate primes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm factor
.Op Ar number ...
.Nm primes
.Op Ar start Op Ar stop
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility will factor 64-bit positive integers.
When a number is factored, it is printed, followed by a
.Sq \&: ,
and the list of its prime factors in ascending order, on a single line.
Every prime factor is printed as often as it divides the number.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is invoked with one or more arguments,
each argument will be factored.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is invoked with no arguments,
.Nm
reads numbers, one per line, from standard input, until end of file or error.
White-space and empty lines are ignored.
Numbers may be preceded by a single +.
After a number is read, it is factored.
Input lines must not be longer than 99 characters.
.Pp
The
.Nm primes
utility prints primes in ascending order, one per line, starting at or above
.Ar start
and continuing until, but not including
.Ar stop .
The
.Ar start
value must be at least 0 and not greater than
.Ar stop .
The
.Ar stop
value must not be greater than 4294967295.
The default value of
.Ar stop
is 4294967295.
.Pp
When the
.Nm primes
utility is invoked with no arguments,
.Ar start
is read from standard input.
.Ar stop
is taken to be 4294967295.
The
.Ar start
value may be preceded by a single +.
The input line must not be longer than 99 characters.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm factor
cannot handle the
.Dq 10 most wanted
factor list;
.Nm primes
won't get you a world record.
