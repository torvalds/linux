.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm

If the message is omitted, it prompts for and
reads one line of its standard input.
If
.Fl w
is given, the output is scrunched down from a width of 132 to
.Ar width ,
suitable for a narrow terminal.
.Pp
The output should be printed on a hard-copy device, up to 132 columns wide,
with no breaks between the pages.

.Sh BUGS
Several ASCII characters are not defined, notably <, >, [, ], \e,
^, _, {, }, |, and ~.
Also, the characters ", ', and & are funny
looking
.Pq but in a useful way .
.Pp
The
.Fl w
option is implemented by skipping some rows and columns.
The smaller it gets, the grainier the output.
Sometimes it runs letters together.
