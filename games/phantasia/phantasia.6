.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
.Nm
is currently unusable because it relies on
.Xr setgid 2
to allow multiple users read and write access to the same files.
.Ef
.Pp
.Nm
is a role-playing game that allows players to roll up characters of
various types to fight monsters and other players.
Progression of characters is based upon gaining experience from fighting
monsters (and other players).
.Pp
Most of the game is menu-driven and self-explanatory (more or less).
.\" The screen is cursor updated, so be sure to set up the
.\" .Ev TERM
.\" variable in your environment.
.Pp
The options provide for a variety of functions to support the game.
They are:
.Bl -tag -width aaa -offset indent
.It Fl a
Get a listing of all character names on file.
.It Fl b
Show scoreboard of top characters per login.
.It Fl H
Print header only.
.It Fl m
Get a monster listing.
.It Fl p
Purge old characters.
.It Fl S
Turn on wizard options, if allowed, if running as
.Em root .
.It Fl s
Invoke
.Nm
without header information.
.It Fl x
Examine/change a particular character on file.
.El
.Pp
The characters are saved on a common file, in order to make the game
interactive between players.
Each character is given a password which allows later retrieval.
Only characters above
.Em level
zero are saved.
Characters unused for a while will be purged.
Characters are only placed on the scoreboard when they die.
.Sh PARTICULARS
.Ss Normal Play
A number of the player's more important statistics are almost always
displayed on the screen, with maximums (where applicable) in
parentheses.
.Pp
The character is placed randomly near the center of a Cartesian
system.
Most commands are selected with a single letter or digit.
For example, one may move by hitting
.Sq W ,
.Sq S ,
.Sq N ,
or
.Sq E ,
(lower case may also be used; at no time is the game case-dependent).
One may also use
.Sq H ,
.Sq J ,
.Sq K ,
and
.Sq L
for movement, as with
.Xr vi 1 .
The
.Ic move
.Pq Sq 1
command is for moving to a specific (x, y) coordinate.
The distance a character can move is calculated by
1 plus 1.5 per
.Em level .
Moving in a compass direction will move the player the maximum
allowed distance in that direction.
.Pp
A player may see who else is playing by using the
.Ic players
.Pq Sq 2
option.
One may see the coordinates of those who are the same
distance or closer to the origin as the player.
.Em Kings
and
.Em council of the wise
can see and can be seen by everyone.
A
.Em palantir
removes these restrictions.
.Pp
One can talk to other players with the
.Ic talk
.Pq Sq 3
option.
In general, this is a line or so of text.
To remove the current message, just type
.Aq return
when prompted for a message.
.Pp
The
.Ic stats
.Pq Sq 4
option shows additional characteristics of a player.
.Pp
One may leave the game with the
.Ic quit
.Pq Sq 5
option.
.Pp
One may rest by default.
Resting lets one regain maximum
.Em energy level ,
and also lets one find
.Em mana .
More mana is found at larger levels and further distances from the origin.
.Pp
One may call a monster by hitting
.Sq 9
or
.Sq C .
.Pp
.Sq X
can be used to examine other players.
.Pp
One may quit or execute a sub-shell by hitting interrupt.
Quitting during battle results in death, for obvious reasons.
.Pp
Several other options become available as the player progresses in
.Em level
and
.Em magic ,
or to other stations in the game
.Em ( valar ,
.Em council of the wise ,
.Em king ) .
These are described elsewhere.
In general, a control-L will force the redrawing of the screen.
.Pp
Other things which may happen are more or less self-explanatory.
.Ss Fighting Monsters
A player has several options while fighting monsters.
They are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width skirmish -offset indent
.It Ic melee
Inflicts damage on the monster, based upon
.Em strength .
Also decreases the monster's
.Em strength
some.
.It Ic skirmish
Inflicts a little less damage than
.Ic melee ,
but decreases the monster's
.Em quickness
instead.
.It Ic evade
Attempt to run away.
Success is based upon both the player's and the monster's
.Em brains
and
.Em quickness .
.It Ic spell
Several options for throwing spells (described elsewhere).
.It Ic nick
Hits the monster one plus the player's
.Em sword ,
and gives the player 10% of the monster's
.Em experience .
Decreases the monster's
.Em experience
an amount proportional to the amount granted.
This also increases the monster's quickness.
Paralyzed monsters wake up very fast when nicked.
.It Ic luckout
This is essentially a battle of wits with the monster.
Success is based upon the player's and the monster's
.Em brains .
If successful, the player gets credit for slaying the monster.
Otherwise, nothing happens, and the chance to
.Ic luckout
is lost.
.El
.Ss Character Statistics
.Bl -tag -width energyXlevel -offset indent
.It Em strength
determines how much damage a character can inflict.
.It Em quickness
determines how many chances a character gets to make decisions while fighting.
.It Em energy level
specifies how much damage a character may endure before dying.
.It Em magic level
determines which spells a character may throw, and how effective those
spells will be.
.It Em brains
basically, the character's intelligence; used for various fighting options
and spells.
.It Em mana
used as a power source for throwing spells.
.It Em experience
gained by fighting monsters and other characters.
.It Em level
indicative of how much experience a character has accumulated; progresses
geometrically as
.Em experience
increases.
.It Em poison
sickness which degrades a character's performance (affects
.Em energy level
and
.Em strength ) .
.It Em sin
accumulated as a character does certain nasty things; used only rarely
in normal play of the game.
.It Em age
of player; roughly equivalent to number of turns.
As
.Em age
increases, many personal statistics degenerate.
.El
.Ss Character Types
Character statistics are rolled randomly from the above list, according
to character type.
The types are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "experimento" -offset indent
.It Em magic user
strong in
.Em magic level
and
.Em brains ,
weak in other areas.
Must rely on wits and magic to survive.
.It Em fighter
good in
.Em strength
and
.Em energy level ,
fairly good in other areas.
This adds up to a well-equipped fighter.
.It Em elf
very high
.Em quickness
and above average
.Em magic level .
.It Em dwarf
very high
.Em strength
and
.Em energy level ,
but with a tendency to be rather slow and not too bright.
.It Em halfling
rather quick and smart, with high
.Em energy level ,
but poor in
.Em magic
and
.Em strength .
Born with some
.Em experience .
.It Em experimento
very mediocre in all areas.
However, the
.Em experimento
may be placed almost anywhere within the playing grid.

The character type also determines how much gold a player may
carry, how long until

the player can withstand.

.Ss Monsters
Monsters get bigger farther from the origin (0,0).
Rings of distance 125 from the origin determine the size.
A monster's
.Em experience ,
.Em energy level ,
and
.Em brains
are multiplied by the size.
.Em Strength
is increased 50% per size over one, and
.Em quickness
remains the same, regardless of size.
.Pp
Nastier monsters are found as one progresses farther out from the origin.
Monsters also may flock.
The percent chance of that happening is designated as
.Em flock%
in the monster listing.
Monsters outside the first ring
may carry treasure, as determined by their treasure type.
Flocking monsters, and bigger monsters, increase the chances of treasure.
.Pp
Certain monsters have special abilities, as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "Assorted Faeries"
.It Em Unicorn
can only be subdued if the player is in possession of a
.Em virgin .
.It Em Modnar
has random characteristics, including treasure type.
.It Em Mimic
will pick another name from the list of monsters in order to confuse.
.It Em Dark Lord
very nasty person.

and many spells do not work well (or at all) against him.
One can always
.Em evade
from the
.Em Dark Lord .
.It Em Leanan-Sidhe
also a very nasty person.
She will permanently sap
.Em strength
from someone.
.It Em Saruman

This is a very easy way to die.
.It Em Cerberus

.It Em Ungoliant
can bite and poison.
This inflicts five

may tire of battle, and leave after calling one of his friends
.Em ( Jubjub Bird
or
.Em Bandersnatch ) .
.It Em Morgoth

.It Em Troll
may regenerate its
.Em energy
and

.br

These preserve any spells that were already in effect, but are only in
effect while in battle.
.It Type five
.Em dagger
\- adds to
.Em strength .
.br
.Em armour
\- same as a
.Em shield ,

.El
.Pp
Any treasure type 10-13 monsters may instead carry a type nine treasure.
.Pp
A monster may also be carrying
.Em gold
or
.Em gems .
These are used at
.Em trading posts
to buy things.
A
.Em gem
is worth 1000 gold pieces.
Too much
.Em gold
will slow a player down.
One may carry 1000 plus 200 per
.Em level
of
.Em gold .
A
.Em gem
weighs one half a gold piece.
Monsters of treasure type 7 or higher may carry
.Em gems .
.Pp
The chance of a cursed treasure is based upon treasure type.
The more valuable treasures have a greater chance of being cursed.
A cursed treasure knocks
.Em energy level
very low and adds 0.25
.Em poison .
.Ss Rings
.Em Rings
are only carried by
.Em nazguls
and
.Em Dark Lords .
They come in four different flavors.
All
.Em rings
rest the player to maximum,
and cause them to hit much harder
in battle with monsters (assuming the
.Em ring
is being used for battle.)
.Pp
Two types of
.Em rings
are cursed and come either from
.Em nazguls
or
.Em Dark Lords .
After a few times of using these types, the player falls
under the control of the
.Em ring ,
and strange, random things will occur.
Eventually, the player dies,
and the player's name is given to a monster on the file.
Dying before the
.Em ring
is used up also renames the monster.
.Pp
The two remaining types of
.Em rings
are much more benign.
The one from a
.Em nazgul
is good for a limited number of battle rounds, and will save
the player from death if it was being used.
The one from
.Em Dark Lord
is the same, except that it never is used up.
.Em rings
disappear after saving someone from death.
In general, cursed
.Em rings
occur much more often than normal ones.
It is usually not a good idea to pick one up.
The only way to get rid of a
.Em ring
is to have a monster steal it.
.Ss King
A player may become
.Em king
by finding a
.Em crown
and going to (0,0).
Players must have a
.Em level
in the range of 10 to 1000 to be able to find a
.Em crown .
When a player with one or more
.Em crowns
reaches
.Em level
1000, the
.Em crowns
are converted to
.Em gold .
.Pp
Once a player is king, they may do certain things while in
the Lord's Chamber (0,0).
These are exercised with the
.Ic decree
('0') option.
.Bl -tag -width "collect taxes"
.It Ic transport
This is done to another player.
It randomly moves the affected player about.
A
.Em charm
protects from transports.
.It Ic curse
This is done to another player.
It is analogous to cursed treasure, but worse.
It inflicts two
.Em poison ,
knocks
.Em energy level
very low, and degrades the maximum energy.
It also removes a
.Em cloak .
A
.Em blessing
protects from king's curses.
.It Ic energy void
The king may put a number of these scattered about
the kingdom.
If a player hits one, they lose
.Em mana , energy ,
and
.Em gold .
The energy void disappears after being hit.
.It Ic bestow
This is also done to another player.
The king may wish to reward one or more loyal subjects by sharing
.Em gold .
Or it is a convenient way to dispose of some unwanted deadweight.
.It Ic collect taxes
Everyone pays 7% tax on all
.Em gold
and
.Em gems
acquired, regardless of the existence of a
.Em king .
The king collects the accrued taxes with this option.
.El
.Pp
The
.Em king
may also
.Ic teleport
anywhere for free by using the origin as a starting place.
.Ss Council of the Wise, Valar
A player automatically becomes a member of the
.Em council of the wise
upon reaching level 3000.
Members of the council cannot have
.Em rings .
Members of the council have a few extra options which they can exercise.
These are exercised with the
.Ic intervene
.Pq Sq 8
option.
All
.Ic intervene
options cost 1000 mana.
One
.Ic intervene
option is to
.Ic heal
another player.
This is just a quick way for that player to be rested
to maximum and lose a little
.Em poison .
The main purpose in life for members of the council is to seek the
.Em Holy Grail .
This is done with a
.Em palantir
under the
.Ic seek grail
option.
The distance cited by the seek is accurate within 10%, in order
not to make it too easy to find the grail.
A player must have infinitesimally small
.Em sin ,
or else it's all over upon finding the grail.
In order to help members of the council on their quest, they
may
.Ic teleport
with greater ease.
.Pp
Upon finding the grail, players advance to position of
.Em valar .
They may then exercise more and niftier options under
.Ic intervention .
These include all of the council members' options plus the
ability to move other players about, bless them, and throw monsters at
them.
A
.Em valar Ns 's
blessing has the same effect as the treasure
.Em blessing ,
except that the affected player does not get the
.Em blessing
flag set.
All
.Ic intervention
options which affect other players age the player who uses them.
.Em Valars
are essentially immortal, but are actually given five lives.
If these are used up, the player is left to die, and becomes an
.Em ex-valar .
A
.Em valar
cannot
