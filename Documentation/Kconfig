config WARN_MISSING_DOCUMENTS
	bool "Warn if there's a missing documentation file"
	depends on COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  It is not uncommon that a document gets renamed.
	  This option makes the Kernel to check for missing dependencies,
	  warning when something is missing. Works only if the Kernel
	  is built from a git tree.

	  If unsure, select 'N'.

config WARN_ABI_ERRORS
	bool "Warn if there are errors at ABI files"
	depends on COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  The files under Documentation/ABI should follow what's
	  described at Documentation/ABI/README. Yet, as they're manually
	  written, it would be possible that some of those files would
	  have errors that would break them for being parsed by
	  scripts/get_abi.pl. Add a check to verify them.

	  If unsure, select 'N'.
