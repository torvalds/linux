title: TI J721e System Controller Registers R/W Device Tree Bindings

description: |
  This represents the Control Module registers (CTRL_MMR0) on the SoC.
  System controller node represents a register region containing a set
  of miscellaneous registers. The registers are not cohesive enough to
  represent as any specific type of device. The typical use-case is
  for some other node's driver, or platform-specific code, to acquire
  a reference to the syscon node (e.g. by phandle, node path, or
  search using a specific compatible value), interrogate the node (or
  associated OS driver) to determine the location of the registers,
  and access the registers directly.
