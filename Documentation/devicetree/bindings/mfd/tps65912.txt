* TPS65912 Power Management Integrated Circuit bindings

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "ti,tps65912".
 - reg			: Slave address or chip select number (I2C / SPI).
 - interrupt-parent	: The parent interrupt controller.
 - interrupts		: The interrupt line the device is connected to.
 - interrupt-controller	: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
 - #interrupt-cells	: The number of cells to describe an IRQ, should be 2.
			    The first cell is the IRQ number.
			    The second cell is the flags, encoded as trigger
			    masks from ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt.
 - gpio-controller	: Marks the device node as a GPIO Controller.
 - #gpio-cells		: Should be two.  The first cell is the pin number and
			    the second cell is used to specify flags.
			    See ../gpio/gpio.txt for more information.
 - regulators:		: List of child nodes that specify the regulator
			    initialization data. Child nodes must be named
			    after their hardware counterparts: dcdc[1-4] and
			    ldo[1-10]. Each child nodes is defined using the
			    standard binding for regulators.

Example:

	pmic: tps65912@2d {
		compatible = "ti,tps65912";
		reg = <0x2d>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
		interrupts = <28 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;

		regulators {
			dcdc1 {
				regulator-name = "vdd_core";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <912000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1144000>;
				regulator-boot-on;
				regulator-always-on;
			};

			ldo1 {
				regulator-name = "ldo1";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1900000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1900000>;
			};
		};
	};
