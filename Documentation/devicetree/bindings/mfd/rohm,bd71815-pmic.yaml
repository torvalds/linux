description: |
  BD71815AGW is a single-chip power management ICs for battery-powered
  portable devices. It integrates 5 buck converters, 8 LDOs, a boost driver
  for LED and a 500 mA single-cell linear charger. Also included is a Coulomb
  counter, a real-time clock (RTC), and a 32.768 kHz clock gate and two GPOs.

    description: |
      BD71815 has SAR ADC for measuring charging currents. External sense
      resistor (RSENSE in data sheet) should be used. If something other
      but a 30 mOhm resistor is used the resistance value should be given
      here in micro Ohms.
    default: 30000

  gpio-reserved-ranges:
    description: |
      Usage of BD71815 GPIO pins can be changed via OTP. This property can be
      used to mark the pins which should not be configured for GPIO. Please see
      the ../gpio/gpio.txt for more information.

  rohm,enable-hidden-gpo:
    description: |
      The BD71815 has undocumented GPO at pin E5. Pin is marked as GND at the
      data-sheet as its location in the middle of GND pins makes it hard to
      use on PCB. If your board has managed to use this pin you can enable the
      second GPO by defining this property. Dont enable this if you are unsure
      about how the E5 pin is connected on your board.
