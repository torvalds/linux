	sky81452@2c {
		compatible = "skyworks,sky81452";
		reg = <0x2c>;

		backlight {
			compatible = "skyworks,sky81452-backlight";
			name = "pwm-backlight";
			led-sources = <0 1 2 3 6>;
			skyworks,ignore-pwm;
			skyworks,phase-shift;
			skyworks,current-limit = <2300>;
		};

		regulator {
			lout {
				regulator-name = "sky81452-lout";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <4500000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <8000000>;
			};
