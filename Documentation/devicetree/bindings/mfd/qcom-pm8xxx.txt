Qualcomm PM8xxx PMIC multi-function devices

The PM8xxx family of Power Management ICs are used to provide regulated
voltages and other various functionality to Qualcomm SoCs.

= PROPERTIES

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,pm8058"
		    "qcom,pm8921"

- #address-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be 1

- #size-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be 0

- interrupts:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: specifies the interrupt that indicates a subdevice
		    has generated an interrupt (summary interrupt). The
		    format of the specifier is defined by the binding document
		    describing the node's interrupt parent.

- #interrupt-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type : <u32>
	Definition: must be 2. Specifies the number of cells needed to encode
		    an interrupt source. The 1st cell contains the interrupt
		    number. The 2nd cell is the trigger type and level flags
		    encoded as follows:

			1 = low-to-high edge triggered
			2 = high-to-low edge triggered
			4 = active high level-sensitive
			8 = active low level-sensitive

- interrupt-controller:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <empty>
	Definition: identifies this node as an interrupt controller

= SUBCOMPONENTS

The PMIC contains multiple independent functions, each described in a subnode.
The below bindings specify the set of valid subnodes.

== Real-Time Clock

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,pm8058-rtc"
		    "qcom,pm8921-rtc"
		    "qcom,pm8941-rtc"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: single entry specifying the base address of the RTC registers

- interrupts:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: single entry specifying the RTC's alarm interrupt

- allow-set-time:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <empty>
	Definition: indicates that the setting of RTC time is allowed by
		    the host CPU

= EXAMPLE

	pmicintc: pmic@0 {
		compatible = "qcom,pm8921";
		interrupts = <104 8>;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		rtc@11d {
			compatible = "qcom,pm8921-rtc";
			reg = <0x11d>;
			interrupts = <0x27 0>;
		};
	};
