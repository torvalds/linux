* Altera Arria10 Development Kit System Resource Chip

Required parent device properties:
- compatible		: "altr,a10sr"
- spi-max-frequency	: Maximum SPI frequency.
- reg			: The SPI Chip Select address for the Arria10
			  System Resource chip
- interrupt-parent	: The parent interrupt controller.
- interrupts		: The interrupt line the device is connected to.
- interrupt-controller	: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells	: The number of cells to describe an IRQ, should be 2.
			    The first cell is the IRQ number.
			    The second cell is the flags, encoded as trigger
			    masks from ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt.

The A10SR consists of these sub-devices:

Device                   Description
------                   ----------
a10sr_gpio               GPIO Controller

Arria10 GPIO
Required Properties:
- compatible        : Should be "altr,a10sr-gpio"
- gpio-controller   : Marks the device node as a GPIO Controller.
- #gpio-cells       : Should be two.  The first cell is the pin number and
                      the second cell is used to specify flags.
                      See ../gpio/gpio.txt for more information.

Example:

        resource-manager@0 {
		compatible = "altr,a10sr";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <100000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&portb>;
		interrupts = <5 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;

		a10sr_gpio: gpio-controller {
			compatible = "altr,a10sr-gpio";
			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells = <2>;
		};
	};
