* Device tree bindings for Atmel Bus Matrix

The Bus Matrix registers are used to configure Atmel SoCs internal bus
behavior (master/slave priorities, undefined burst length type, ...)

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be one of the following
			"atmel,at91sam9260-matrix", "syscon"
			"atmel,at91sam9261-matrix", "syscon"
			"atmel,at91sam9263-matrix", "syscon"
			"atmel,at91sam9rl-matrix", "syscon"
			"atmel,at91sam9g45-matrix", "syscon"
			"atmel,at91sam9n12-matrix", "syscon"
			"atmel,at91sam9x5-matrix", "syscon"
			"atmel,sama5d3-matrix", "syscon"
- reg:			Contains offset/length value of the Bus Matrix
			memory region.

Example:

matrix: matrix@ffffec00 {
	compatible = "atmel,sama5d3-matrix", "syscon";
	reg = <0xffffec00 0x200>;
};
