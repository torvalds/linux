title: Aspeed Low Pin Count (LPC) Bus Controller

description:
  The LPC bus is a means to bridge a host CPU to a number of low-bandwidth
  peripheral devices, replacing the use of the ISA bus in the age of PCI[0]. The
  primary use case of the Aspeed LPC controller is as a slave on the bus
  (typically in a Baseboard Management Controller SoC), but under certain
  conditions it can also take the role of bus master.

  The LPC controller is represented as a multi-function device to account for the
  mix of functionality, which includes, but is not limited to

  * An IPMI Block Transfer[2] Controller

  * An LPC Host Interface Controller manages functions exposed to the host such
    as LPC firmware hub cycles, configuration of the LPC-to-AHB mapping, UART
    management and bus snoop configuration.

  * A set of SuperIO[3] scratch registers enabling implementation of e.g. custom
    hardware management protocols for handover between the host and baseboard
    management controller.

  Additionally the state of the LPC controller influences the pinmux
  configuration, therefore the host portion of the controller is exposed as a
  syscon as a means to arbitrate access.
