* Device tree bindings for Atmel SMC (Static Memory Controller)

The SMC registers are used to configure Atmel EBI (External Bus Interface)
to interface with standard memory devices (NAND, NOR, SRAM or specialized
devices like FPGAs).

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be one of the following
			"atmel,at91sam9260-smc", "syscon"
			"atmel,sama5d3-smc", "syscon"
			"atmel,sama5d2-smc", "syscon"
- reg:			Contains offset/length value of the SMC memory
			region.

Example:

smc: smc@ffffc000 {
	compatible = "atmel,sama5d3-smc", "syscon";
	reg = <0xffffc000 0x1000>;
};
