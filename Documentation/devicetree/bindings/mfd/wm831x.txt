Cirrus Logic/Wolfson Microelectronics wm831x PMICs

System PMICs with a wide range of additional features.

Required properties:

  - compatible : One of the following chip-specific strings:
        "wlf,wm8310"
        "wlf,wm8311"
        "wlf,wm8312"
        "wlf,wm8320"
        "wlf,wm8321"
        "wlf,wm8325"
        "wlf,wm8326"

  - reg : I2C slave address when connected using I2C, chip select number
    when using SPI.

  - gpio-controller : Indicates this device is a GPIO controller.
  - #gpio-cells : Must be 2. The first cell is the pin number and the
    second cell is used to specify optional parameters (currently unused).

  - interrupts : The interrupt line the IRQ signal for the device is
    connected to.
  - interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.

  - interrupt-controller : wm831x devices contain interrupt controllers and
    may provide interrupt services to other devices.
  - #interrupt-cells: Must be 2. The first cell is the IRQ number, and the
    second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger masks from
    ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

Optional sub-nodes:
  - phys : Contains a phandle to the USB PHY.
  - regulators : Contains sub-nodes for each of the regulators supplied by
    the device. The regulators are bound using their names listed below:

    dcdc1 : DCDC1
    dcdc2 : DCDC2
    dcdc3 : DCDC3
    dcdc4 : DCDC3
    isink1 : ISINK1
    isink2 : ISINK2
    ldo1 : LDO1
    ldo2 : LDO2
    ldo3 : LDO3
    ldo4 : LDO4
    ldo5 : LDO5
    ldo7 : LDO7
    ldo11 : LDO11

    The bindings details of each regulator can be found in:
    ../regulator/regulator.txt

Example:

wm8310: pmic@36 {
	compatible = "wlf,wm8310";
	reg = <0x36>;

	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;

	interrupts = <347>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;

	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;

	regulators {
		dcdc1: dcdc1 {
			regulator-name = "DCDC1";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <600000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <600000>;
		};
		ldo1: ldo1 {
			regulator-name = "LDO1";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <1700000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1700000>;
		};
	};
};
