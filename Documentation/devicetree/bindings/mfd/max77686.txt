Maxim MAX77686 multi-function device

MAX77686 is a Multifunction device with PMIC, RTC and Charger on chip. It is
interfaced to host controller using i2c interface. PMIC and Charger submodules
are addressed using same i2c slave address whereas RTC submodule uses
different i2c slave address,presently for which we are statically creating i2c
client while probing.This document describes the binding for mfd device and
PMIC submodule.

Bindings for the built-in 32k clock generator block and
regulators are defined in ../clk/maxim,max77686.txt and
../regulator/max77686.txt respectively.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "maxim,max77686";
- reg : Specifies the i2c slave address of PMIC block.
- interrupts : This i2c device has an IRQ line connected to the main SoC.
- interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.

Example:

	max77686: pmic@09 {
		compatible = "maxim,max77686";
		interrupt-parent = <&wakeup_eint>;
		interrupts = <26 0>;
		reg = <0x09>;
	};
