description:
  The THP7312 is a standalone ISP controlled over i2c, and is capable of
  various image processing and correction functions, including 3A control. It
  can be connected to CMOS image sensors from various vendors, supporting both
  MIPI CSI-2 and parallel interfaces. It can also output on either MIPI CSI-2
  or parallel. The hardware is capable of transmitting and receiving MIPI
  interleaved data streams with data types or multiple virtual channel
  identifiers.
