title: Dongwoon Anatech DW9768 Voice Coil Motor (VCM) Lens

maintainers:
  - Dongchun Zhu <dongchun.zhu@mediatek.com>

description: |-
  The Dongwoon DW9768 is a single 10-bit digital-to-analog (DAC) converter
  with 100 mA output current sink capability. VCM current is controlled with
  a linear mode driver. The DAC is controlled via a 2-wire (I2C-compatible)
  serial interface that operates at clock rates up to 1MHz. This chip
  integrates Advanced Actuator Control (AAC) technology and is intended for
  driving voice coil lenses in camera modules.
