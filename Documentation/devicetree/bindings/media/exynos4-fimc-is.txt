Exynos4x12 SoC series Imaging Subsystem (FIMC-IS)

The FIMC-IS is a subsystem for processing image signal from an image sensor.
The Exynos4x12 SoC series FIMC-IS V1.5 comprises of a dedicated ARM Cortex-A5
processor, ISP, DRC and FD IP blocks and peripheral devices such as UART, I2C
and SPI bus controllers, PWM and ADC.

fimc-is node
------------

Required properties:
- compatible	: should be "samsung,exynos4212-fimc-is" for Exynos4212 and
		  Exynos4412 SoCs;
- reg		: physical base address and length of the registers set;
- interrupts	: must contain two FIMC-IS interrupts, in order: ISP0, ISP1;
- clocks	: list of clock specifiers, corresponding to entries in
		  clock-names property;
- clock-names	: must contain "ppmuispx", "ppmuispx", "lite0", "lite1"
		  "mpll", "sysreg", "isp", "drc", "fd", "mcuisp", "uart",
		  "ispdiv0", "ispdiv1", "mcuispdiv0", "mcuispdiv1", "aclk200",
		  "div_aclk200", "aclk400mcuisp", "div_aclk400mcuisp" entries,
		  matching entries in the clocks property.
pmu subnode
-----------

Required properties:
 - reg : must contain PMU physical base address and size of the register set.

The following are the FIMC-IS peripheral device nodes and can be specified
either standalone or as the fimc-is node child nodes.

i2c-isp (ISP I2C bus controller) nodes
------------------------------------------

Required properties:

- compatible	: should be "samsung,exynos4212-i2c-isp" for Exynos4212 and
		  Exynos4412 SoCs;
- reg		: physical base address and length of the registers set;
- clocks	: must contain gate clock specifier for this controller;
- clock-names	: must contain "i2c_isp" entry.

For the above nodes it is required to specify a pinctrl state named "default",
according to the pinctrl bindings defined in ../pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt.

Device tree nodes of the image sensors' controlled directly by the FIMC-IS
firmware must be child nodes of their corresponding ISP I2C bus controller node.
The data link of these image sensors must be specified using the common video
interfaces bindings, defined in video-interfaces.txt.
