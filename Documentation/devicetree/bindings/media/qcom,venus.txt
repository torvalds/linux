- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Register base address and length of the register map.
- interrupts:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Should contain interrupt line number.
- clocks:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A List of phandle and clock specifier pairs as listed
		    in clock-names property.
- clock-names:
	Usage: required for msm8916
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Should contain the following entries:
		- "core"	Core video accelerator clock
		- "iface"	Video accelerator AHB clock

- clock-names:
	Usage: required for msm8996
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Should contain the following entries:
		- "core"	Core video accelerator clock
		- "iface"	Video accelerator AHB clock
		- "bus"		Video accelerator AXI clock
		- "mbus"	Video MAXI clock
- power-domains:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A phandle and power domain specifier pairs to the
		    power domain which is responsible for collapsing
		    and restoring power to the peripheral.
- iommus:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A list of phandle and IOMMU specifier pairs.
- memory-region:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the reserved-memory for the firmware
		    memory region.

* Subnodes
The Venus video-codec node must contain two subnodes representing
video-decoder and video-encoder.

Every of video-encoder or video-decoder subnode should have:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Value should contain "venus-decoder" or "venus-encoder"
- clocks:
	Usage: required for msm8996
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A List of phandle and clock specifier pairs as listed
		    in clock-names property.
- clock-names:
	Usage: required for msm8996
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Should contain the following entries:
		- "core"	Subcore video accelerator clock

- power-domains:
	Usage: required for msm8996
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: A phandle and power domain specifier pairs to the
		    power domain which is responsible for collapsing
		    and restoring power to the subcore.
