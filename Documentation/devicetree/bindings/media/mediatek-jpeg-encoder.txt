* MediaTek JPEG Encoder

MediaTek JPEG Encoder is the JPEG encode hardware present in MediaTek SoCs

Required properties:
- compatible : "mediatek,mt2701-jpgenc"
  followed by "mediatek,mtk-jpgenc"
- reg : physical base address of the JPEG encoder registers and length of
  memory mapped region.
- interrupts : interrupt number to the interrupt controller.
- clocks: device clocks, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: must contain "jpgenc". It is the clock of JPEG encoder.
- power-domains: a phandle to the power domain, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt for details.
- mediatek,larb: must contain the local arbiters in the current SoCs, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/memory-controllers/mediatek,smi-larb.txt
  for details.
- iommus: should point to the respective IOMMU block with master port as
  argument, see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/mediatek,iommu.txt
  for details.

Example:
	jpegenc: jpegenc@1500a000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt2701-jpgenc",
			     "mediatek,mtk-jpgenc";
		reg = <0 0x1500a000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 141 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks =  <&imgsys CLK_IMG_VENC>;
		clock-names = "jpgenc";
		power-domains = <&scpsys MT2701_POWER_DOMAIN_ISP>;
		mediatek,larb = <&larb2>;
		iommus = <&iommu MT2701_M4U_PORT_JPGENC_RDMA>,
			 <&iommu MT2701_M4U_PORT_JPGENC_BSDMA>;
	};
