* Renesas VSP Video Processing Engine

The VSP is a video processing engine that supports up-/down-scaling, alpha
blending, color space conversion and various other image processing features.
It can be found in the Renesas R-Car second generation SoCs.

Required properties:

  - compatible: Must contain one of the following values
    - "renesas,vsp1" for the R-Car Gen2 VSP1
    - "renesas,vsp2" for the R-Car Gen3 VSP2

  - reg: Base address and length of the registers block for the VSP.
  - interrupts: VSP interrupt specifier.
  - clocks: A phandle + clock-specifier pair for the VSP functional clock.

Optional properties:

  - renesas,fcp: A phandle referencing the FCP that handles memory accesses
                 for the VSP. Not needed on Gen2, mandatory on Gen3.


Example: R8A7790 (R-Car H2) VSP1-S node

	vsp1@fe928000 {
		compatible = "renesas,vsp1";
		reg = <0 0xfe928000 0 0x8000>;
		interrupts = <0 267 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&mstp1_clks R8A7790_CLK_VSP1_S>;
	};
