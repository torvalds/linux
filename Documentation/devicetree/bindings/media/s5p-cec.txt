* Samsung HDMI CEC driver

The HDMI CEC module is present is Samsung SoCs and its purpose is to
handle communication between HDMI connected devices over the CEC bus.

Required properties:
  - compatible : value should be following
	"samsung,s5p-cec"

  - reg : Physical base address of the IP registers and length of memory
	  mapped region.

  - interrupts : HDMI CEC interrupt number to the CPU.
  - clocks : from common clock binding: handle to HDMI CEC clock.
  - clock-names : from common clock binding: must contain "hdmicec",
		  corresponding to entry in the clocks property.
  - samsung,syscon-phandle - phandle to the PMU system controller
  - hdmi-phandle - phandle to the HDMI controller, see also cec.txt.

Optional:
  - needs-hpd : if present the CEC support is only available when the HPD
		is high. See cec.txt for more details.

Example:

hdmicec: cec@100B0000 {
	compatible = "samsung,s5p-cec";
	reg = <0x100B0000 0x200>;
	interrupts = <0 114 0>;
	clocks = <&clock CLK_HDMI_CEC>;
	clock-names = "hdmicec";
	samsung,syscon-phandle = <&pmu_system_controller>;
	hdmi-phandle = <&hdmi>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&hdmi_cec>;
	status = "okay";
};
