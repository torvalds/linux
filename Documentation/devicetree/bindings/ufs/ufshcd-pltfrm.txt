* Universal Flash Storage (UFS) Host Controller

UFSHC nodes are defined to describe on-chip UFS host controllers.
Each UFS controller instance should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible		: must contain "jedec,ufs-1.1", may also list one or more
					  of the following:
					  "qcom,msm8994-ufshc"
					  "qcom,msm8996-ufshc"
					  "qcom,ufshc"
- interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for UFS host controller IRQ>
- reg               : <registers mapping>

Optional properties:
- phys                  : phandle to UFS PHY node
- phy-names             : the string "ufsphy" when is found in a node, along
                          with "phys" attribute, provides phandle to UFS PHY node
- vdd-hba-supply        : phandle to UFS host controller supply regulator node
- vcc-supply            : phandle to VCC supply regulator node
- vccq-supply           : phandle to VCCQ supply regulator node
- vccq2-supply          : phandle to VCCQ2 supply regulator node
- vcc-supply-1p8        : For embedded UFS devices, valid VCC range is 1.7-1.95V
                          or 2.7-3.6V. This boolean property when set, specifies
			  to use low voltage range of 1.7-1.95V. Note for external
			  UFS cards this property is invalid and valid VCC range is
			  always 2.7-3.6V.
- vcc-max-microamp      : specifies max. load that can be drawn from vcc supply
- vccq-max-microamp     : specifies max. load that can be drawn from vccq supply
- vccq2-max-microamp    : specifies max. load that can be drawn from vccq2 supply
- <name>-fixed-regulator : boolean property specifying that <name>-supply is a fixed regulator

- clocks                : List of phandle and clock specifier pairs
- clock-names           : List of clock input name strings sorted in the same
                          order as the clocks property.
- freq-table-hz		: Array of <min max> operating frequencies stored in the same
                          order as the clocks property. If this property is not
			  defined or a value in the array is "0" then it is assumed
			  that the frequency is set by the parent clock or a
			  fixed rate clock source.
-lanes-per-direction	: number of lanes available per direction - either 1 or 2.
			  Note that it is assume same number of lanes is used both
			  directions at once. If not specified, default is 2 lanes per direction.

Note: If above properties are not defined it can be assumed that the supply
regulators or clocks are always on.

Example:
	ufshc@0xfc598000 {
		compatible = "jedec,ufs-1.1";
		reg = <0xfc598000 0x800>;
		interrupts = <0 28 0>;

		vdd-hba-supply = <&xxx_reg0>;
		vdd-hba-fixed-regulator;
		vcc-supply = <&xxx_reg1>;
		vcc-supply-1p8;
		vccq-supply = <&xxx_reg2>;
		vccq2-supply = <&xxx_reg3>;
		vcc-max-microamp = 500000;
		vccq-max-microamp = 200000;
		vccq2-max-microamp = 200000;

		clocks = <&core 0>, <&ref 0>, <&iface 0>;
		clock-names = "core_clk", "ref_clk", "iface_clk";
		freq-table-hz = <100000000 200000000>, <0 0>, <0 0>;
		phys = <&ufsphy1>;
		phy-names = "ufsphy";
	};
