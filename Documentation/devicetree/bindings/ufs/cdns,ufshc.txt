* Cadence Universal Flash Storage (UFS) Controller

UFS nodes are defined to describe on-chip UFS host controllers.
Each UFS controller instance should have its own node.
Please see the ufshcd-pltfrm.txt for a list of all available properties.

Required properties:
- compatible	: Compatible list, contains the following controller:
			"cdns,ufshc"
		  complemented with the JEDEC version:
			"jedec,ufs-2.0"

- reg		: Address and length of the UFS register set.
- interrupts	: One interrupt mapping.
- freq-table-hz	: Clock frequency table.
		  See the ufshcd-pltfrm.txt for details.
- clocks	: List of phandle and clock specifier pairs.
- clock-names	: List of clock input name strings sorted in the same
		  order as the clocks property. "core_clk" is mandatory.
		  Depending on a type of a PHY,
		  the "phy_clk" clock can also be added, if needed.

Example:
	ufs@fd030000 {
		compatible = "cdns,ufshc", "jedec,ufs-2.0";
		reg = <0xfd030000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <0 1 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		freq-table-hz = <0 0>, <0 0>;
		clocks = <&ufs_core_clk>, <&ufs_phy_clk>;
		clock-names = "core_clk", "phy_clk";
	};
