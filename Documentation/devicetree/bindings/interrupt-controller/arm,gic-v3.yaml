  AArch64 SMP cores are often associated with a GICv3, providing Private
  Peripheral Interrupts (PPI), Shared Peripheral Interrupts (SPI),
  Software Generated Interrupts (SGI), and Locality-specific Peripheral
  Interrupts (LPI).

  "#interrupt-cells":
    description: |
      Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt source.
      Must be a single cell with a value of at least 3.
      If the system requires describing PPI affinity, then the value must
      be at least 4.

      The 1st cell is the interrupt type; 0 for SPI interrupts, 1 for PPI
      interrupts, 2 for interrupts in the Extended SPI range, 3 for the
      Extended PPI range. Other values are reserved for future use.

      The 2nd cell contains the interrupt number for the interrupt type.
      SPI interrupts are in the range [0-987]. PPI interrupts are in the
      range [0-15]. Extented SPI interrupts are in the range [0-1023].
      Extended PPI interrupts are in the range [0-127].

      The 3rd cell is the flags, encoded as follows:
      bits[3:0] trigger type and level flags.
        1 = edge triggered
        4 = level triggered

      The 4th cell is a phandle to a node describing a set of CPUs this
      interrupt is affine to. The interrupt must be a PPI, and the node
      pointed must be a subnode of the "ppi-partitions" subnode. For
      interrupt types other than PPI or PPIs that are not partitionned,
      this cell must be zero. See the "ppi-partitions" node description
      below.

      Cells 5 and beyond are reserved for future use and must have a value
      of 0 if present.
    enum: [ 3, 4 ]

      Specifies base physical address(s) and size of the GIC
      registers, in the following order:
      - GIC Distributor interface (GICD)
      - GIC Redistributors (GICR), one range per redistributor region
      - GIC CPU interface (GICC)
      - GIC Hypervisor interface (GICH)
      - GIC Virtual CPU interface (GICV)

      GICC, GICH and GICV are optional, but must be described if the CPUs
      support them. Examples of such CPUs are ARM's implementations of the
      ARMv8.0 architecture such as Cortex-A32, A34, A35, A53, A57, A72 and
      A73 (this list is not exhaustive).
