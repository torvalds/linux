description: |
  The Apple Interrupt Controller is a simple interrupt controller present on
  Apple ARM SoC platforms, including various iPhone and iPad devices and the
  "Apple Silicon" Macs.

  It provides the following features:

  - Level-triggered hardware IRQs wired to SoC blocks
    - Single mask bit per IRQ
    - Per-IRQ affinity setting
    - Automatic masking on event delivery (auto-ack)
    - Software triggering (ORed with hw line)
  - 2 per-CPU IPIs (meant as "self" and "other", but they are interchangeable
    if not symmetric)
  - Automatic prioritization (single event/ack register per CPU, lower IRQs =
    higher priority)
  - Automatic masking on ack
  - Default "this CPU" register view and explicit per-CPU views

  This device also represents the FIQ interrupt sources on platforms using AIC,
  which do not go through a discrete interrupt controller.

      The 1st cell contains the interrupt type:
        - 0: Hardware IRQ
        - 1: FIQ

      The 2nd cell contains the interrupt number.
        - HW IRQs: interrupt number
        - FIQs:
          - 0: physical HV timer
          - 1: virtual HV timer
          - 2: physical guest timer
          - 3: virtual guest timer
          - 4: 'efficient' CPU PMU
          - 5: 'performance' CPU PMU

      The 3rd cell contains the interrupt flags. This is normally
      IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH (4).
