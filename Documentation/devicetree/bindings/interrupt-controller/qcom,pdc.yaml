title: PDC interrupt controller

description: |
  Qualcomm Technologies Inc. SoCs based on the RPM Hardened architecture have a
  Power Domain Controller (PDC) that is on always-on domain. In addition to
  providing power control for the power domains, the hardware also has an
  interrupt controller that can be used to help detect edge low interrupts as
  well detect interrupts when the GIC is non-operational.

  GIC is parent interrupt controller at the highest level. Platform interrupt
  controller PDC is next in hierarchy, followed by others. Drivers requiring
  wakeup capabilities of their device interrupts routed through the PDC, must
  specify PDC as their interrupt controller and request the PDC port associated
  with the GIC interrupt. See example below.
