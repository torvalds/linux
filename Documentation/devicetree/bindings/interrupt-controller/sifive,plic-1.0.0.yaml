title: SiFive Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC)

description:
  SiFive SoCs and other RISC-V SoCs include an implementation of the
  Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC) high-level specification in
  the RISC-V Privileged Architecture specification. The PLIC connects all
  external interrupts in the system to all hart contexts in the system, via
  the external interrupt source in each hart.

  A hart context is a privilege mode in a hardware execution thread. For example,
  in an 4 core system with 2-way SMT, you have 8 harts and probably at least two
  privilege modes per hart; machine mode and supervisor mode.

  Each interrupt can be enabled on per-context basis. Any context can claim
  a pending enabled interrupt and then release it once it has been handled.

  Each interrupt has a configurable priority. Higher priority interrupts are
  serviced first.  Each context can specify a priority threshold. Interrupts
  with priority below this threshold will not cause the PLIC to raise its
  interrupt line leading to the context.

  While the PLIC supports both edge-triggered and level-triggered interrupts,
  interrupt handlers are oblivious to this distinction and therefore it is not
  specified in the PLIC device-tree binding.

  While the RISC-V ISA doesn't specify a memory layout for the PLIC, the
  "sifive,plic-1.0.0" device is a concrete implementation of the PLIC that
  contains a specific memory layout, which is documented in chapter 8 of the
  SiFive U5 Coreplex Series Manual <https://static.dev.sifive.com/U54-MC-RVCoreIP.pdf>.

  The thead,c900-plic is different from sifive,plic-1.0.0 in opensbi, the
  T-HEAD PLIC implementation requires setting a delegation bit to allow access
  from S-mode. So add thead,c900-plic to distinguish them.
