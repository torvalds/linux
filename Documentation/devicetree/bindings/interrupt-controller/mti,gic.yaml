description: |
  The MIPS GIC routes external interrupts to individual VPEs and IRQ pins.
  It also supports local (per-processor) interrupts and software-generated
  interrupts which can be used as IPIs. The GIC also includes a free-running
  global timer, per-CPU count/compare timers, and a watchdog.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: mti,gic

  "#interrupt-cells":
    const: 3
    description: |
      The 1st cell is the type of interrupt: local or shared defined in the
      file 'dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/mips-gic.h'. The 2nd cell is the
      GIC interrupt number. The 3d cell encodes the interrupt flags setting up
      the IRQ trigger modes, which are defined in the file
      'dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h'.

  reg:
    description: |
      Base address and length of the GIC registers space. If not present,
      the base address reported by the hardware GCR_GIC_BASE will be used.

  mti,reserved-cpu-vectors:
    description: |
      Specifies the list of CPU interrupt vectors to which the GIC may not
      route interrupts. This property is ignored if the CPU is started in EIC
      mode.

    maxItems: 6
    uniqueItems: true
    items:
      minimum: 2

  mti,reserved-ipi-vectors:
    description: |
      Specifies the range of GIC interrupts that are reserved for IPIs.
      It accepts two values: the 1st is the starting interrupt and the 2nd is
      the size of the reserved range. If not specified, the driver will
      allocate the last (2 * number of VPEs in the system).

  timer:
    type: object
    description: |
      MIPS GIC includes a free-running global timer, per-CPU count/compare
      timers, and a watchdog. Currently only the GIC Timer is supported.

      interrupts:
        description: |
          Interrupt for the GIC local timer, so normally it's suppose to be of
          <GIC_LOCAL X IRQ_TYPE_NONE> format.
