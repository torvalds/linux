description: |
  The Interrupt Router (INTR) module provides a mechanism to mux M
  interrupt inputs to N interrupt outputs, where all M inputs are selectable
  to be driven per N output. An Interrupt Router can either handle edge
  triggered or level triggered interrupts and that is fixed in hardware.

  There is one register per output (MUXCNTL_N) that controls the selection.
  Configuration of these MUXCNTL_N registers is done by a system controller
  (like the Device Memory and Security Controller on K3 AM654 SoC). System
  controller will keep track of the used and unused registers within the Router.
  Driver should request the system controller to get the range of GIC IRQs
  assigned to the requesting hosts. It is the drivers responsibility to keep
  track of Host IRQs.

  Communication between the host processor running an OS and the system
  controller happens through a protocol called TI System Control Interface
  (TISCI protocol).
