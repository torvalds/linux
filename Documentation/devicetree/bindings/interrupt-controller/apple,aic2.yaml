description: |
  The Apple Interrupt Controller 2 is a simple interrupt controller present on
  Apple ARM SoC platforms starting with t600x (M1 Pro and Max).

  It provides the following features:

  - Level-triggered hardware IRQs wired to SoC blocks
    - Single mask bit per IRQ
    - Automatic masking on event delivery (auto-ack)
    - Software triggering (ORed with hw line)
  - Automatic prioritization (single event/ack register per CPU, lower IRQs =
    higher priority)
  - Automatic masking on ack
  - Support for multiple dies

  This device also represents the FIQ interrupt sources on platforms using AIC,
  which do not go through a discrete interrupt controller. It also handles
  FIQ-based Fast IPIs.

      The 1st cell contains the interrupt type:
        - 0: Hardware IRQ
        - 1: FIQ

      The 2nd cell contains the die ID (only present on apple,t6000-aic).

      The next cell contains the interrupt number.
        - HW IRQs: interrupt number
        - FIQs:
          - 0: physical HV timer
          - 1: virtual HV timer
          - 2: physical guest timer
          - 3: virtual guest timer

      The last cell contains the interrupt flags. This is normally
      IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH (4).
