description: |
  Firmware implementing the SCPI described in ARM document number ARM DUI
  0922B ("ARM Compute Subsystem SCP: Message Interface Protocols")[0] can be
  used by Linux to initiate various system control and power operations.

  This binding is intended to define the interface the firmware implementing
  the SCPI provide for OSPM in the device tree.

          This sub-node represents one of the types of clock controller

          "arm,scpi-dvfs-clocks" - all the clocks that are variable and index
          based. These clocks don't provide an entire range of values between
          the limits but only discrete points within the range. The firmware
          provides the mapping for each such operating frequency and the index
          associated with it. The firmware also manages the voltage scaling
          appropriately with the clock scaling.

          "arm,scpi-variable-clocks" - all the clocks that are variable and
          provide full range within the specified range. The firmware provides
          the range of values within a specified range.
