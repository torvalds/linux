title: QEMU Firmware Configuration bindings

maintainers:

description: |
  Various QEMU emulation / virtualization targets provide the following
  Firmware Configuration interface on the "virt" machine type:

  - A write-only, 16-bit wide selector (or control) register,
  - a read-write, 64-bit wide data register.

  QEMU exposes the control and data register to guests as memory mapped
  registers; their location is communicated to the guest's UEFI firmware in the
  DTB that QEMU places at the bottom of the guest's DRAM.

  The authoritative guest-side hardware interface documentation to the fw_cfg
  device can be found in "docs/specs/fw_cfg.txt" in the QEMU source tree.

      * Bytes 0x0 to 0x7 cover the data register.
      * Bytes 0x8 to 0x9 cover the selector register.
      * Further registers may be appended to the region in case of future interface
        revisions / feature bits.
