description: |
  On the IXP4xx SoCs, the Network Processing Engine (NPE) is a small
  processor that can load a firmware to perform offloading of networking
  and crypto tasks. It also manages the MDIO bus to the ethernet PHYs
  on the IXP4xx platform. All IXP4xx platforms have three NPEs at
  consecutive memory locations. They are all included in the same
  device node since they are not independent of each other.
