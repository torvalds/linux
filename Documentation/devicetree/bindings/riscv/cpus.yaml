  This document uses some terminology common to the RISC-V community
  that is not widely used, the definitions of which are listed here:

  hart: A hardware execution context, which contains all the state
  mandated by the RISC-V ISA: a PC and some registers.  This
  terminology is designed to disambiguate software's view of execution
  contexts from any particular microarchitectural implementation
  strategy.  For example, an Intel laptop containing one socket with
  two cores, each of which has two hyperthreads, could be described as
  having four harts.
