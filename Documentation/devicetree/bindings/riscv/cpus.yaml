  This document uses some terminology common to the RISC-V community
  that is not widely used, the definitions of which are listed here:

  hart: A hardware execution context, which contains all the state
  mandated by the RISC-V ISA: a PC and some registers.  This
  terminology is designed to disambiguate software's view of execution
  contexts from any particular microarchitectural implementation
  strategy.  For example, an Intel laptop containing one socket with
  two cores, each of which has two hyperthreads, could be described as
  having four harts.

  riscv,isa:
    description:
      Identifies the specific RISC-V instruction set architecture
      supported by the hart.  These are documented in the RISC-V
      User-Level ISA document, available from
      https://riscv.org/specifications/

      Due to revisions of the ISA specification, some deviations
      have arisen over time.
      Notably, riscv,isa was defined prior to the creation of the
      Zicsr and Zifencei extensions and thus "i" implies
      "zicsr_zifencei".

      While the isa strings in ISA specification are case
      insensitive, letters in the riscv,isa string must be all
      lowercase to simplify parsing.
