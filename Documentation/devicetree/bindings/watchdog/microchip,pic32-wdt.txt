* Microchip PIC32 Watchdog Timer

When enabled, the watchdog peripheral can be used to reset the device if the
WDT is not cleared periodically in software.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "microchip,pic32mzda-wdt".
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- clocks: phandle of source clk. should be <&LPRC> clk.

Example:

	watchdog@1f800800 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32mzda-wdt";
		reg = <0x1f800800 0x200>;
		clocks = <&LPRC>;
	};
