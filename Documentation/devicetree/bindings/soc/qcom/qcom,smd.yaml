description:
  The Qualcomm Shared Memory Driver is a FIFO based communication channel for
  sending data between the various subsystems in Qualcomm platforms.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: qcom,smd

patternProperties:
  "^smd-edge|rpm$":
    $ref: /schemas/remoteproc/qcom,smd-edge.yaml#
    unevaluatedProperties: false
    description:
      Each subnode of the SMD node represents a remote subsystem or a remote
      processor of some sort - or in SMD language an "edge". The name of the
      edges are not important.

required:
  - compatible

additionalProperties: false

examples:
  # The following example represents a smd node, with one edge representing the
  # "rpm" subsystem. For the "rpm" subsystem we have a device tied to the
  # "rpm_request" channel.
