description: |
  Resource Power Manager Hardened (RPMH) is the mechanism for communicating
  with the hardened resource accelerators on Qualcomm SoCs. Requests to the
  resources can be written to the Trigger Command Set (TCS)  registers and
  using a (addr, val) pair and triggered. Messages in the TCS are then sent in
  sequence over an internal bus.

  The hardware block (Direct Resource Voter or DRV) is a part of the h/w entity
  (Resource State Coordinator a.k.a RSC) that can handle multiple sleep and
  active/wake resource requests. Multiple such DRVs can exist in a SoC and can
  be written to from Linux. The structure of each DRV follows the same template
  with a few variations that are captured by the properties here.

  A TCS may be triggered from Linux or triggered by the F/W after all the CPUs
  have powered off to facilitate idle power saving. TCS could be classified as::
    ACTIVE  - Triggered by Linux
    SLEEP   - Triggered by F/W
    WAKE    - Triggered by F/W
    CONTROL - Triggered by F/W
  See also:: <dt-bindings/soc/qcom,rpmh-rsc.h>

  The order in which they are described in the DT, should match the hardware
  configuration.

  Requests can be made for the state of a resource, when the subsystem is
  active or idle. When all subsystems like Modem, GPU, CPU are idle, the
  resource state will be an aggregate of the sleep votes from each of those
  subsystems. Clients may request a sleep value for their shared resources in
  addition to the active mode requests.

  Drivers that want to use the RSC to communicate with RPMH must specify their
  bindings as child nodes of the RSC controllers they wish to communicate with.
