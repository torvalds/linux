description: |
  The Qualcomm RPM (Resource Power Manager) architecture includes a concept
  of "RPM Masters". They can be thought of as "the local gang leaders", usually
  spanning a single subsystem (e.g. APSS, ADSP, CDSP). All of the RPM decisions
  (particularly around entering hardware-driven low power modes: XO shutdown
  and total system-wide power collapse) are first made at Master-level, and
  only then aggregated for the entire system.

  The Master Stats provide a few useful bits that can be used to assess whether
  our device has entered the desired low-power mode, how long it took to do so,
  the duration of that residence, how long it took to come back online,
  how many times a given sleep state was entered and which cores are actively
  voting for staying awake.

  This scheme has been used on various SoCs in the 2013-2023 era, with some
  newer or higher-end designs providing this information through an SMEM query.
