QMan Portal Node

Portals are memory mapped interfaces to QMan that allow low-latency, lock-less
interaction by software running on processor cores, accelerators and network
interfaces with the QMan

PROPERTIES

- compatible
	Usage:		Required
	Value type:	<stringlist>
	Definition:	Must include "fsl,qman-portal-<hardware revision>"
			May include "fsl,<SoC>-qman-portal" or "fsl,qman-portal"

- reg
	Usage:		Required
	Value type:	<prop-encoded-array>
	Definition:	Two regions. The first is the cache-enabled region of
			the portal. The second is the cache-inhibited region of
			the portal

- interrupts
	Usage:		Required
	Value type:	<prop-encoded-array>
	Definition:	Standard property

- fsl,liodn
	Usage:		See pamu.txt
	Value type:	<prop-encoded-array>
	Definition:	Two LIODN(s). DQRR LIODN (DLIODN) and Frame LIODN
			(FLIODN)

- fsl,iommu-parent
	Usage:		See pamu.txt
	Value type:	<phandle>
	Definition:	PAMU property used for dynamic LIODN assignment

	For additional details about the PAMU/LIODN binding(s) see pamu.txt

- cell-index
	Usage:		Required
	Value type:	<u32>
	Definition:	The hardware index of the channel. This can also be
			determined by dividing any of the channel's 8 work queue
			IDs by 8

In addition to these properties the qman-portals should have sub-nodes to
represent the HW devices/portals that are connected to the software portal
described here

The currently supported sub-nodes are:
	* fman0
	* fman1
	* pme
	* crypto

These subnodes should have the following properties:

- fsl,liodn
	Usage:		See pamu.txt
	Value type:	<prop-encoded-array>
	Definition:	PAMU property used for static LIODN assignment

- fsl,iommu-parent
	Usage:		See pamu.txt
	Value type:	<phandle>
	Definition:	PAMU property used for dynamic LIODN assignment

- dev-handle
	Usage:		Required
	Value type:	<phandle>
	Definition:	The phandle to the particular hardware device that this
			portal is connected to.

DPAA QMan Pool Channel Nodes

Pool Channels are defined with the following properties.

PROPERTIES

- compatible
	Usage:		Required
	Value type:	<stringlist>
	Definition:	Must include "fsl,qman-pool-channel"
			May include "fsl,<SoC>-qman-pool-channel"

- fsl,qman-channel-id
	Usage:		Required
	Value type:	<u32>
	Definition:	The hardware index of the channel. This can also be
			determined by dividing any of the channel's 8 work queue
			IDs by 8

EXAMPLE

The example below shows a (P4080) QMan portals container/bus node with two portals

	qman-portals@ff4200000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "simple-bus";
		ranges = <0 0xf 0xf4200000 0x200000>;

		qman-portal@0 {
			compatible = "fsl,qman-portal-1.2.0", "fsl,qman-portal";
			reg = <0 0x4000>, <0x100000 0x1000>;
			interrupts = <104 2 0 0>;
			fsl,liodn = <1 2>;
			fsl,qman-channel-id = <0>;

			fman0 {
				fsl,liodn = <0x21>;
				dev-handle = <&fman0>;
			};
			fman1 {
				fsl,liodn = <0xa1>;
				dev-handle = <&fman1>;
			};
			crypto {
				fsl,liodn = <0x41 0x66>;
				dev-handle = <&crypto>;
			};
		};
		qman-portal@4000 {
			compatible = "fsl,qman-portal-1.2.0", "fsl,qman-portal";
			reg = <0x4000 0x4000>, <0x101000 0x1000>;
			interrupts = <106 2 0 0>;
			fsl,liodn = <3 4>;
			cell-index = <1>;

			fman0 {
				fsl,liodn = <0x22>;
				dev-handle = <&fman0>;
			};
			fman1 {
				fsl,liodn = <0xa2>;
				dev-handle = <&fman1>;
			};
			crypto {
				fsl,liodn = <0x42 0x67>;
				dev-handle = <&crypto>;
			};
		};
	};
