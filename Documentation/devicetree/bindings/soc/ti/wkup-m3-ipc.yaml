description: |+
  The TI AM33xx and AM43xx family of devices use a small Cortex M3 co-processor
  (commonly referred to as Wakeup M3 or CM3) to help with various low power tasks
  that cannot be controlled from the MPU, like suspend/resume and certain deep
  C-states for CPU Idle. Once the wkup_m3_ipc driver uses the wkup_m3_rproc driver
  to boot the wkup_m3, it handles communication with the CM3 using IPC registers
  present in the SoC's control module and a mailbox. The wkup_m3_ipc exposes an
  API to allow the SoC PM code to execute specific PM tasks.

  Wkup M3 Device Node
  ====================
  A wkup_m3_ipc device node is used to represent the IPC registers within an
  SoC.

  Support for VTT Toggle
  ==================================
  On some boards like the AM335x EVM-SK and the AM437x GP EVM, a GPIO pin is
  connected to the enable pin on the DDR VTT regulator. This allows the
  regulator to be disabled upon suspend and enabled upon resume. Please note
  that the GPIO pin must be part of the GPIO0 module as only this GPIO module
  is in the wakeup power domain.
