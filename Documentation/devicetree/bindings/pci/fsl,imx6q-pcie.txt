* Freescale i.MX6 PCIe interface

This PCIe host controller is based on the Synopsys DesignWare PCIe IP
and thus inherits all the common properties defined in snps,dw-pcie.yaml.

Required properties:
- compatible:
	- "fsl,imx6q-pcie"
	- "fsl,imx6sx-pcie",
	- "fsl,imx6qp-pcie"
	- "fsl,imx7d-pcie"
	- "fsl,imx8mq-pcie"
- reg: base address and length of the PCIe controller
- interrupts: A list of interrupt outputs of the controller. Must contain an
  entry for each entry in the interrupt-names property.
- interrupt-names: Must include the following entries:
	- "msi": The interrupt that is asserted when an MSI is received
- clock-names: Must include the following additional entries:
	- "pcie_phy"

Optional properties:
- fsl,tx-deemph-gen1: Gen1 De-emphasis value. Default: 0
- fsl,tx-deemph-gen2-3p5db: Gen2 (3.5db) De-emphasis value. Default: 0
- fsl,tx-deemph-gen2-6db: Gen2 (6db) De-emphasis value. Default: 20
- fsl,tx-swing-full: Gen2 TX SWING FULL value. Default: 127
- fsl,tx-swing-low: TX launch amplitude swing_low value. Default: 127
- fsl,max-link-speed: Specify PCI gen for link capability. Must be '2' for
  gen2, otherwise will default to gen1. Note that the IMX6 LVDS clock outputs
  do not meet gen2 jitter requirements and thus for gen2 capability a gen2
  compliant clock generator should be used and configured.
- reset-gpio: Should specify the GPIO for controlling the PCI bus device reset
  signal. It's not polarity aware and defaults to active-low reset sequence
  (L=reset state, H=operation state).
- reset-gpio-active-high: If present then the reset sequence using the GPIO
  specified in the "reset-gpio" property is reversed (H=reset state,
  L=operation state).
- vpcie-supply: Should specify the regulator in charge of PCIe port power.
  The regulator will be enabled when initializing the PCIe host and
  disabled either as part of the init process or when shutting down the
  host.
- vph-supply: Should specify the regulator in charge of VPH one of the three
  PCIe PHY powers. This regulator can be supplied by both 1.8v and 3.3v voltage
  supplies.

Additional required properties for imx6sx-pcie:
- clock names: Must include the following additional entries:
	- "pcie_inbound_axi"
- power-domains: Must be set to phandles pointing to the DISPLAY and
  PCIE_PHY power domains
- power-domain-names: Must be "pcie", "pcie_phy"

Additional required properties for imx7d-pcie and imx8mq-pcie:
- power-domains: Must be set to a phandle pointing to PCIE_PHY power domain
- resets: Must contain phandles to PCIe-related reset lines exposed by SRC
  IP block
- reset-names: Must contain the following entries:
	       - "pciephy"
	       - "apps"
	       - "turnoff"
- fsl,imx7d-pcie-phy: A phandle to an fsl,imx7d-pcie-phy node.

Additional required properties for imx8mq-pcie:
- clock-names: Must include the following additional entries:
	- "pcie_aux"

		compatible = "fsl,imx6q-pcie", "snps,dw-pcie";

* Freescale i.MX7d PCIe PHY

This is the PHY associated with the IMX7d PCIe controller.  It's used by the
PCI-e controller via the fsl,imx7d-pcie-phy phandle.

Required properties:
- compatible:
	- "fsl,imx7d-pcie-phy"
- reg: base address and length of the PCIe PHY controller
