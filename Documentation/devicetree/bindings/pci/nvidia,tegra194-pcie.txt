NVIDIA Tegra PCIe controller (Synopsys DesignWare Core based)

This PCIe controller is based on the Synopsis Designware PCIe IP
and thus inherits all the common properties defined in snps,dw-pcie.yaml and
snps,dw-pcie-ep.yaml.
Some of the controller instances are dual mode where in they can work either
in root port mode or endpoint mode but one at a time.

Required properties:
- power-domains: A phandle to the node that controls power to the respective
  PCIe controller and a specifier name for the PCIe controller. Following are
  the specifiers for the different PCIe controllers
    TEGRA194_POWER_DOMAIN_PCIEX8B: C0
    TEGRA194_POWER_DOMAIN_PCIEX1A: C1
    TEGRA194_POWER_DOMAIN_PCIEX1A: C2
    TEGRA194_POWER_DOMAIN_PCIEX1A: C3
    TEGRA194_POWER_DOMAIN_PCIEX4A: C4
    TEGRA194_POWER_DOMAIN_PCIEX8A: C5
  these specifiers are defined in
  "include/dt-bindings/power/tegra194-powergate.h" file.
- reg: A list of physical base address and length pairs for each set of
  controller registers. Must contain an entry for each entry in the reg-names
  property.
- reg-names: Must include the following entries:
  "appl": Controller's application logic registers
  "config": As per the definition in snps,dw-pcie.yaml
  "atu_dma": iATU and DMA registers. This is where the iATU (internal Address
             Translation Unit) registers of the PCIe core are made available
             for SW access.
  "dbi": The aperture where root port's own configuration registers are
         available
- interrupts: A list of interrupt outputs of the controller. Must contain an
  entry for each entry in the interrupt-names property.
- interrupt-names: Must include the following entries:
  "intr": The Tegra interrupt that is asserted for controller interrupts
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  - core
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  - apb
  - core
- phys: Must contain a phandle to P2U PHY for each entry in phy-names.
- phy-names: Must include an entry for each active lane.
  "p2u-N": where N ranges from 0 to one less than the total number of lanes
- nvidia,bpmp: Must contain a pair of phandle to BPMP controller node followed
  by controller-id. Following are the controller ids for each controller.
    0: C0
    1: C1
    2: C2
    3: C3
    4: C4
    5: C5
- vddio-pex-ctl-supply: Regulator supply for PCIe side band signals

RC mode:
- compatible: Tegra19x must contain  "nvidia,tegra194-pcie"
- device_type: Must be "pci" for RC mode
- interrupt-names: Must include the following entries:
  "msi": The Tegra interrupt that is asserted when an MSI is received
- bus-range: Range of bus numbers associated with this controller
- #address-cells: Address representation for root ports (must be 3)
  - cell 0 specifies the bus and device numbers of the root port:
    [23:16]: bus number
    [15:11]: device number
  - cell 1 denotes the upper 32 address bits and should be 0
  - cell 2 contains the lower 32 address bits and is used to translate to the
    CPU address space
- #size-cells: Size representation for root ports (must be 2)
- ranges: Describes the translation of addresses for root ports and standard
  PCI regions. The entries must be 7 cells each, where the first three cells
  correspond to the address as described for the #address-cells property
  above, the fourth and fifth cells are for the physical CPU address to
  translate to and the sixth and seventh cells are as described for the
  #size-cells property above.
  - Entries setup the mapping for the standard I/O, memory and
    prefetchable PCI regions. The first cell determines the type of region
    that is setup:
    - 0x81000000: I/O memory region
    - 0x82000000: non-prefetchable memory region
    - 0xc2000000: prefetchable memory region
  Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more detailed
  explanation.
- #interrupt-cells: Size representation for interrupts (must be 1)
- interrupt-map-mask and interrupt-map: Standard PCI IRQ mapping properties
  Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more detailed
  explanation.

EP mode:
In Tegra194, Only controllers C0, C4 & C5 support EP mode.
- compatible: Tegra19x must contain "nvidia,tegra194-pcie-ep"
- reg-names: Must include the following entries:
  "addr_space": Used to map remote RC address space
- reset-gpios: Must contain a phandle to a GPIO controller followed by
  GPIO that is being used as PERST input signal. Please refer to pci.txt
  document.

Optional properties:
- pinctrl-names: A list of pinctrl state names.
  It is mandatory for C5 controller and optional for other controllers.
  - "default": Configures PCIe I/O for proper operation.
- pinctrl-0: phandle for the 'default' state of pin configuration.
  It is mandatory for C5 controller and optional for other controllers.
- supports-clkreq: Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/pci.txt
- nvidia,update-fc-fixup: This is a boolean property and needs to be present to
    improve performance when a platform is designed in such a way that it
    satisfies at least one of the following conditions thereby enabling root
    port to exchange optimum number of FC (Flow Control) credits with
    downstream devices
    1. If C0/C4/C5 run at x1/x2 link widths (irrespective of speed and MPS)
    2. If C0/C1/C2/C3/C4/C5 operate at their respective max link widths and
       a) speed is Gen-2 and MPS is 256B
       b) speed is >= Gen-3 with any MPS
- nvidia,aspm-cmrt-us: Common Mode Restore Time for proper operation of ASPM
   to be specified in microseconds
- nvidia,aspm-pwr-on-t-us: Power On time for proper operation of ASPM to be
   specified in microseconds
- nvidia,aspm-l0s-entrance-latency-us: ASPM L0s entrance latency to be
   specified in microseconds

RC mode:
- vpcie3v3-supply: A phandle to the regulator node that supplies 3.3V to the slot
  if the platform has one such slot. (Ex:- x16 slot owned by C5 controller
  in p2972-0000 platform).
- vpcie12v-supply: A phandle to the regulator node that supplies 12V to the slot
  if the platform has one such slot. (Ex:- x16 slot owned by C5 controller
  in p2972-0000 platform).

EP mode:
- nvidia,refclk-select-gpios: Must contain a phandle to a GPIO controller
  followed by GPIO that is being used to enable REFCLK to controller from host

NOTE:- On Tegra194's P2972-0000 platform, only C5 controller can be enabled to
operate in the endpoint mode because of the way the platform is designed.
