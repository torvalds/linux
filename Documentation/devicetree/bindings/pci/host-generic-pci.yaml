description: |
  Firmware-initialised PCI host controllers and PCI emulations, such as the
  virtio-pci implementations found in kvmtool and other para-virtualised
  systems, do not require driver support for complexities such as regulator
  and clock management. In fact, the controller may not even require the
  configuration of a control interface by the operating system, instead
  presenting a set of fixed windows describing a subset of IO, Memory and
  Configuration Spaces.

  Configuration Space is assumed to be memory-mapped (as opposed to being
  accessed via an ioport) and laid out with a direct correspondence to the
  geography of a PCI bus address by concatenating the various components to
  form an offset.

  For CAM, this 24-bit offset is:

          cfg_offset(bus, device, function, register) =
                     bus << 16 | device << 11 | function << 8 | register

  While ECAM extends this by 4 bits to accommodate 4k of function space:

          cfg_offset(bus, device, function, register) =
                     bus << 20 | device << 15 | function << 12 | register

          ThunderX PCI host controller for pass-1.x silicon

          Firmware-initialized PCI host controller to on-chip devices found on
          some Cavium ThunderX processors.  These devices have ECAM-based config
          access, but the BARs are all at fixed addresses.  We handle the fixed
          addresses by synthesizing Enhanced Allocation (EA) capabilities for
          these devices.

          In some cases, firmware may already have configured the Synopsys
          DesignWare PCIe controller in RC mode with static ATU window mappings
          that cover all config, MMIO and I/O spaces in a [mostly] ECAM
          compatible fashion. In this case, there is no need for the OS to
          perform any low level setup of clocks, PHYs or device registers, nor
          is there any reason for the driver to reconfigure ATU windows for
          config and/or IO space accesses at runtime.

          In cases where the IP was synthesized with a minimum ATU window size
          of 64 KB, it cannot be supported by the generic ECAM driver, because
          it requires special config space accessors that filter accesses to
          device #1 and beyond on the first bus.
