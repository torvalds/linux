*Interrupt controller child node*
The core controller provides a single interrupt for legacy INTx. The PCIe node
should contain an interrupt controller node as a target for the PCI
'interrupt-map' property. This node represents the domain at which the four
INTx interrupts are decoded and routed.


Required properties for Interrupt controller child node:
- interrupt-controller: identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #address-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
	address. The value must be 0.
- #interrupt-cells: specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
	interrupt source. The value must be 1.
