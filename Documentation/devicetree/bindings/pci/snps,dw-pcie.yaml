            Basic DWC PCIe controller configuration-space accessible over

            CDM/ELBI = 0 and CS2 = 0 or is a contiguous memory region
            with all spaces. Note iATU/eDMA CSRs are indirectly accessible

            the PCI-SIG PCIe CFG-space with the shadow registers for some
            PCI Header space, PCI Standard and Extended Structures. It's
            mainly relevant for the end-point controller configuration,

            Root Port mode too.

            and CS2 = 1. For IP-core releases prior v4.80a, these registers
            have been programmed via an indirect addressing scheme using a
            set of viewport CSRs mapped into the PL space. Note iATU is
            normally mapped to the 0x0 address of this region, while eDMA
