            Basic DWC PCIe controller configuration-space accessible over
            the DBI interface. This memory space is either activated with
            CDM/ELBI = 0 and CS2 = 0 or is a contiguous memory region
            with all spaces. Note iATU/eDMA CSRs are indirectly accessible
            via the PL viewports on the DWC PCIe controllers older than
            v4.80a.
          const: dbi
        - description:
            Shadow DWC PCIe config-space registers. This space is selected
            by setting CDM/ELBI = 0 and CS2 = 1. This is an intermix of
            the PCI-SIG PCIe CFG-space with the shadow registers for some
            PCI Header space, PCI Standard and Extended Structures. It's
            mainly relevant for the end-point controller configuration,
            but still there are some shadow registers available for the
            Root Port mode too.
          const: dbi2
        - description:
            External Local Bus registers. It's an application-dependent
            registers normally defined by the platform engineers. The space
            can be selected by setting CDM/ELBI = 1 and CS2 = 0 wires or can
            be accessed over some platform-specific means (for instance
            as a part of a system controller).

            iATU/eDMA registers common for all device functions. It's an
            unrolled memory space with the internal Address Translation
            Unit and Enhanced DMA, which is selected by setting CDM/ELBI = 1
            and CS2 = 1. For IP-core releases prior v4.80a, these registers
            have been programmed via an indirect addressing scheme using a
            set of viewport CSRs mapped into the PL space. Note iATU is
            normally mapped to the 0x0 address of this region, while eDMA
            is available at 0x80000 base address.

            Platform-specific eDMA registers. Some platforms may have eDMA
            CSRs mapped in a non-standard base address. The registers offset
            can be changed or the MS/LS-bits of the address can be attached
            in an additional RTL block before the MEM-IO transactions reach
            the DW PCIe slave interface.

            PHY/PCS configuration registers. Some platforms can have the
            PCS and PHY CSRs accessible over a dedicated memory mapped
            region, but mainly these registers are indirectly accessible
            either by means of the embedded PHY viewport schema or by some
            platform-specific method.

            generate various application-specific traffic on the PCIe bus
            hierarchy. It's usage scenario depends on the endpoint

            messages.
