title: Samsung SoC PWM timers

description: |+
  Samsung SoCs contain PWM timer blocks which can be used for system clock source
  and clock event timers, as well as to drive SoC outputs with PWM signal. Each
  PWM timer block provides 5 PWM channels (not all of them can drive physical
  outputs - see SoC and board manual).

  Be aware that the clocksource driver supports only uniprocessor systems.

  clock-names:
    description: |
      Should contain all following required clock names:
      - "timers" - PWM base clock used to generate PWM signals,
      and any subset of following optional clock names:
      - "pwm-tclk0" - first external PWM clock source,
      - "pwm-tclk1" - second external PWM clock source.
      Note that not all IP variants allow using all external clock sources.
      Refer to SoC documentation to learn which clock source configurations
      are available.

      A list of PWM channels used as PWM outputs on particular platform.
