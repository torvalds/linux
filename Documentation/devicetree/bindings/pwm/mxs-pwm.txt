Freescale MXS PWM controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "fsl,imx23-pwm"
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- #pwm-cells: should be 2.  The first cell specifies the per-chip index
  of the PWM to use and the second cell is the duty cycle in nanoseconds.
- fsl,pwm-number: the number of PWM devices

Example:

pwm: pwm@80064000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx28-pwm", "fsl,imx23-pwm";
	reg = <0x80064000 2000>;
	#pwm-cells = <2>;
	fsl,pwm-number = <8>;
};
