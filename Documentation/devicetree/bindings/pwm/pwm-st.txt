STMicroelectronics PWM driver bindings
--------------------------------------

Required parameters:
- compatible :		"st,pwm"
- #pwm-cells : 		Number of cells used to specify a PWM. First cell
			specifies the per-chip index of the PWM to use and the
			second cell is the period in nanoseconds - fixed to 2
			for STiH41x.
- reg :			Physical base address and length of the controller's
			registers.
- pinctrl-names: 	Set to "default".
- pinctrl-0: 		List of phandles pointing to pin configuration nodes
			for PWM module.
			For Pinctrl properties, please refer to [1].
- clock-names: 		Set to "pwm".
- clocks: 		phandle of the clock used by the PWM module.
			For Clk properties, please refer to [2].

Optional properties:
- st,pwm-num-chan:	Number of available channels. If not passed, the driver
			will consider single channel by default.

Example:

pwm1: pwm@fe510000 {
	compatible = "st,pwm";
	reg = <0xfe510000 0x68>;
	#pwm-cells = <2>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_pwm1_chan0_default
		     &pinctrl_pwm1_chan1_default
		     &pinctrl_pwm1_chan2_default
		     &pinctrl_pwm1_chan3_default>;
	clocks = <&clk_sysin>;
	clock-names = "pwm";
	st,pwm-num-chan = <4>;
};
