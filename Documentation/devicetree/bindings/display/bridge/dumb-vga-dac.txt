Dumb RGB to VGA DAC bridge
---------------------------

This binding is aimed for dumb RGB to VGA DAC based bridges that do not require
any configuration.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "dumb-vga-dac"

Required nodes:

This device has two video ports. Their connections are modelled using the OF
graph bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

- Video port 0 for RGB input
- Video port 1 for VGA output

Optional properties:
- vdd-supply: Power supply for DAC

Example
-------

bridge {
	compatible = "dumb-vga-dac";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;

			vga_bridge_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&tcon0_out_vga>;
			};
		};

		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;

			vga_bridge_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&vga_con_in>;
			};
		};
	};
};
