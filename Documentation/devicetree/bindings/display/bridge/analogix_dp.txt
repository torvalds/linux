Analogix Display Port bridge bindings

Required properties for dp-controller:
	-compatible:
		platform specific such as:
		 * "samsung,exynos5-dp"
		 * "rockchip,rk3288-dp"
		 * "rockchip,rk3399-edp"
	-reg:
		physical base address of the controller and length
		of memory mapped region.
	-interrupts:
		interrupt combiner values.
	-clocks:
		from common clock binding: handle to dp clock.
	-clock-names:
		from common clock binding: Shall be "dp".
	-interrupt-parent:
		phandle to Interrupt combiner node.
	-phys:
		from general PHY binding: the phandle for the PHY device.
	-phy-names:
		from general PHY binding: Should be "dp".

Optional properties for dp-controller:
	-analogix,video-bist-enable:
		Enable video bist pattern for DP_TX debugging.
	-force-hpd:
		Indicate driver need force hpd when hpd detect failed, this
		is used for some eDP screen which don't have hpd signal.
	-hpd-gpios:
		Hotplug detect GPIO.
		Indicates which GPIO should be used for hotplug detection
	-port@[X]: SoC specific port nodes with endpoint definitions as defined
		in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt,
		please refer to the SoC specific binding document:
		* Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/exynos/exynos_dp.txt
		* Documentation/devicetree/bindings/video/analogix_dp-rockchip.txt

		reg = <0x145b0000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <10 3>;
		interrupt-parent = <&combiner>;
		clocks = <&clock 342>;
		clock-names = "dp";

		phys = <&dp_phy>;
		phy-names = "dp";
	};
