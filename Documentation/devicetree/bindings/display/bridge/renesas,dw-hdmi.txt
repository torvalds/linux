Renesas Gen3 DWC HDMI TX Encoder
================================

The HDMI transmitter is a Synopsys DesignWare HDMI 1.4 TX controller IP
with a companion PHY IP.

These DT bindings follow the Synopsys DWC HDMI TX bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/bridge/dw_hdmi.txt with the
following device-specific properties.


Required properties:

- compatible : Shall contain one or more of
  - "renesas,r8a774a1-hdmi" for R8A774A1 (RZ/G2M) compatible HDMI TX
  - "renesas,r8a7795-hdmi" for R8A7795 (R-Car H3) compatible HDMI TX
  - "renesas,r8a7796-hdmi" for R8A7796 (R-Car M3-W) compatible HDMI TX
  - "renesas,r8a77965-hdmi" for R8A77965 (R-Car M3-N) compatible HDMI TX
  - "renesas,rcar-gen3-hdmi" for the generic R-Car Gen3 and RZ/G2 compatible
			     HDMI TX

    When compatible with generic versions, nodes must list the SoC-specific
    version corresponding to the platform first, followed by the
    family-specific version.

- reg: See dw_hdmi.txt.
- interrupts: HDMI interrupt number
- clocks: See dw_hdmi.txt.
- clock-names: Shall contain "iahb" and "isfr" as defined in dw_hdmi.txt.
- ports: See dw_hdmi.txt. The DWC HDMI shall have one port numbered 0
  corresponding to the video input of the controller and one port numbered 1
  corresponding to its HDMI output, and one port numbered 2 corresponding to
  sound input of the controller. Each port shall have a single endpoint.

Optional properties:

- power-domains: Shall reference the power domain that contains the DWC HDMI,
  if any.


Example:

	hdmi0: hdmi@fead0000 {
		compatible = "renesas,r8a7795-dw-hdmi";
		reg = <0 0xfead0000 0 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <0 389 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_CORE R8A7795_CLK_S0D4>, <&cpg CPG_MOD 729>;
		clock-names = "iahb", "isfr";
		power-domains = <&sysc R8A7795_PD_ALWAYS_ON>;

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				dw_hdmi0_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&du_out_hdmi0>;
				};
			};
			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				rcar_dw_hdmi0_out: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&hdmi0_con>;
				};
			};
			port@2 {
				reg = <2>;
				rcar_dw_hdmi0_sound_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&hdmi_sound_out>;
				};
			};
		};
	};

	hdmi0-out {
		compatible = "hdmi-connector";
		label = "HDMI0 OUT";
		type = "a";

		port {
			hdmi0_con: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&rcar_dw_hdmi0_out>;
			};
		};
	};
