TFP410 DPI to DVI encoder
=========================

Required properties:
- compatible: "ti,tfp410"

Optional properties:
- powerdown-gpios: power-down gpio
- reg: I2C address. If and only if present the device node should be placed
  into the I2C controller node where the TFP410 I2C is connected to.
- ti,deskew: data de-skew in 350ps increments, from -4 to +3, as configured
  through th DK[3:1] pins. This property shall be present only if the TFP410
  is not connected through I2C.

Required nodes:

This device has two video ports. Their connections are modeled using the OF
graph bindings specified in [1]. Each port node shall have a single endpoint.

- Port 0 is the DPI input port. Its endpoint subnode shall contain a
  pclk-sample property and a remote-endpoint property as specified in [1].

- Port 1 is the DVI output port. Its endpoint subnode shall contain a
  remote-endpoint property is specified in [1].

Example
-------

tfp410: encoder@0 {
	compatible = "ti,tfp410";
	powerdown-gpios = <&twl_gpio 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	ti,deskew = <4>;

	ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;

			tfp410_in: endpoint@0 {
				pclk-sample = <1>;
				remote-endpoint = <&dpi_out>;
			};
		};

		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;

			tfp410_out: endpoint@0 {
				remote-endpoint = <&dvi_connector_in>;
			};
		};
	};
};
