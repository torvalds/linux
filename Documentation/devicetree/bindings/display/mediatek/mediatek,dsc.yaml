description: |
  The DSC standard is a specification of the algorithms used for
  compressing and decompressing image display streams, including
  the specification of the syntax and semantics of the compressed
  video bit stream. DSC is designed for real-time systems with
  real-time compression, transmission, decompression and Display.

  mediatek,gce-client-reg:
    description:
      The register of client driver can be configured by gce with 4 arguments
      defined in this property, such as phandle of gce, subsys id,
      register offset and size.
      Each subsys id is mapping to a base address of display function blocks
      register which is defined in the gce header
      include/dt-bindings/gce/<chip>-gce.h.
