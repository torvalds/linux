description: |
  Mediatek display merge, namely MERGE, is used to merge two slice-per-line
  inputs into one side-by-side output.
  MERGE device node must be siblings to the central MMSYS_CONFIG node.
  For a description of the MMSYS_CONFIG binding, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/mediatek/mediatek,mmsys.yaml
  for details.

    description:
      The setting of merge fifo is mainly provided for the display latency
      buffer to ensure that the back-end panel display data will not be
      underrun, a little more data is needed in the fifo.
      According to the merge fifo settings, when the water level is detected
      to be insufficient, it will trigger RDMA sending ultra and preulra
      command to SMI to speed up the data rate.
