    description:
      A 0.9V supply that powers up the SoC internal circuitry. The actual pin name
      varies between the different SoCs and is usually HDMI_TX_AVDD_0V9 or sometimes
      HDMI_AVDD_1V0.

      to a system I2C master this property contains a phandle to that I2C
      master controller.
