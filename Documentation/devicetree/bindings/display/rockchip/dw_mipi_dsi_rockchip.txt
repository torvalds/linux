Rockchip specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware MIPI DSI
================================

Required properties:
- #address-cells: Should be <1>.
- #size-cells: Should be <0>.
- compatible: one of
	"rockchip,px30-mipi-dsi", "snps,dw-mipi-dsi"
	"rockchip,rk3288-mipi-dsi", "snps,dw-mipi-dsi"
	"rockchip,rk3399-mipi-dsi", "snps,dw-mipi-dsi"
- reg: Represent the physical address range of the controller.
- interrupts: Represent the controller's interrupt to the CPU(s).
- clocks, clock-names: Phandles to the controller's pll reference
  clock(ref) when using an internal dphy and APB clock(pclk).
  For RK3399, a phy config clock (phy_cfg) and a grf clock(grf)
  are required. As described in [1].
- rockchip,grf: this soc should set GRF regs to mux vopl/vopb.
- ports: contain a port node with endpoint definitions as defined in [2].
  For vopb,set the reg = <0> and set the reg = <1> for vopl.
- video port 0 for the VOP input, the remote endpoint maybe vopb or vopl
- video port 1 for either a panel or subsequent encoder

Optional properties:
- phys: from general PHY binding: the phandle for the PHY device.
- phy-names: Should be "dphy" if phys references an external phy.
- #phy-cells: Defined when used as ISP phy, should be 0.
- power-domains: a phandle to mipi dsi power domain node.
- resets: list of phandle + reset specifier pairs, as described in [3].
- reset-names: string reset name, must be "apb".
