Qualcomm Technologies Inc. adreno/snapdragon DSI output

DSI Controller:
Required properties:
- compatible:
  * "qcom,mdss-dsi-ctrl"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers of controller
- reg-names: The names of register regions. The following regions are required:
  * "dsi_ctrl"
- qcom,dsi-host-index: The ID of DSI controller hardware instance. This should
  be 0 or 1, since we have 2 DSI controllers at most for now.
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the DSI block.
- power-domains: Should be <&mmcc MDSS_GDSC>.
- clocks: Phandles to device clocks.
- clock-names: the following clocks are required:
  * "mdp_core"
  * "iface"
  * "bus"
  * "core_mmss"
  * "byte"
  * "pixel"
  * "core"
  For DSIv2, we need an additional clock:
   * "src"
- assigned-clocks: Parents of "byte" and "pixel" for the given platform.
- assigned-clock-parents: The Byte clock and Pixel clock PLL outputs provided
  by a DSI PHY block. See [1] for details on clock bindings.
- vdd-supply: phandle to vdd regulator device node
- vddio-supply: phandle to vdd-io regulator device node
- vdda-supply: phandle to vdda regulator device node
- phys: phandle to DSI PHY device node
- phy-names: the name of the corresponding PHY device
- syscon-sfpb: A phandle to mmss_sfpb syscon node (only for DSIv2)
- ports: Contains 2 DSI controller ports as child nodes. Each port contains
  an endpoint subnode as defined in [2] and [3].

Optional properties:
- panel@0: Node of panel connected to this DSI controller.
  See files in [4] for each supported panel.
- qcom,dual-dsi-mode: Boolean value indicating if the DSI controller is
  driving a panel which needs 2 DSI links.
- qcom,master-dsi: Boolean value indicating if the DSI controller is driving
  the master link of the 2-DSI panel.
- qcom,sync-dual-dsi: Boolean value indicating if the DSI controller is
  driving a 2-DSI panel whose 2 links need receive command simultaneously.
- interrupt-parent: phandle to the MDP block if the interrupt signal is routed
  through MDP block
- pinctrl-names: the pin control state names; should contain "default"
- pinctrl-0: the default pinctrl state (active)
- pinctrl-n: the "sleep" pinctrl state
- ports: contains DSI controller input and output ports as children, each
  containing one endpoint subnode.

  DSI Endpoint properties:
  - remote-endpoint: For port@0, set to phandle of the connected panel/bridge's
    input endpoint. For port@1, set to the MDP interface output. See [2] for
    device graph info.

  - data-lanes: this describes how the physical DSI data lanes are mapped
    to the logical lanes on the given platform. The value contained in
    index n describes what physical lane is mapped to the logical lane n
    (DATAn, where n lies between 0 and 3). The clock lane position is fixed
    and can't be changed. Hence, they aren't a part of the DT bindings. See
    [3] for more info on the data-lanes property.

    For example:

    data-lanes = <3 0 1 2>;

    The above mapping describes that the logical data lane DATA0 is mapped to
    the physical data lane DATA3, logical DATA1 to physical DATA0, logic DATA2
    to phys DATA1 and logic DATA3 to phys DATA2.

    There are only a limited number of physical to logical mappings possible:
    <0 1 2 3>
    <1 2 3 0>
    <2 3 0 1>
    <3 0 1 2>
    <0 3 2 1>
    <1 0 3 2>
    <2 1 0 3>
    <3 2 1 0>

DSI PHY:
Required properties:
- compatible: Could be the following
  * "qcom,dsi-phy-28nm-hpm"
  * "qcom,dsi-phy-28nm-lp"
  * "qcom,dsi-phy-20nm"
  * "qcom,dsi-phy-28nm-8960"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers of PLL, PHY and PHY
  regulator
- reg-names: The names of register regions. The following regions are required:
  * "dsi_pll"
  * "dsi_phy"
  * "dsi_phy_regulator"
- clock-cells: Must be 1. The DSI PHY block acts as a clock provider, creating
  2 clocks: A byte clock (index 0), and a pixel clock (index 1).
- qcom,dsi-phy-index: The ID of DSI PHY hardware instance. This should
  be 0 or 1, since we have 2 DSI PHYs at most for now.
- power-domains: Should be <&mmcc MDSS_GDSC>.
- clocks: Phandles to device clocks. See [1] for details on clock bindings.
- clock-names: the following clocks are required:
  * "iface"
- vddio-supply: phandle to vdd-io regulator device node

Optional properties:
- qcom,dsi-phy-regulator-ldo-mode: Boolean value indicating if the LDO mode PHY
  regulator is wanted.
