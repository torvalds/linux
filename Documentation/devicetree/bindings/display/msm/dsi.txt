Qualcomm Technologies Inc. adreno/snapdragon DSI output

DSI Controller:
Required properties:
- compatible:
  * "qcom,mdss-dsi-ctrl"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers of controller
- reg-names: The names of register regions. The following regions are required:
  * "dsi_ctrl"
- qcom,dsi-host-index: The ID of DSI controller hardware instance. This should
  be 0 or 1, since we have 2 DSI controllers at most for now.
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the DSI block.
- power-domains: Should be <&mmcc MDSS_GDSC>.
- clocks: device clocks
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: the following clocks are required:
  * "mdp_core_clk"
  * "iface_clk"
  * "bus_clk"
  * "core_mmss_clk"
  * "byte_clk"
  * "pixel_clk"
  * "core_clk"
  For DSIv2, we need an additional clock:
   * "src_clk"
- vdd-supply: phandle to vdd regulator device node
- vddio-supply: phandle to vdd-io regulator device node
- vdda-supply: phandle to vdda regulator device node
- qcom,dsi-phy: phandle to DSI PHY device node
- syscon-sfpb: A phandle to mmss_sfpb syscon node (only for DSIv2)

Optional properties:
- panel@0: Node of panel connected to this DSI controller.
  See files in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/ for each supported
  panel.
- qcom,dual-dsi-mode: Boolean value indicating if the DSI controller is
  driving a panel which needs 2 DSI links.
- qcom,master-dsi: Boolean value indicating if the DSI controller is driving
  the master link of the 2-DSI panel.
- qcom,sync-dual-dsi: Boolean value indicating if the DSI controller is
  driving a 2-DSI panel whose 2 links need receive command simultaneously.
- interrupt-parent: phandle to the MDP block if the interrupt signal is routed
  through MDP block
- pinctrl-names: the pin control state names; should contain "default"
- pinctrl-0: the default pinctrl state (active)
- pinctrl-n: the "sleep" pinctrl state
- port: DSI controller output port, containing one endpoint subnode.

  DSI Endpoint properties:
  - remote-endpoint: set to phandle of the connected panel's endpoint.
    See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt for device graph info.
  - data-lanes: this describes how the physical DSI data lanes are mapped
    to the logical lanes on the given platform. The value contained in
    index n describes what physical lane is mapped to the logical lane n
    (DATAn, where n lies between 0 and 3). The clock lane position is fixed
    and can't be changed. Hence, they aren't a part of the DT bindings. For
    more info, see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt

    For example:

    data-lanes = <3 0 1 2>;

    The above mapping describes that the logical data lane DATA0 is mapped to
    the physical data lane DATA3, logical DATA1 to physical DATA0, logic DATA2
    to phys DATA1 and logic DATA3 to phys DATA2.

    There are only a limited number of physical to logical mappings possible:
    <0 1 2 3>
    <1 2 3 0>
    <2 3 0 1>
    <3 0 1 2>
    <0 3 2 1>
    <1 0 3 2>
    <2 1 0 3>
    <3 2 1 0>

DSI PHY:
Required properties:
- compatible: Could be the following
  * "qcom,dsi-phy-28nm-hpm"
  * "qcom,dsi-phy-28nm-lp"
  * "qcom,dsi-phy-20nm"
  * "qcom,dsi-phy-28nm-8960"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers of PLL, PHY and PHY
  regulator
- reg-names: The names of register regions. The following regions are required:
  * "dsi_pll"
  * "dsi_phy"
  * "dsi_phy_regulator"
- qcom,dsi-phy-index: The ID of DSI PHY hardware instance. This should
  be 0 or 1, since we have 2 DSI PHYs at most for now.
- power-domains: Should be <&mmcc MDSS_GDSC>.
- clocks: device clocks
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: the following clocks are required:
  * "iface_clk"
- vddio-supply: phandle to vdd-io regulator device node

Optional properties:
- qcom,dsi-phy-regulator-ldo-mode: Boolean value indicating if the LDO mode PHY
  regulator is wanted.
