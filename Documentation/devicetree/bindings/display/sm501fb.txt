* SM SM501

The SM SM501 is a LCD controller, with proper hardware, it can also
drive DVI monitors.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "smi,sm501".
- reg : contain two entries:
    - First entry: System Configuration register
    - Second entry: IO space (Display Controller register)
- interrupts : SMI interrupt to the cpu should be described here.
- interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller that
  services interrupts for this device.

Optional properties:
- mode : select a video mode:
    <xres>x<yres>[-<bpp>][@<refresh>]
- edid : verbatim EDID data block describing attached display.
  Data from the detailed timing descriptor will be used to
  program the display controller.
- little-endian: available on big endian systems, to
  set different foreign endian.
- big-endian: available on little endian systems, to
  set different foreign endian.

Example for MPC5200:
	display@1,0 {
		compatible = "smi,sm501";
		reg = <1 0x00000000 0x00800000
		       1 0x03e00000 0x00200000>;
		interrupts = <1 1 3>;
		mode = "640x480-32@60";
		edid = [edid-data];
	};
