description: |
  This panel requires a dual-channel DSI host to operate. It supports two modes:
  - left-right: each channel drives the left or right half of the screen
  - even-odd: each channel drives the even or odd lines of the screen

  Each of the DSI channels controls a separate DSI peripheral. The peripheral
  driven by the first link (DSI-LINK1), left or even, is considered the primary
  peripheral and controls the device. The 'link2' property contains a phandle
  to the peripheral driven by the second link (DSI-LINK2, right or odd).

  Note that in video mode the DSI-LINK1 interface always provides the left/even
  pixels and DSI-LINK2 always provides the right/odd pixels. In command mode it
  is possible to program either link to drive the left/even or right/odd pixels
  but for the sake of consistency this binding assumes that the same assignment
  is chosen as for video mode.
