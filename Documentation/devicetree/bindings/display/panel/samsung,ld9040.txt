Samsung LD9040 AMOLED LCD parallel RGB panel with SPI control bus

Required properties:
  - compatible: "samsung,ld9040"
  - reg: address of the panel on SPI bus
  - vdd3-supply: core voltage supply
  - vci-supply: voltage supply for analog circuits
  - reset-gpios: a GPIO spec for the reset pin
  - display-timings: timings for the connected panel according to [1]

The panel must obey rules for SPI slave device specified in document [2].

Optional properties:
  - power-on-delay: delay after turning regulators on [ms]
  - reset-delay: delay after reset sequence [ms]
  - panel-width-mm: physical panel width [mm]
  - panel-height-mm: physical panel height [mm]

The device node can contain one 'port' child node with one child
'endpoint' node, according to the bindings defined in [3]. This
node should describe panel's video bus.
