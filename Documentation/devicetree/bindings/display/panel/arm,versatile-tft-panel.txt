ARM Versatile TFT Panels

These panels are connected to the daughterboards found on the
ARM Versatile reference designs.

This device node must appear as a child to a "syscon"-compatible
node.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "arm,versatile-tft-panel"

Required subnodes:
- port: see display/panel/panel-common.txt, graph.txt


Example:

sysreg@0 {
	compatible = "arm,versatile-sysreg", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
	reg = <0x00000 0x1000>;

	panel: display@0 {
		compatible = "arm,versatile-tft-panel";

		port {
			panel_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&foo>;
			};
		};
	};
};
