Allwinner A10 Display Pipeline
==============================

The Allwinner A10 Display pipeline is composed of several components
that are going to be documented below:

For all connections between components up to the TCONs in the display
pipeline, when there are multiple components of the same type at the
same depth, the local endpoint ID must be the same as the remote
component's index. For example, if the remote endpoint is Frontend 1,
then the local endpoint ID must be 1.

    Frontend 0  [0] ------- [0]  Backend 0  [0] ------- [0]  TCON 0
		[1] --   -- [1]             [1] --   -- [1]
		      \ /                         \ /
		       X                           X
		      / \                         / \
		[0] --   -- [0]             [0] --   -- [0]
    Frontend 1  [1] ------- [1]  Backend 1  [1] ------- [1]  TCON 1

For a two pipeline system such as the one depicted above, the lines
represent the connections between the components, while the numbers
within the square brackets corresponds to the ID of the local endpoint.

The same rule also applies to DE 2.0 mixer-TCON connections:

    Mixer 0  [0] ----------- [0]  TCON 0
	     [1] ----   ---- [1]
		     \ /
		      X
		     / \
	     [0] ----   ---- [0]
    Mixer 1  [1] ----------- [1]  TCON 1

the pipeline.

 - reg: base address and size of memory-mapped region
 - clocks: the clocks driving the TV encoder
 - resets: phandle to the reset controller driving the encoder

- ports: A ports node with endpoint definitions as defined in

  first port should be the input endpoint.

TCON
----

The TCON acts as a timing controller for RGB, LVDS and TV interfaces.

Required properties:
 - compatible: value must be either:
   * allwinner,sun4i-a10-tcon
   * allwinner,sun5i-a13-tcon

   * allwinner,sun9i-a80-tcon-tv
   * "allwinner,sun50i-a64-tcon-lcd", "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-tcon-lcd"
   * "allwinner,sun50i-a64-tcon-tv", "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-tcon-tv"
   * allwinner,sun50i-h6-tcon-tv, allwinner,sun8i-r40-tcon-tv
 - reg: base address and size of memory-mapped region
 - interrupts: interrupt associated to this IP
 - clocks: phandles to the clocks feeding the TCON.
   - 'ahb': the interface clocks
   - 'tcon-ch0': The clock driving the TCON channel 0, if supported
 - resets: phandles to the reset controllers driving the encoder
   - "lcd": the reset line for the TCON
   - "edp": the reset line for the eDP block (A80 only)

 - clock-names: the clock names mentioned above
 - reset-names: the reset names mentioned above
 - clock-output-names: Name of the pixel clock created, if TCON supports
   channel 0.

- ports: A ports node with endpoint definitions as defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt. The
  first port should be the input endpoint, the second one the output

  The output may have multiple endpoints. TCON can have 1 or 2 channels,
  usually with the first channel being used for the panels interfaces
  (RGB, LVDS, etc.), and the second being used for the outputs that
  require another controller (TV Encoder, HDMI, etc.). The endpoints
  will take an extra property, allwinner,tcon-channel, to specify the
  channel the endpoint is associated to. If that property is not
  present, the endpoint number will be used as the channel number.

For TCONs with channel 0, there is one more clock required:
   - 'tcon-ch0': The clock driving the TCON channel 0
For TCONs with channel 1, there is one more clock required:
   - 'tcon-ch1': The clock driving the TCON channel 1

When TCON support LVDS (all TCONs except TV TCONs on A83T, R40 and those found
in A13, H3, H5 and V3s SoCs), you need one more reset line:
   - 'lvds': The reset line driving the LVDS logic

And on the A23, A31, A31s and A33, you need one more clock line:
   - 'lvds-alt': An alternative clock source, separate from the TCON channel 0
                 clock, that can be used to drive the LVDS clock

TCON TOP
--------

TCON TOPs main purpose is to configure whole display pipeline. It determines
relationships between mixers and TCONs, selects source TCON for HDMI, muxes
LCD and TV encoder GPIO output, selects TV encoder clock source and contains
additional TV TCON and DSI gates.

It allows display pipeline to be configured in very different ways:

                                / LCD0/LVDS0
                 / [0] TCON-LCD0
                 |              \ MIPI DSI
 mixer0          |
        \        / [1] TCON-LCD1 - LCD1/LVDS1
         TCON-TOP
        /        \ [2] TCON-TV0 [0] - TVE0/RGB
 mixer1          |                  \
                 |                   TCON-TOP - HDMI
                 |                  /
                 \ [3] TCON-TV1 [1] - TVE1/RGB

    * port 2 is input for mixer1 mux
    * port 3 is output for mixer1 mux
    * port 4 is input for HDMI mux
    * port 5 is output for HDMI mux
    All output endpoints for mixer muxes and input endpoints for HDMI mux should
    have reg property with the id of the target TCON, as shown in above graph
    (0-3 for mixer muxes and 0-1 for HDMI mux). All ports should have only one
    endpoint connected to remote endpoint.
