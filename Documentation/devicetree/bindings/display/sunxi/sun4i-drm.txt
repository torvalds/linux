Allwinner A10 Display Pipeline
==============================

The Allwinner A10 Display pipeline is composed of several components
that are going to be documented below:

For all connections between components up to the TCONs in the display
pipeline, when there are multiple components of the same type at the
same depth, the local endpoint ID must be the same as the remote
component's index. For example, if the remote endpoint is Frontend 1,
then the local endpoint ID must be 1.

    Frontend 0  [0] ------- [0]  Backend 0  [0] ------- [0]  TCON 0
		[1] --   -- [1]             [1] --   -- [1]
		      \ /                         \ /
		       X                           X
		      / \                         / \
		[0] --   -- [0]             [0] --   -- [0]
    Frontend 1  [1] ------- [1]  Backend 1  [1] ------- [1]  TCON 1

For a two pipeline system such as the one depicted above, the lines
represent the connections between the components, while the numbers
within the square brackets corresponds to the ID of the local endpoint.

The same rule also applies to DE 2.0 mixer-TCON connections:

    Mixer 0  [0] ----------- [0]  TCON 0
	     [1] ----   ---- [1]
		     \ /
		      X
		     / \
	     [0] ----   ---- [0]
    Mixer 1  [1] ----------- [1]  TCON 1

HDMI Encoder
------------

The HDMI Encoder supports the HDMI video and audio outputs, and does
CEC. It is one end of the pipeline.

Required properties:
  - compatible: value must be one of:
    * allwinner,sun4i-a10-hdmi
    * allwinner,sun5i-a10s-hdmi
  - reg: base address and size of memory-mapped region
  - interrupts: interrupt associated to this IP
  - clocks: phandles to the clocks feeding the HDMI encoder
    * ahb: the HDMI interface clock
    * mod: the HDMI module clock
    * pll-0: the first video PLL
    * pll-1: the second video PLL
  - clock-names: the clock names mentioned above
  - dmas: phandles to the DMA channels used by the HDMI encoder
    * ddc-tx: The channel for DDC transmission
    * ddc-rx: The channel for DDC reception
    * audio-tx: The channel used for audio transmission
  - dma-names: the channel names mentioned above

  - ports: A ports node with endpoint definitions as defined in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt. The
    first port should be the input endpoint. The second should be the
    output, usually to an HDMI connector.

TV Encoder
----------

The TV Encoder supports the composite and VGA output. It is one end of
the pipeline.

Required properties:
 - compatible: value should be "allwinner,sun4i-a10-tv-encoder".
 - reg: base address and size of memory-mapped region
 - clocks: the clocks driving the TV encoder
 - resets: phandle to the reset controller driving the encoder

- ports: A ports node with endpoint definitions as defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt. The
  first port should be the input endpoint.

TCON
----

The TCON acts as a timing controller for RGB, LVDS and TV interfaces.

Required properties:
 - compatible: value must be either:
   * allwinner,sun4i-a10-tcon
   * allwinner,sun5i-a13-tcon
   * allwinner,sun6i-a31-tcon
   * allwinner,sun6i-a31s-tcon
   * allwinner,sun8i-a33-tcon
   * allwinner,sun8i-v3s-tcon
 - reg: base address and size of memory-mapped region
 - interrupts: interrupt associated to this IP
 - clocks: phandles to the clocks feeding the TCON. Three are needed:
   - 'ahb': the interface clocks
   - 'tcon-ch0': The clock driving the TCON channel 0
 - resets: phandles to the reset controllers driving the encoder
   - "lcd": the reset line for the TCON channel 0

 - clock-names: the clock names mentioned above
 - reset-names: the reset names mentioned above
 - clock-output-names: Name of the pixel clock created

- ports: A ports node with endpoint definitions as defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt. The
  first port should be the input endpoint, the second one the output

  The output may have multiple endpoints. The TCON has two channels,
  usually with the first channel being used for the panels interfaces
  (RGB, LVDS, etc.), and the second being used for the outputs that
  require another controller (TV Encoder, HDMI, etc.). The endpoints
  will take an extra property, allwinner,tcon-channel, to specify the
  channel the endpoint is associated to. If that property is not
  present, the endpoint number will be used as the channel number.

On SoCs other than the A33 and V3s, there is one more clock required:
   - 'tcon-ch1': The clock driving the TCON channel 1

DRC
---

The DRC (Dynamic Range Controller), found in the latest Allwinner SoCs

  - interrupts: interrupt associated to this IP
  - clocks: phandles to the clocks feeding the DRC
    * ahb: the DRC interface clock
    * mod: the DRC module clock
    * ram: the DRC DRAM clock
  - clock-names: the clock names mentioned above
  - resets: phandles to the reset line driving the DRC
