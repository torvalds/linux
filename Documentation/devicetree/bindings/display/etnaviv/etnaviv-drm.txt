Etnaviv DRM master device
=========================

The Etnaviv DRM master device is a virtual device needed to list all
Vivante GPU cores that comprise the GPU subsystem.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of
    "fsl,imx-gpu-subsystem"
    "marvell,dove-gpu-subsystem"
- cores: Should contain a list of phandles pointing to Vivante GPU devices

example:

gpu-subsystem {
	compatible = "fsl,imx-gpu-subsystem";
	cores = <&gpu_2d>, <&gpu_3d>;
};


Vivante GPU core devices
========================

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "vivante,gc"
  A more specific compatible is not needed, as the cores contain chip
  identification registers at fixed locations, which provide all the
  necessary information to the driver.
- reg: should be register base and length as documented in the
  datasheet
- interrupts: Should contain the cores interrupt line
- clocks: should contain one clock for entry in clock-names
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
- clock-names:
   - "bus":    AXI/register clock
   - "core":   GPU core clock
   - "shader": Shader clock (only required if GPU has feature PIPE_3D)

Optional properties:
- power-domains: a power domain consumer specifier according to
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt

example:

gpu_3d: gpu@130000 {
	compatible = "vivante,gc";
	reg = <0x00130000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <0 9 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_GPU3D_AXI>,
	         <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_GPU3D_CORE>,
	         <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_GPU3D_SHADER>;
	clock-names = "bus", "core", "shader";
	power-domains = <&gpc 1>;
};
