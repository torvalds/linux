description:
  The Arm Primcell PL010/PL111 is an LCD controller IP, than scans out
  a framebuffer region in system memory, and creates timed signals for
  a variety of LCD panels.

              DEPRECATED. An array of three 32-bit values, defining the way
              CLD[23:0] pads are wired up.
              The first value contains the index of the "CLD" external pin (pad)
              used as R0 (first bit of the red component), the second value for
              green, the third value for blue.
