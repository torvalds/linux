title: i.MX8M DDR Controller

description:
  The DDRC block is integrated in i.MX8M for interfacing with DDR based
  memories.

  It supports switching between different frequencies at runtime but during
  this process RAM itself becomes briefly inaccessible so actual frequency
  switching is implemented by TF-A code which runs from a SRAM area.

  The Linux driver for the DDRC doesn't even map registers (they're included
  for the sake of "describing hardware"), it mostly just exposes firmware
  capabilities through standard Linux mechanism like devfreq and OPP tables.
