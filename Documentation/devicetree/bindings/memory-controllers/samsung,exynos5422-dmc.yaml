  Samsung Exynos5422 SoC frequency and voltage scaling for Dynamic Memory

description: |
  The Samsung Exynos5422 SoC has DMC (Dynamic Memory Controller) to which the
  DRAM memory chips are connected. The driver is to monitor the controller in
  runtime and switch frequency and voltage. To monitor the usage of the
  controller in runtime, the driver uses the PPMU (Platform Performance
  Monitoring Unit), which is able to measure the current load of the memory.
  When 'userspace' governor is used for the driver, an application is able to
  switch the DMC and memory frequency.

      Phandle of the clock register set used by the controller, these registers
      are used for enabling a 'pause' feature and are not exposed by clock
      framework but they must be used in a safe way.  The register offsets are
      in the driver code and specyfic for this SoC type.
