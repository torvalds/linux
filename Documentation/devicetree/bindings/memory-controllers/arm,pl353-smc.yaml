description:
  The PL353 Static Memory Controller is a bus where you can connect two kinds
  of memory interfaces, which are NAND and memory mapped interfaces (such as
  SRAM or NOR).

      The child device node represents the controller connected to the SMC

      mapped controllers such as NOR and SRAM controllers.
