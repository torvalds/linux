* Freescale IOMUX Controller (IOMUXC) for i.MX

The IOMUX Controller (IOMUXC), together with the IOMUX, enables the IC
to share one PAD to several functional blocks. The sharing is done by
multiplexing the PAD input/output signals. For each PAD there are up to
8 muxing options (called ALT modes). Since different modules require
different PAD settings (like pull up, keeper, etc) the IOMUXC controls
also the PAD settings parameters.

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

Freescale IMX pin configuration node is a node of a group of pins which can be
used for a specific device or function. This node represents both mux and config
of the pins in that group. The 'mux' selects the function mode(also named mux
mode) this pin can work on and the 'config' configures various pad settings
such as pull-up, open drain, drive strength, etc.

Required properties for iomux controller:
- compatible: "fsl,<soc>-iomuxc"
  Please refer to each fsl,<soc>-pinctrl.txt binding doc for supported SoCs.

Required properties for pin configuration node:
- fsl,pins: each entry consists of 6 integers and represents the mux and config
  setting for one pin. The first 5 integers <mux_reg conf_reg input_reg mux_val
  input_val> are specified using a PIN_FUNC_ID macro, which can be found in
  imx*-pinfunc.h under device tree source folder. The last integer CONFIG is
  the pad setting value like pull-up on this pin. And that's why fsl,pins entry
  looks like <PIN_FUNC_ID CONFIG> in the example below.

Bits used for CONFIG:
NO_PAD_CTL(1 << 31): indicate this pin does not need config.

SION(1 << 30): Software Input On Field.
Force the selected mux mode input path no matter of MUX_MODE functionality.
By default the input path is determined by functionality of the selected
mux mode (regular).

Other bits are used for PAD setting.
Please refer to each fsl,<soc>-pinctrl,txt binding doc for SoC specific part
of bits definitions.

NOTE:
Some requirements for using fsl,imx-pinctrl binding:
1. We have pin function node defined under iomux controller node to represent
   what pinmux functions this SoC supports.
2. The pin configuration node intends to work on a specific function should
   to be defined under that specific function node.
   The function node's name should represent well about what function
   this group of pins in this pin configuration node are working on.
3. The driver can use the function node's name and pin configuration node's
   name describe the pin function and group hierarchy.
   For example, Linux IMX pinctrl driver takes the function node's name
   as the function name and pin configuration node's name as group name to
   create the map table.
4. Each pin configuration node should have a phandle, devices can set pins
   configurations by referring to the phandle of that pin configuration node.

Examples:
usdhc@0219c000 { /* uSDHC4 */
	non-removable;
	vmmc-supply = <&reg_3p3v>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_usdhc4_1>;
};

iomuxc@020e0000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-iomuxc";
	reg = <0x020e0000 0x4000>;

	/* shared pinctrl settings */
	usdhc4 {
		pinctrl_usdhc4_1: usdhc4grp-1 {
			fsl,pins = <

};
Refer to the IOMUXC controller chapter in imx6q datasheet,
0x17059 means enable hysteresis, 47KOhm Pull Up, 50Mhz speed,
80Ohm driver strength and Fast Slew Rate.
User should refer to each SoC spec to set the correct value.
