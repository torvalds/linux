* Atmel AT91 Pinmux Controller

The AT91 Pinmux Controler, enables the IC
to share one PAD to several functional blocks. The sharing is done by
multiplexing the PAD input/output signals. For each PAD there are up to
8 muxing options (called periph modes). Since different modules require
different PAD settings (like pull up, keeper, etc) the contoller controls
also the PAD settings parameters.

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

Atmel AT91 pin configuration node is a node of a group of pins which can be
used for a specific device or function. This node represents both mux and config
of the pins in that group. The 'pins' selects the function mode(also named pin
mode) this pin can work on and the 'config' configures various pad settings
such as pull-up, multi drive, etc.

Required properties for iomux controller:
- compatible: "atmel,at91rm9200-pinctrl"
- atmel,mux-mask: array of mask (periph per bank) to describe if a pin can be
  configured in this periph mode. All the periph and bank need to be describe.

How to create such array:

Each column will represent the possible peripheral of the pinctrl
Each line will represent a pio bank

Take an example on the 9260
Peripheral: 2 ( A and B)
Bank: 3 (A, B and C)
=>

  /*    A         B     */
  0xffffffff 0xffc00c3b  /* pioA */
  0xffffffff 0x7fff3ccf  /* pioB */
  0xffffffff 0x007fffff  /* pioC */

For each peripheral/bank we will descibe in a u32 if a pin can can be
configured in it by putting 1 to the pin bit (1 << pin)

Let's take the pioA on peripheral B
From the datasheet Table 10-2.

=> 0xffc00c3b

Required properties for pin configuration node:
- atmel,pins: 4 integers array, represents a group of pins mux and config
  setting. The format is atmel,pins = <PIN_BANK PIN_BANK_NUM PERIPH CONFIG>.
  The PERIPH 0 means gpio.

Bits used for CONFIG:
PULL_UP(1 << 0): indicate this pin need a pull up.
MULTIDRIVE(1 << 1): indicate this pin need to be configured as multidrive.

NOTE:
Some requirements for using atmel,at91rm9200-pinctrl binding:
1. We have pin function node defined under at91 controller node to represent
   what pinmux functions this SoC supports.
2. The driver can use the function node's name and pin configuration node's
   name describe the pin function and group hierarchy.
   For example, Linux at91 pinctrl driver takes the function node's name
   as the function name and pin configuration node's name as group name to
   create the map table.
3. Each pin configuration node should have a phandle, devices can set pins
   configurations by referring to the phandle of that pin configuration node.
4. The gpio controller must be describe in the pinctrl simple-bus.

Examples:

pinctrl@fffff400 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges;
	compatible = "atmel,at91rm9200-pinctrl", "simple-bus";
	reg = <0xfffff400 0x600>;

	atmel,mux-mask = <
	      /*    A         B     */
	       0xffffffff 0xffc00c3b  /* pioA */
	       0xffffffff 0x7fff3ccf  /* pioB */
	       0xffffffff 0x007fffff  /* pioC */
	      >;

	/* shared pinctrl settings */
	dbgu {
		pinctrl_dbgu: dbgu-0 {
			atmel,pins =
				<1 14 0x1 0x0	/* PB14 periph A */
				 1 15 0x1 0x1>;	/* PB15 periph with pullup */
		};
	};
};

dbgu: serial@fffff200 {
	compatible = "atmel,at91sam9260-usart";
	reg = <0xfffff200 0x200>;
	interrupts = <1 4 7>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_dbgu>;
	status = "disabled";
};
