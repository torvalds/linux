title: Rockchip Pinmux Controller

description: |
  The Rockchip Pinmux Controller enables the IC to share one PAD
  to several functional blocks. The sharing is done by multiplexing
  the PAD input/output signals. For each PAD there are several muxing
  options with option 0 being used as a GPIO.

  Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
  common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
  phrase "pin configuration node".

  The Rockchip pin configuration node is a node of a group of pins which can be
  used for a specific device or function. This node represents both mux and
  config of the pins in that group. The 'pins' selects the function mode
  (also named pin mode) this pin can work on and the 'config' configures
  various pad settings such as pull-up, etc.

  The pins are grouped into up to 9 individual pin banks which need to be
  defined as gpio sub-nodes of the pinmux controller.

      point to the PMUGRF syscon.
