description:
  Many data items that are represented in a pin configuration node are common
  and generic. Pin control bindings should use the properties defined below
  where they are applicable; not all of these properties are relevant or useful
  for all hardware or binding structures. Each individual binding document
  should state which of these generic properties, if any, are used, and the
  structure of the DT nodes that contain these properties.

      pin. Typically indicates how many double-inverters are
      used to delay the signal.
