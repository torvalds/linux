* Renesas Pin Function Controller (GPIO and Pin Mux/Config)

The Pin Function Controller (PFC) is a Pin Mux/Config controller. On SH7372,
SH73A0, R8A73A4 and R8A7740 it also acts as a GPIO controller.


Pin Control
-----------

Required Properties:

  - compatible: should be one of the following.
    - "renesas,pfc-r8a73a4": for R8A73A4 (R-Mobile APE6) compatible pin-controller.
    - "renesas,pfc-r8a7740": for R8A7740 (R-Mobile A1) compatible pin-controller.
    - "renesas,pfc-r8a7778": for R8A7778 (R-Mobile M1) compatible pin-controller.
    - "renesas,pfc-r8a7779": for R8A7779 (R-Car H1) compatible pin-controller.
    - "renesas,pfc-r8a7790": for R8A7790 (R-Car H2) compatible pin-controller.
    - "renesas,pfc-sh7372": for SH7372 (SH-Mobile AP4) compatible pin-controller.
    - "renesas,pfc-sh73a0": for SH73A0 (SH-Mobile AG5) compatible pin-controller.

  - reg: Base address and length of each memory resource used by the pin
    controller hardware module.

Optional properties:

  - #gpio-range-cells: Mandatory when the PFC doesn't handle GPIO, forbidden
    otherwise. Should be 3.

The PFC node also acts as a container for pin configuration nodes. Please refer
to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for the definition of the term "pin
configuration node" and for the common pinctrl bindings used by client devices.

Each pin configuration node represents desired functions to select on a pin
group or a list of pin groups. The functions and pin groups can be specified
directly in the pin configuration node, or grouped in child subnodes. Several
functions can thus be referenced as a single pin configuration node by client
devices.

A configuration node or subnode must contain a function and reference at least
one pin group.

All pin configuration nodes and subnodes names are ignored. All of those nodes
are parsed through phandles and processed purely based on their content.

Pin Configuration Node Properties:

- renesas,groups : An array of strings, each string containing the name of a pin
  group.

- renesas,function: A string containing the name of the function to mux to the
  pin group(s) specified by the renesas,groups property

  Valid values for pin, group and function names can be found in the group and
  function arrays of the PFC data file corresponding to the SoC
  (drivers/pinctrl/sh-pfc/pfc-*.c)


GPIO
----

On SH7372, SH73A0, R8A73A4 and R8A7740 the PFC node is also a GPIO controller
node.

Required Properties:

  - gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a gpio controller.

  - #gpio-cells: Should be 2. The first cell is the GPIO number and the second
    cell specifies GPIO flags, as defined in <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>. Only the
    GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH and GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flags are supported.

The syntax of the gpio specifier used by client nodes should be the following
with values derived from the SoC user manual.

  <[phandle of the gpio controller node]
   [pin number within the gpio controller]
   [flags]>

On other mach-shmobile platforms GPIO is handled by the gpio-rcar driver.
Please refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/renesas,gpio-rcar.txt
for documentation of the GPIO device tree bindings on those platforms.


Examples
--------

Example 1: SH73A0 (SH-Mobile AG5) pin controller node

	pfc: pfc@e6050000 {
		compatible = "renesas,pfc-sh73a0";
		reg = <0xe6050000 0x8000>,
		      <0xe605801c 0x1c>;
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
	};

Example 2: A GPIO LED node that references a GPIO

	#include <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>

	leds {
		compatible = "gpio-leds";
		led1 {
			gpios = <&pfc 20 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		};
	};

Example 3: KZM-A9-GT (SH-Mobile AG5) default pin state hog and pin control maps
           for the MMCIF and SCIFA4 devices

	&pfc {
		pinctrl-0 = <&scifa4_pins>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";

		mmcif_pins: mmcif {
			renesas,groups = "mmc0_data8_0", "mmc0_ctrl_0";
			renesas,function = "mmc0";
		};

		scifa4_pins: scifa4 {
			renesas,groups = "scifa4_data", "scifa4_ctrl";
			renesas,function = "scifa4";
		};
	};

Example 4: KZM-A9-GT (SH-Mobile AG5) default pin state for the MMCIF device

	&mmcif {
		pinctrl-0 = <&mmcif_pins>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";

		bus-width = <8>;
		vmmc-supply = <&reg_1p8v>;
		status = "okay";
	};
