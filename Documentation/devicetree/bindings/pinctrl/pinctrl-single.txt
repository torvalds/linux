One-register-per-pin type device tree based pinctrl driver

Required properties:
- compatible : "pinctrl-single" or "pinconf-single".
  "pinctrl-single" means that pinconf isn't supported.
  "pinconf-single" means that generic pinconf is supported.

- reg : offset and length of the register set for the mux registers

- pinctrl-single,register-width : pinmux register access width in bits

- pinctrl-single,function-mask : mask of allowed pinmux function bits
  in the pinmux register

Optional properties:
- pinctrl-single,function-off : function off mode for disabled state if
  available and same for all registers; if not specified, disabling of
  pin functions is ignored

- pinctrl-single,bit-per-mux : boolean to indicate that one register controls
  more than one pin, for which "pinctrl-single,function-mask" property specifies
 position mask of pin.

- pinctrl-single,drive-strength : array of value that are used to configure
  drive strength in the pinmux register. They're value of drive strength
  current and drive strength mask.

		/* drive strength current, mask */
		pinctrl-single,power-source = <0x30 0xf0>;

- pinctrl-single,bias-pullup : array of value that are used to configure the
  input bias pullup in the pinmux register.

		/* input, enabled pullup bits, disabled pullup bits, mask */
		pinctrl-single,bias-pullup = <0 1 0 1>;

- pinctrl-single,bias-pulldown : array of value that are used to configure the
  input bias pulldown in the pinmux register.

		/* input, enabled pulldown bits, disabled pulldown bits, mask */
		pinctrl-single,bias-pulldown = <2 2 0 2>;

  * Two bits to control input bias pullup and pulldown: User should use
    pinctrl-single,bias-pullup & pinctrl-single,bias-pulldown. One bit means
    pullup, and the other one bit means pulldown.
  * Three bits to control input bias enable, pullup and pulldown. User should
    use pinctrl-single,bias-pullup & pinctrl-single,bias-pulldown. Input bias
    enable bit should be included in pullup or pulldown bits.
  * Although driver could set PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_DISABLE, there's no property as
    pinctrl-single,bias-disable. Because pinctrl single driver could implement
    it by calling pulldown, pullup disabled.

- pinctrl-single,input-schmitt : array of value that are used to configure
  input schmitt in the pinmux register. In some silicons, there're two input
  schmitt value (rising-edge & falling-edge) in the pinmux register.

		/* input schmitt value, mask */
		pinctrl-single,input-schmitt = <0x30 0x70>;

- pinctrl-single,input-schmitt-enable : array of value that are used to
  configure input schmitt enable or disable in the pinmux register.

		/* input, enable bits, disable bits, mask */
		pinctrl-single,input-schmitt-enable = <0x30 0x40 0 0x70>;

- pinctrl-single,gpio-range : list of value that are used to configure a GPIO
  range. They're value of subnode phandle, pin base in pinctrl device, pin
  number in this range, GPIO function value of this GPIO range.
  The number of parameters is depend on #pinctrl-single,gpio-range-cells
  property.

		/* pin base, nr pins & gpio function */
		pinctrl-single,gpio-range = <&range 0 3 0 &range 3 9 1>;

- interrupt-controller : standard interrupt controller binding if using
  interrupts for wake-up events for example. In this case pinctrl-single
  is set up as a chained interrupt controller and the wake-up interrupts
  can be requested by the drivers using request_irq().

- #interrupt-cells : standard interrupt binding if using interrupts

This driver assumes that there is only one register for each pin (unless the
pinctrl-single,bit-per-mux is set), and uses the common pinctrl bindings as
specified in the pinctrl-bindings.txt document in this directory.

The pin configuration nodes for pinctrl-single are specified as pinctrl
register offset and value pairs using pinctrl-single,pins. Only the bits
specified in pinctrl-single,function-mask are updated. For example, setting
a pin for a device could be done with:

	pinctrl-single,pins = <0xdc 0x118>;

Where 0xdc is the offset from the pinctrl register base address for the
device pinctrl register, and 0x118 contains the desired value of the
pinctrl register. See the device example and static board pins example
below for more information.

In case when one register changes more than one pin's mux the
pinctrl-single,bits need to be used which takes three parameters:

	pinctrl-single,bits = <0xdc 0x18 0xff>;

Where 0xdc is the offset from the pinctrl register base address for the
device pinctrl register, 0x18 is the desired value, and 0xff is the sub mask to
be used when applying this change to the register.


Optional sub-node: In case some pins could be configured as GPIO in the pinmux
register, those pins could be defined as a GPIO range. This sub-node is required
by pinctrl-single,gpio-range property.

Required properties in sub-node:
- #pinctrl-single,gpio-range-cells : the number of parameters after phandle in
  pinctrl-single,gpio-range property.

	range: gpio-range {
		#pinctrl-single,gpio-range-cells = <3>;
	};
