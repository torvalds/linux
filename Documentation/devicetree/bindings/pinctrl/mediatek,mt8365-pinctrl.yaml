          A pinctrl node should contain at least one subnode representing the

          configuration, pullups, drive strength, input enable/disable and input
          schmitt.

              Describe the specific driving setup property.
              For I2C pins, the existing generic driving setup can only support
              2/4/6/8/10/12/14/16mA driving. But in specific driving setup, they
              can support 0.125/0.25/0.5/1mA adjustment. If we enable specific
              driving setup, the existing generic setup will be disabled.
              The specific driving setup is controlled by E1E0EN.
              When E1=0/E0=0, the strength is 0.125mA.
              When E1=0/E0=1, the strength is 0.25mA.
              When E1=1/E0=0, the strength is 0.5mA.
              When E1=1/E0=1, the strength is 1mA.
              EN is used to enable or disable the specific driving setup.
              Valid arguments are described as below:
              0: (E1, E0, EN) = (0, 0, 0)
              1: (E1, E0, EN) = (0, 0, 1)
              2: (E1, E0, EN) = (0, 1, 0)
              3: (E1, E0, EN) = (0, 1, 1)
              4: (E1, E0, EN) = (1, 0, 0)
              5: (E1, E0, EN) = (1, 0, 1)
              6: (E1, E0, EN) = (1, 1, 0)
              7: (E1, E0, EN) = (1, 1, 1)
              So the valid arguments are from 0 to 7.
