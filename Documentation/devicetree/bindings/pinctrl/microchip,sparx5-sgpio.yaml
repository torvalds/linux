description: |
  By using a serial interface, the SIO controller significantly extend
  the number of available GPIOs with a minimum number of additional
  pins on the device. The primary purpose of the SIO controllers is to
  connect control signals from SFP modules and to act as an LED
  controller.

  microchip,sgpio-port-ranges:
    description: This is a sequence of tuples, defining intervals of
      enabled ports in the serial input stream. The enabled ports must
      match the hardware configuration in order for signals to be
      properly written/read to/from the controller holding
      registers. Being tuples, then number of arguments must be
      even. The tuples mast be ordered (low, high) and are
      inclusive.

  bus-frequency:
    description: The sgpio controller frequency (Hz). This dictates
      the serial bitstream speed, which again affects the latency in
      getting control signals back and forth between external shift
      registers. The speed must be no larger than half the system
      clock, and larger than zero.
