  The Aspeed BMC SoCs typically use the Keyboard-Controller-Style (KCS)
  interfaces on the LPC bus for in-band IPMI communication with their host.

      The host CPU LPC IO data and status addresses for the device. For most

      status address may be optionally provided.

      A 2-cell property expressing the LPC SerIRQ number and the interrupt
      level/sense encoding (specified in the standard fashion).

      Note that the generated interrupt is issued from the BMC to the host, and
      thus the target interrupt controller is not captured by the BMC's
      devicetree.
