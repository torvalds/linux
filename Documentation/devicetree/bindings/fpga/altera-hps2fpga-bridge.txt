Altera FPGA/HPS  Bridge Driver

    This driver manages a bridge between a FPGA and a host processor system
    (HPS).  User space can enable/disable the bridge by writing a "1" or a "0",
    respectively, to its enable file under bridge's entry in
    /sys/class/fpga-bridge.  Typically, one disables the bridges before
    reprogramming the FPGA.  Once the FPGA is reprogrammed, the bridges
    are reenabled.

Required properties:

  - compatible : "altr,socfpga-hps2fpga-bridge"
		 "altr,socfpga-lwhps2fpga-bridge"
		 "altr,socfpga-fpga2hps-bridge"

  - clocks : clocks used by this module

Optional properties:
  - label : name that you want this bridge to show up as under
	/sys/class/fpga-bridge.  Default is br<device#> if this is not specified

Example:
	hps_fpgabridge0: fpgabridge@0 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-hps2fpga-bridge";
		label = "hps2fpga";
		clocks = <&l4_main_clk>;
	};

	hps_fpgabridge1: fpgabridge@1 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-lwhps2fpga-bridge";
		label = "lwhps2fpga";
		clocks = <&l4_main_clk>;
	};

	hps_fpgabridge2: fpgabridge@2 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-fpga2hps-bridge";
		label = "fpga2hps";
		clocks = <&l4_main_clk>;
	};
