Altera FPGA To SDRAM Bridge Driver

    This driver manages a bridge between an FPGA and the SDRAM used by an
    host processor system (HPS). The bridge contains a number read ports,
    write ports, and command ports.  Reconfiguring these ports requires
    that no SDRAM transactions occur during reconfiguration.  In other words,
    the code reconfiguring the ports cannot be run out of SDRAM nor can the
    FPGA access the SDRAM during the reconfiguration.  This driver does not
    support reconfiguring the ports.  Typcially, the ports are configured by
    code running out of onchip ram before Linux is started.

    This driver supports enabling and disabling of the configured ports all
    at once, which allows for safe reprogramming of the FPGA from user space,
    provided the new FPGA image uses the same port configuration.
    User space can enable/disable the bridge by writing a "1" or a "0",
    respectively, to its enable file under bridge's entry in
    /sys/class/fpga-bridge. Typically, one disables the bridges before
    reprogramming the FPGA.  Once the FPGA is reprogrammed, the bridges
    are reenabled.

Required properties:

    - compatible : "altr,socfpga-fpga2sdram-bridge"

    - read-ports-mask : Bits 0 to 3 corresponds read ports 0 to 3. A
	bit set to 1 indicates the corresponding read port should be enabled.

    - write-ports-mask : Bits 0 to 3 corresponds write ports 0 to 3. A
	bit set to 1 indicates the corresponding write port should be enabled.

    - cmd-ports-mask : Bits 0 to 5 correspond to command ports 0 to 5. A
	bit set to 1 indicates the corresponding command port should be enabled.

Optional properties:

    - label : name that you want this bridge to show up as under
	/sys/class/fpga-bridge.
	Default is br<device#> if this is not specified

Example:
	fpga2sdram_br: fpgabridge@3 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-fpga2sdram-bridge";
		label = "fpga2sdram";
		read-ports-mask = <3>;
		write-ports-mask = <3>;
		cmd-ports-mask = <0xd>;
	};
