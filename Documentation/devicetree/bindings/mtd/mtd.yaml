      User-defined MTD device name. Can be used to assign user friendly
      names to MTD devices (instead of the flash model or flash controller
      based name) in order to ease flash device identification and/or
      describe what they are used for.

    description: |
      An OTP memory region. Some flashes provide a one-time-programmable
      memory whose content can either be programmed by a user or is already
      pre-programmed by the factory. Some flashes might provide both.

          - user-otp
