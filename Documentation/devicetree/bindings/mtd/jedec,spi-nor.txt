* SPI NOR flash: ST M25Pxx (and similar) serial flash chips

Required properties:
- #address-cells, #size-cells : Must be present if the device has sub-nodes
  representing partitions.
- compatible : May include a device-specific string consisting of the
               manufacturer and name of the chip. A list of supported chip
               names follows.
               Must also include "jedec,spi-nor" for any SPI NOR flash that can
               be identified by the JEDEC READ ID opcode (0x9F).

               The following chip names have been used historically to
               designate quirky versions of flash chips that do not support the
               JEDEC READ ID opcode (0x9F):
                 m25p05-nonjedec
                 m25p10-nonjedec
                 m25p20-nonjedec
                 m25p40-nonjedec
                 m25p80-nonjedec
                 m25p16-nonjedec
                 m25p32-nonjedec
                 m25p64-nonjedec
                 m25p128-nonjedec

- reg : Chip-Select number
- spi-max-frequency : Maximum frequency of the SPI bus the chip can operate at

Optional properties:
- m25p,fast-read : Use the "fast read" opcode to read data from the chip instead
                   of the usual "read" opcode. This opcode is not supported by
                   all chips and support for it can not be detected at runtime.
                   Refer to your chips' datasheet to check if this is supported
                   by your chip.

Example:

	flash: m25p80@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "spansion,m25p80", "jedec,spi-nor";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <40000000>;
		m25p,fast-read;
	};
