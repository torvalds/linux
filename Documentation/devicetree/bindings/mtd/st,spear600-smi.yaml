title: STMicroelectronics SPEAr600 Serial Memory Interface (SMI) Controller

description:
  The SPEAr600 Serial Memory Interface (SMI) is a dedicated serial flash
  controller supporting up to four chip selects for serial NOR flashes
  connected in parallel. The controller is memory-mapped and the attached
  flash devices appear in the CPU address space.The driver
  (drivers/mtd/devices/spear_smi.c) probes the attached flashes
  dynamically by sending commands (e.g., RDID) to each bank.
  Flash sub nodes describe the memory range and optional per-flash
  properties.
