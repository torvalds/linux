* NAND chip and NAND controller generic binding

NAND controller/NAND chip representation:

The NAND controller should be represented with its own DT node, and all
NAND chips attached to this controller should be defined as children nodes
of the NAND controller. This representation should be enforced even for
simple controllers supporting only one chip.

Mandatory NAND controller properties:
- #address-cells: depends on your controller. Should at least be 1 to
		  encode the CS line id.
- #size-cells: depends on your controller. Put zero unless you need a
	       mapping between CS lines and dedicated memory regions

Optional NAND controller properties
- ranges: only needed if you need to define a mapping between CS lines and
	  memory regions

Optional NAND chip properties:

- nand-ecc-mode : String, operation mode of the NAND ecc mode.
		  Supported values are: "none", "soft", "hw", "hw_syndrome",
		  "hw_oob_first".
		  Deprecated values:
		  "soft_bch": use "soft" and nand-ecc-algo instead
- nand-ecc-algo: string, algorithm of NAND ECC.
		 Supported values are: "hamming", "bch".
- nand-bus-width : 8 or 16 bus width if not present 8
- nand-on-flash-bbt: boolean to enable on flash bbt option if not present false

- nand-ecc-strength: integer representing the number of bits to correct
		     per ECC step.

- nand-ecc-step-size: integer representing the number of data bytes
		      that are covered by a single ECC step.

The ECC strength and ECC step size properties define the correction capability
of a controller. Together, they say a controller can correct "{strength} bit
errors per {size} bytes".

The interpretation of these parameters is implementation-defined, so not all
implementations must support all possible combinations. However, implementations
are encouraged to further specify the value(s) they support.

Example:

	nand-controller {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		/* controller specific properties */

		nand@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			nand-ecc-mode = "soft_bch";

			/* controller specific properties */
		};
	};
