title: RedBoot FLASH Image System (FIS) Partitions

description: The FLASH Image System (FIS) directory is a flash description
    format closely associated with the RedBoot boot loader.
    It uses one single flash eraseblock in the flash to store an index of
    all images in the flash.
    This block size will vary depending on flash but is typically
    32 KB in size.

      eraseblock at 0x00000000, 1 means the second eraseblock at 0x00008000 and so on.
