title: Fixed partitions

description: |
  This binding can be used on platforms which have strong conventions about
  which portions of a flash are used for what purposes, but which don't use an
  on-flash partition table such as RedBoot.

  The partition table should be a node named "partitions". Partitions are then
  defined as subnodes.

        description: Partition id in Sercomm partition map. Mtd parser
          uses this id to find a record in the partition map containing
          offset and size of the current partition. The values from
          partition map overrides partition offset and size defined in
          reg property of the dts. Frequently these values are the same,
          but may differ if device has bad eraseblocks on a flash.
