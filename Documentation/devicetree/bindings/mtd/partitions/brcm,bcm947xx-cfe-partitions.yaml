title: Broadcom BCM47xx Partitions

description: |
  Broadcom is one of hardware manufacturers providing SoCs (BCM47xx) used in
  home routers. Their BCM947xx boards using CFE bootloader have several
  partitions without any on-flash partition table. On some devices their sizes
  and/or meanings can also vary so fixed partitioning can't be used.

  Discovering partitions on these devices is possible thanks to having a special
  header and/or magic signature at the beginning of each of them. They are also
  block aligned which is important for determinig a size.

  Most of partitions use ASCII text based magic for determining a type. More
  complex partitions (like TRX with its HDR0 magic) may include extra header
  containing some details, including a length.

  A list of supported partitions includes:
  1) Bootloader with Broadcom's CFE (Common Firmware Environment)
  2) NVRAM with configuration/calibration data
  3) Device manufacturer's data with some default values (e.g. SSIDs)
  4) TRX firmware container which can hold up to 4 subpartitions
  5) Backup TRX firmware used after failed upgrade

  As mentioned earlier, role of some partitions may depend on extra
  configuration. For example both: main firmware and backup firmware use the
  same TRX format with the same header. To distinguish currently used firmware a
  CFE's environment variable "bootpartition" is used.
