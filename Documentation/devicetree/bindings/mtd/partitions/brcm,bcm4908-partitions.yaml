title: Broadcom BCM4908 partitioning

description: |
  Broadcom BCM4908 CFE bootloader supports two firmware partitions. One is used
  for regular booting, the other is treated as fallback.

  This binding allows defining all fixed partitions and marking those containing
  firmware. System can use that information e.g. for booting or flashing
  purposes.
