* Denali NAND controller

Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "denali,denali-nand-dt"
  - reg : should contain registers location and length for data and reg.
  - reg-names: Should contain the reg names "nand_data" and "denali_reg"
  - interrupts : The interrupt number.
  - dm-mask : DMA bit mask
  - have-hw-ecc-fixup : boolean indicating controller has ECC correction
    in hardware, and also has slightly diffrent interrupt status bits.

The device tree may optionally contain sub-nodes describing partitions of the
address space. See partition.txt for more detail.

Examples:

nand: nand@ff900000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	compatible = "denali,denali-nand-dt";
	reg = <0xff900000 0x100000>, <0xffb80000 0x10000>;
	reg-names = "nand_data", "denali_reg";
	interrupts = <0 144 4>;
	dma-mask = <0xffffffff>;
	have-hw-ecc-fixup;
};
