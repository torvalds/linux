ST Microelectronics Flexible Static Memory Controller (FSMC)
NAND Interface

Required properties:
- compatible : "st,spear600-fsmc-nand", "stericsson,fsmc-nand"
- reg : Address range of the mtd chip
- reg-names: Should contain the reg names "fsmc_regs", "nand_data", "nand_addr" and "nand_cmd"

Optional properties:
- bank-width : Width (in bytes) of the device.  If not present, the width
  defaults to 1 byte
- nand-skip-bbtscan: Indicates the BBT scanning should be skipped
- timings: array of 6 bytes for NAND timings. The meanings of these bytes
  are:
  byte 0 TCLR  : CLE to RE delay in number of AHB clock cycles, only 4 bits
                 are valid. Zero means one clockcycle, 15 means 16 clock
                 cycles.
  byte 1 TAR   : ALE to RE delay, 4 bits are valid. Same format as TCLR.
  byte 2 THIZ  : number of HCLK clock cycles during which the data bus is
                 kept in Hi-Z (tristate) after the start of a write access.
                 Only valid for write transactions. Zero means zero cycles,
                 255 means 255 cycles.
  byte 3 THOLD : number of HCLK clock cycles to hold the address (and data
                 when writing) after the command deassertation. Zero means
                 one cycle, 255 means 256 cycles.
  byte 4 TWAIT : number of HCLK clock cycles to assert the command to the
                 NAND flash in response to SMWAITn. Zero means 1 cycle,
                 255 means 256 cycles.
  byte 5 TSET  : number of HCLK clock cycles to assert the address before the
                 command is asserted. Zero means one cycle, 255 means 256
                 cycles.
- bank: default NAND bank to use (0-3 are valid, 0 is the default).
- nand-ecc-mode      : see nand.txt
- nand-ecc-strength  : see nand.txt
- nand-ecc-step-size : see nand.txt

Can support 1-bit HW ECC (default) or if stronger correction is required,
software-based BCH.

Example:

	fsmc: flash@d1800000 {
		compatible = "st,spear600-fsmc-nand";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0xd1800000 0x1000	/* FSMC Register */
		       0xd2000000 0x0010	/* NAND Base DATA */
		       0xd2020000 0x0010	/* NAND Base ADDR */
		       0xd2010000 0x0010>;	/* NAND Base CMD */
		reg-names = "fsmc_regs", "nand_data", "nand_addr", "nand_cmd";

		bank-width = <1>;
		nand-skip-bbtscan;
		timings = /bits/ 8 <0 0 0 2 3 0>;
		bank = <1>;

		partition@0 {
			...
		};
	};
