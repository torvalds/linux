title: Real Time Clock of the Sophgo CV1800 SoC

description:
  The RTC (Real Time Clock) is an independently powered module in the chip. It
  contains a 32KHz oscillator and a Power-On-Reset (POR) sub-module, which can
  be used for time display and scheduled alarm produce. In addition, the
  hardware state machine provides triggering and timing control for chip
  power-on, power-off and reset.

  Furthermore, the 8051 subsystem is located within RTCSYS and is independently
  powered. System software can use the 8051 to manage wake conditions and wake
  the system while the system is asleep, and communicate with external devices
  through peripheral controllers.
