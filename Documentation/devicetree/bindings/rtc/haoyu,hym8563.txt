Haoyu Microelectronics HYM8563 Real Time Clock

The HYM8563 provides basic rtc and alarm functionality
as well as a clock output of up to 32kHz.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be: "haoyu,hym8563"
- reg: i2c address
- interrupts: rtc alarm/event interrupt
- #clock-cells: the value should be 0

Example:

hym8563: hym8563@51 {
	compatible = "haoyu,hym8563";
	reg = <0x51>;

	interrupts = <13 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;

	#clock-cells = <0>;
};

device {
...
	clocks = <&hym8563>;
...
};
