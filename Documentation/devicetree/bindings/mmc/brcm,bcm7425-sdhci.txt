* BROADCOM BRCMSTB/BMIPS SDHCI Controller

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the sdhci-brcmstb driver.

NOTE: The driver disables all UHS speed modes by default and depends
on Device Tree properties to enable them for SoC/Board combinations
that support them.

Required properties:
- compatible: "brcm,bcm7425-sdhci"

Refer to clocks/clock-bindings.txt for generic clock consumer properties.

Example:

	sdhci@f03e0100 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm7425-sdhci";
		reg = <0xf03e0000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0x0 0x26 0x0>;
		sdhci,auto-cmd12;
		clocks = <&sw_sdio>;
		sd-uhs-sdr50;
		sd-uhs-ddr50;
	};

	sdhci@f03e0300 {
		non-removable;
		bus-width = <0x8>;
		compatible = "brcm,bcm7425-sdhci";
		reg = <0xf03e0200 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0x0 0x27 0x0>;
		sdhci,auto-cmd12;
		clocks = <sw_sdio>;
		mmc-hs200-1_8v;
	};
