Device Tree Bindings for the Arasan SDHCI Controller

  The bindings follow the mmc[1], clock[2], interrupt[3] and phy[4] bindings.
  Only deviations are documented here.

Required Properties:
  - compatible: Compatibility string.  One of:
    - "arasan,sdhci-8.9a": generic Arasan SDHCI 8.9a PHY
    - "arasan,sdhci-4.9a": generic Arasan SDHCI 4.9a PHY
    - "arasan,sdhci-5.1": generic Arasan SDHCI 5.1 PHY
    - "rockchip,rk3399-sdhci-5.1", "arasan,sdhci-5.1": rk3399 eMMC PHY
      For this device it is strongly suggested to include arasan,soc-ctl-syscon.
  - reg: From mmc bindings: Register location and length.
  - clocks: From clock bindings: Handles to clock inputs.
  - clock-names: From clock bindings: Tuple including "clk_xin" and "clk_ahb"
  - interrupts: Interrupt specifier
  - interrupt-parent: Phandle for the interrupt controller that services
		      interrupts for this device.

Required Properties for "arasan,sdhci-5.1":
  - phys: From PHY bindings: Phandle for the Generic PHY for arasan.
  - phy-names:  MUST be "phy_arasan".

Optional Properties:
  - arasan,soc-ctl-syscon: A phandle to a syscon device (see ../mfd/syscon.txt)
    used to access core corecfg registers.  Offsets of registers in this
    syscon are determined based on the main compatible string for the device.

Example:
	sdhci@e0100000 {
		compatible = "arasan,sdhci-8.9a";
		reg = <0xe0100000 0x1000>;
		clock-names = "clk_xin", "clk_ahb";
		clocks = <&clkc 21>, <&clkc 32>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 24 4>;
	} ;

	sdhci@e2800000 {
		compatible = "arasan,sdhci-5.1";
		reg = <0xe2800000 0x1000>;
		clock-names = "clk_xin", "clk_ahb";
		clocks = <&cru 8>, <&cru 18>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 24 4>;
		phys = <&emmc_phy>;
		phy-names = "phy_arasan";
	} ;

	sdhci: sdhci@fe330000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-sdhci-5.1", "arasan,sdhci-5.1";
		reg = <0x0 0xfe330000 0x0 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cru SCLK_EMMC>, <&cru ACLK_EMMC>;
		clock-names = "clk_xin", "clk_ahb";
		arasan,soc-ctl-syscon = <&grf>;
		assigned-clocks = <&cru SCLK_EMMC>;
		assigned-clock-rates = <200000000>;
		phys = <&emmc_phy>;
		phy-names = "phy_arasan";
		status = "disabled";
	};
