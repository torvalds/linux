mmc-card / eMMC bindings
------------------------

This documents describes the devicetree bindings for a mmc-host controller
child node describing a mmc-card / an eMMC, see "Use of Function subnodes"
in mmc.txt

Required properties:
-compatible : Must be "mmc-card"
-reg        : Must be <0>

Optional properties:
-broken-hpi : Use this to indicate that the mmc-card has a broken hpi
              implementation, and that hpi should not be used

Example:

&mmc2 {
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&mmc2_pins_a>;
	vmmc-supply = <&reg_vcc3v3>;
	bus-width = <8>;
	non-removable;
	status = "okay";

	mmccard: mmccard@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		compatible = "mmc-card";
		broken-hpi;
	};
};
