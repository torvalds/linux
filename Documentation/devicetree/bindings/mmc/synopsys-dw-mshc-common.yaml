# Everything else is described in the common file
properties:
  resets:
    maxItems: 1

  reset-names:
    const: reset

  clock-frequency:
    description:
      Should be the frequency (in Hz) of the ciu clock.  If this
      is specified and the ciu clock is specified then we'll try to set the ciu
      clock to this at probe time.

  fifo-depth:
    allOf:
      - $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      The maximum size of the tx/rx fifo's. If this property is not
      specified, the default value of the fifo size is determined from the
      controller registers.

  card-detect-delay:
    allOf:
      - $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
      - default: 0
    description:
      Delay in milli-seconds before detecting card after card
      insert event. The default value is 0.

  data-addr:
    allOf:
      - $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      Override fifo address with value provided by DT. The default FIFO reg
      offset is assumed as 0x100 (version < 0x240A) and 0x200(version >= 0x240A)
      by driver. If the controller does not follow this rule, please use
      this property to set fifo address in device tree.

  fifo-watermark-aligned:
    allOf:
      - $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/flag
    description:
      Data done irq is expected if data length is less than
      watermark in PIO mode. But fifo watermark is requested to be aligned
      with data length in some SoC so that TX/RX irq can be generated with
      data done irq. Add this watermark quirk to mark this requirement and
      force fifo watermark setting accordingly.

  dmas:
    maxItems: 1

  dma-names:
    const: rx-tx
