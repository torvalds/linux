* Ingenic XBurst MMC controllers

This file documents the device tree properties used for the MMC controller in
Ingenic JZ4740/JZ4760/JZ4780/X1000 SoCs. These are in addition to the core MMC
properties described in mmc.txt.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of the following:
  - "ingenic,jz4740-mmc" for the JZ4740
  - "ingenic,jz4725b-mmc" for the JZ4725B
  - "ingenic,jz4760-mmc" for the JZ4760
  - "ingenic,jz4780-mmc" for the JZ4780
  - "ingenic,x1000-mmc" for the X1000
- reg: Should contain the MMC controller registers location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain the interrupt specifier of the MMC controller.
- clocks: Clock for the MMC controller.

Optional properties:
- dmas: List of DMA specifiers with the controller specific format
        as described in the generic DMA client binding. A tx and rx
        specifier is required.
- dma-names: RX and TX  DMA request names.
        Should be "rx" and "tx", in that order.

For additional details on DMA client bindings see ../dma/dma.txt.

Example:

mmc0: mmc@13450000 {
	compatible = "ingenic,jz4780-mmc";
	reg = <0x13450000 0x1000>;

	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupts = <37>;

	clocks = <&cgu JZ4780_CLK_MSC0>;
	clock-names = "mmc";

	dmas = <&dma JZ4780_DMA_MSC0_RX 0xffffffff>, <&dma JZ4780_DMA_MSC0_TX 0xffffffff>;
	dma-names = "rx", "tx";
};
