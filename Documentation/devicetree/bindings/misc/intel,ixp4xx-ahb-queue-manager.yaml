title: Intel IXP4xx AHB Queue Manager

description: |
  The IXP4xx AHB Queue Manager maintains queues as circular buffers in
  an 8KB embedded SRAM along with hardware pointers. It is used by both
  the XScale processor and the NPEs (Network Processing Units) in the
  IXP4xx for accelerating queues, especially for networking. Clients pick
  queues from the queue manager with foo-queue = <&qmgr N> where the
  &qmgr is a phandle to the queue manager and N is the queue resource
  number. The queue resources available and their specific purpose
  on a certain IXP4xx system will vary.
