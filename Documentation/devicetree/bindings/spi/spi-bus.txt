SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) busses

SPI busses can be described with a node for the SPI master device
and a set of child nodes for each SPI slave on the bus.  For this
discussion, it is assumed that the system's SPI controller is in
SPI master mode.  This binding does not describe SPI controllers
in slave mode.

The SPI master node requires the following properties:
- #address-cells  - number of cells required to define a chip select
    		address on the SPI bus.
- #size-cells     - should be zero.
- compatible      - name of SPI bus controller following generic names
    		recommended practice.
- cs-gpios	  - (optional) gpios chip select.
No other properties are required in the SPI bus node.  It is assumed
that a driver for an SPI bus device will understand that it is an SPI bus.
However, the binding does not attempt to define the specific method for
assigning chip select numbers.  Since SPI chip select configuration is
flexible and non-standardized, it is left out of this binding with the
assumption that board specific platform code will be used to manage
chip selects.  Individual drivers can define additional properties to
support describing the chip select layout.

Optional property:
- num-cs : total number of chipselects

If cs-gpios is used the number of chip select will automatically increased
with max(cs-gpios > hw cs)

So if for example the controller has 2 CS lines, and the cs-gpios
property looks like this:

cs-gpios = <&gpio1 0 0> <0> <&gpio1 1 0> <&gpio1 2 0>;

Then it should be configured so that num_chipselect = 4 with the
following mapping:

cs0 : &gpio1 0 0
cs1 : native
cs2 : &gpio1 1 0
cs3 : &gpio1 2 0

SPI slave nodes must be children of the SPI master node and can
contain the following properties.
- reg             - (required) chip select address of device.
- compatible      - (required) name of SPI device following generic names
    		recommended practice
- spi-max-frequency - (required) Maximum SPI clocking speed of device in Hz
- spi-cpol        - (optional) Empty property indicating device requires
    		inverse clock polarity (CPOL) mode
- spi-cpha        - (optional) Empty property indicating device requires
    		shifted clock phase (CPHA) mode
- spi-cs-high     - (optional) Empty property indicating device requires
    		chip select active high
- spi-3wire       - (optional) Empty property indicating device requires
    		    3-wire mode.
- spi-tx-bus-width - (optional) The bus width(number of data wires) that
                      used for MOSI. Defaults to 1 if not present.
- spi-rx-bus-width - (optional) The bus width(number of data wires) that
                      used for MISO. Defaults to 1 if not present.

Some SPI controllers and devices support Dual and Quad SPI transfer mode.
It allows data in SPI system transfered in 2 wires(DUAL) or 4 wires(QUAD).
Now the value that spi-tx-bus-width and spi-rx-bus-width can receive is
only 1(SINGLE), 2(DUAL) and 4(QUAD).
Dual/Quad mode is not allowed when 3-wire mode is used.

If a gpio chipselect is used for the SPI slave the gpio number will be passed
via the cs_gpio

SPI example for an MPC5200 SPI bus:
	spi@f00 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "fsl,mpc5200b-spi","fsl,mpc5200-spi";
		reg = <0xf00 0x20>;
		interrupts = <2 13 0 2 14 0>;
		interrupt-parent = <&mpc5200_pic>;

		ethernet-switch@0 {
			compatible = "micrel,ks8995m";
			spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
			reg = <0>;
		};

		codec@1 {
			compatible = "ti,tlv320aic26";
			spi-max-frequency = <100000>;
			reg = <1>;
		};
	};
