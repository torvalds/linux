SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) busses

SPI busses can be described with a node for the SPI master device
and a set of child nodes for each SPI slave on the bus.  For this
discussion, it is assumed that the system's SPI controller is in
SPI master mode.  This binding does not describe SPI controllers
in slave mode.

The SPI master node requires the following properties:
- #address-cells  - number of cells required to define a chip select
    		address on the SPI bus.
- #size-cells     - should be zero.
- compatible      - name of SPI bus controller following generic names
    		recommended practice.
No other properties are required in the SPI bus node.  It is assumed
that a driver for an SPI bus device will understand that it is an SPI bus.
However, the binding does not attempt to define the specific method for
assigning chip select numbers.  Since SPI chip select configuration is
flexible and non-standardized, it is left out of this binding with the
assumption that board specific platform code will be used to manage
chip selects.  Individual drivers can define additional properties to
support describing the chip select layout.

Optional property:
- num-cs : total number of chipselects

SPI slave nodes must be children of the SPI master node and can
contain the following properties.
- reg             - (required) chip select address of device.
- compatible      - (required) name of SPI device following generic names
    		recommended practice
- spi-max-frequency - (required) Maximum SPI clocking speed of device in Hz
- spi-cpol        - (optional) Empty property indicating device requires
    		inverse clock polarity (CPOL) mode
- spi-cpha        - (optional) Empty property indicating device requires
    		shifted clock phase (CPHA) mode
- spi-cs-high     - (optional) Empty property indicating device requires
    		chip select active high

SPI example for an MPC5200 SPI bus:
	spi@f00 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "fsl,mpc5200b-spi","fsl,mpc5200-spi";
		reg = <0xf00 0x20>;
		interrupts = <2 13 0 2 14 0>;
		interrupt-parent = <&mpc5200_pic>;

		ethernet-switch@0 {
			compatible = "micrel,ks8995m";
			spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
			reg = <0>;
		};

		codec@1 {
			compatible = "ti,tlv320aic26";
			spi-max-frequency = <100000>;
			reg = <1>;
		};
	};
