Synopsys DesignWare AMBA 2.0 Synchronous Serial Interface.

Required properties:
- compatible : "snps,dw-apb-ssi" or "mscc,<soc>-spi", where soc is "ocelot" or
  "jaguar2", or "amazon,alpine-dw-apb-ssi", or "snps,dwc-ssi-1.01a" or
  "intel,keembay-ssi"
- reg : The register base for the controller. For "mscc,<soc>-spi", a second
  register set is required (named ICPU_CFG:SPI_MST)
- interrupts : One interrupt, used by the controller.
- #address-cells : <1>, as required by generic SPI binding.
- #size-cells : <0>, also as required by generic SPI binding.
- clocks : phandles for the clocks, see the description of clock-names below.
   The phandle for the "ssi_clk" is required. The phandle for the "pclk" clock
   is optional. If a single clock is specified but no clock-name, it is the
   "ssi_clk" clock. If both clocks are listed, the "ssi_clk" must be first.

Optional properties:
- clock-names : Contains the names of the clocks:
    "ssi_clk", for the core clock used to generate the external SPI clock.
    "pclk", the interface clock, required for register access. If a clock domain
     used to enable this clock then it should be named "pclk_clkdomain".
- cs-gpios : Specifies the gpio pins to be used for chipselects.
- num-cs : The number of chipselects. If omitted, this will default to 4.
- reg-io-width : The I/O register width (in bytes) implemented by this
  device.  Supported values are 2 or 4 (the default).

Child nodes as per the generic SPI binding.

Example:

	spi@fff00000 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-apb-ssi";
		reg = <0xfff00000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 154 4>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&spi_m_clk>;
		num-cs = <2>;
		cs-gpios = <&gpio0 13 0>,
			   <&gpio0 14 0>;
	};
