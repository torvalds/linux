title: Peripheral-specific properties for a SPI bus.

description:
  Many SPI controllers need to add properties to peripheral devices. They could
  be common properties like spi-max-frequency, spi-cpha, etc. or they could be
  controller specific like delay in clock or data lines, etc. These properties
  need to be defined in the peripheral node because they are per-peripheral and
  there can be multiple peripherals attached to a controller. All those
  properties are listed here. The controller specific properties should go in
  their own separate schema that should be referenced from here.
