description: |
  SPI busses can be described with a node for the SPI controller device
  and a set of child nodes for each SPI slave on the bus. The system SPI
  controller may be described for use in SPI master mode or in SPI slave mode,
  but not for both at the same time.

properties:
  $nodename:
    pattern: "^spi(@.*|-[0-9a-f])*$"

  "#address-cells":
    const: 1

  "#size-cells":
    const: 0

  cs-gpios:
    description: |
      GPIOs used as chip selects.
      If that property is used, the number of chip selects will be
      increased automatically with max(cs-gpios, hardware chip selects).

      So if, for example, the controller has 2 CS lines, and the
      cs-gpios looks like this
        cs-gpios = <&gpio1 0 0>, <0>, <&gpio1 1 0>, <&gpio1 2 0>;

      Then it should be configured so that num_chipselect = 4, with
      the following mapping
        cs0 : &gpio1 0 0
        cs1 : native
        cs2 : &gpio1 1 0
        cs3 : &gpio1 2 0
