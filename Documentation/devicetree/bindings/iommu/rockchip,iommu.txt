Rockchip IOMMU
==============

A Rockchip DRM iommu translates io virtual addresses to physical addresses for
its master device.  Each slave device is bound to a single master device, and
shares its clocks, power domain and irq.

Required properties:
- compatible      : Should be "rockchip,iommu"
- reg             : Address space for the configuration registers
- interrupts      : Interrupt specifier for the IOMMU instance
- interrupt-names : Interrupt name for the IOMMU instance
- #iommu-cells    : Should be <0>.  This indicates the iommu is a
                    "single-master" device, and needs no additional information
                    to associate with its master device.  See:
                    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/iommu.txt

Example:

	vopl_mmu: iommu@ff940300 {
		compatible = "rockchip,iommu";
		reg = <0xff940300 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 16 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "vopl_mmu";
		#iommu-cells = <0>;
	};
