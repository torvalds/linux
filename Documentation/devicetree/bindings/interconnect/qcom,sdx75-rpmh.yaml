description:
  RPMh interconnect providers support system bandwidth requirements through
  RPMh hardware accelerators known as Bus Clock Manager (BCM). The provider is
  able to communicate with the BCM through the Resource State Coordinator (RSC)
  associated with each execution environment. Provider nodes must point to at
  least one RPMh device child node pertaining to their RSC and each provider
  can map to multiple RPMh resources.
