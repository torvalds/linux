description: |
  Bandwidth Monitor measures current throughput on buses between various NoC
  fabrics and provides information when it crosses configured thresholds.

  Certain SoCs might have more than one Bandwidth Monitors, for example on SDM845::
   - Measuring the bandwidth between CPUs and Last Level Cache Controller -
     called just BWMON,
   - Measuring the bandwidth between Last Level Cache Controller and memory
     (DDR) - called LLCC BWMON.
