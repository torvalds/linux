= SoundWire devices
Each subnode of the bus represents SoundWire device attached to it.
The properties of these nodes are defined by the individual bindings.

= EXAMPLE
The following example represents a SoundWire controller on DB845c board
which has controller integrated inside WCD934x codec on SDM845 SoC.

soundwire: soundwire@c85 {
	compatible = "qcom,soundwire-v1.3.0";
	reg = <0xc85 0x20>;
	interrupts = <20 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
	clocks = <&wcc>;
	clock-names = "iface";
	#sound-dai-cells = <1>;
	qcom,dports-type = <0>;
	qcom,dout-ports	= <6>;
	qcom,din-ports	= <2>;
	qcom,ports-sinterval-low = /bits/ 8  <0x07 0x1F 0x3F 0x7 0x1F 0x3F 0x0F 0x0F>;
	qcom,ports-offset1 = /bits/ 8 <0x01 0x02 0x0C 0x6 0x12 0x0D 0x07 0x0A >;
