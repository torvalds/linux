title: ARM memory mapped architected timer

description: |+
  ARM cores may have a memory mapped architected timer, which provides up to 8
  frames with a physical and optional virtual timer per frame.

  The memory mapped timer is attached to a GIC to deliver its interrupts via SPIs.

properties:
  compatible:
    items:
      - enum:
        - arm,armv7-timer-mem

  reg:
    maxItems: 1
    description: The control frame base address

  '#address-cells':
    enum: [1, 2]

  '#size-cells':
    const: 1

  clock-frequency:
    description: The frequency of the main counter, in Hz. Should be present
      only where necessary to work around broken firmware which does not configure
      CNTFRQ on all CPUs to a uniform correct value. Use of this property is
      strongly discouraged; fix your firmware unless absolutely impossible.

  always-on:
    type: boolean
    description: If present, the timer is powered through an always-on power
      domain, therefore it never loses context.

  arm,cpu-registers-not-fw-configured:
    type: boolean
    description: Firmware does not initialize any of the generic timer CPU
      registers, which contain their architecturally-defined reset values. Only
      supported for 32-bit systems which follow the ARMv7 architected reset
      values.

  arm,no-tick-in-suspend:
    type: boolean
    description: The main counter does not tick when the system is in
      low-power system suspend on some SoCs. This behavior does not match the
      Architecture Reference Manual's specification that the system counter "must
      be implemented in an always-on power domain."
