title: ARM sp804 Dual Timers

description: |+
  The Arm SP804 IP implements two independent timers, configurable for
  16 or 32 bit operation and capable of running in one-shot, periodic, or
  free-running mode. The input clock is shared, but can be gated and prescaled
  independently for each timer.

  There is a viriant of Arm SP804: Hisilicon 64-bit SP804 timer. Some Hisilicon
  SoCs, such as Hi1212, should use the dedicated compatible: "hisilicon,sp804".

# Need a custom select here or 'arm,primecell' will match on lots of nodes

  interrupts:
    description: |
      If two interrupts are listed, those are the interrupts for timer
      1 and 2, respectively. If there is only a single interrupt, it is
      either a combined interrupt or the sole interrupt of one timer, as
      specified by the "arm,sp804-has-irq" property.

  clocks:
    description: |
      Clocks driving the dual timer hardware. This list should
      be 1 or 3 clocks. With 3 clocks, the order is timer0 clock, timer1
      clock, apb_pclk. A single clock can also be specified if the same
      clock is used for all clock inputs.

      - items:

        - description: clock for timer 2
        - description: bus clock
      - items:
        - description: unified clock for both timers and the bus

  clock-names: true
    # The original binding did not specify any clock names, and there is no
    # consistent naming used in the existing DTs. The primecell binding
    # requires the "apb_pclk" name, so we need this property.
    # Use "timer0clk", "timer1clk", "apb_pclk" for new DTs.

  arm,sp804-has-irq:
    description: If only one interrupt line is connected to the interrupt
      controller, this property specifies which timer is connected to this
