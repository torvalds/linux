NXP Low Power Timer/Pulse Width Modulation Module (TPM)

The Timer/PWM Module (TPM) supports input capture, output compare,
and the generation of PWM signals to control electric motor and power
management applications. The counter, compare and capture registers
are clocked by an asynchronous clock that can remain enabled in low
power modes. TPM can support global counter bus where one TPM drives
the counter bus for the others, provided bit width is the same.

Required properties:

- compatible :	should be "fsl,imx7ulp-tpm"
- reg :		Specifies base physical address and size of the register sets
		for the clock event device and clock source device.
- interrupts :	Should be the clock event device interrupt.
- clocks :	The clocks provided by the SoC to drive the timer, must contain
		an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names : Must include the following entries: "igp" and "per".

Example:
tpm5: tpm@40260000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx7ulp-tpm";
	reg = <0x40260000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 22 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&clks IMX7ULP_CLK_NIC1_BUS_DIV>,
		 <&clks IMX7ULP_CLK_LPTPM5>;
	clock-names = "ipg", "per";
};
