Required properties:

- compatible : should be "altr,timer-1.0"
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- interrupt-parent: phandle of the interrupt controller
- interrupts : Should contain the timer interrupt number
- clock-frequency : The frequency of the clock that drives the counter, in Hz.

Example:

timer {
	compatible = "altr,timer-1.0";
	reg = <0x00400000 0x00000020>;
	interrupt-parent = <&cpu>;
	interrupts = <11>;
	clock-frequency = <125000000>;
};
