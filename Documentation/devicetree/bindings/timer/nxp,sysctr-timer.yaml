description: |
  The system counter(sys_ctr) is a programmable system counter
  which provides a shared time base to Cortex A15, A7, A53, A73,
  etc. it is intended for use in applications where the counter
  is always powered and support multiple, unrelated clocks. The
  compare frame inside can be used for timer purpose.
