description:
  The BD2606 MVV is a programmable LED controller connected via I2C that can
  drive 6 separate lines. Each of them can be individually switched on and off,
  but the brightness setting is shared between pairs of them.

  Datasheet is available at
  https://fscdn.rohm.com/en/products/databook/datasheet/ic/power/led_driver/bd2606mvv_1-e.pdf
