title: Common properties for the multicolor LED class.

description: |
  Bindings for multi color LEDs show how to describe current outputs of
  either integrated multi-color LED elements (like RGB, RGBW, RGBWA-UV
  etc.) or standalone LEDs, to achieve logically grouped multi-color LED
  modules. This is achieved by adding multi-led nodes layer to the
  monochrome LED bindings.
  The nodes and properties defined in this document are unique to the multicolor
  LED class.  Common LED nodes and properties are inherited from the common.yaml
  within this documentation directory.
