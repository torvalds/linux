description:
  This binding is used to describe a basic backlight device made of LEDs. It
  can also be used to describe a backlight device controlled by the output of
  a LED driver.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: led-backlight

  leds:
    description: A list of LED nodes
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/phandle-array
    items:
      maxItems: 1

  brightness-levels:
    description:
      Array of distinct brightness levels. The levels must be in the range
      accepted by the underlying LED devices. This is used to translate a
      backlight brightness level into a LED brightness level. If it is not
      provided, the identity mapping is used.

  default-brightness-level:
    description:
      The default brightness level (index into the array defined by the
      "brightness-levels" property).
