properties:
  compatible:
    const: pwm-backlight

  pwms:
    maxItems: 1

  pwm-names: true

  power-supply:
    description: regulator for supply voltage

  enable-gpios:
    description:
      Contains a single GPIO specifier for the GPIO which enables and disables
      the backlight.
    maxItems: 1

  post-pwm-on-delay-ms:
    description:
      Delay in ms between setting an initial (non-zero) PWM and enabling the
      backlight using GPIO.

  pwm-off-delay-ms:
    description:
      Delay in ms between disabling the backlight using GPIO and setting PWM
      value to 0.

  brightness-levels:
    description:
      Array of distinct brightness levels. Typically these are in the range
      from 0 to 255, but any range starting at 0 will do. The actual brightness
      level (PWM duty cycle) will be interpolated from these values. 0 means a
      0% duty cycle (darkest/off), while the last value in the array represents
      a 100% duty cycle (brightest).
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32-array

  default-brightness-level:
    description:
      The default brightness level (index into the array defined by the
      "brightness-levels" property).
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32

  num-interpolated-steps:
    description:
      Number of interpolated steps between each value of brightness-levels
      table. This way a high resolution pwm duty cycle can be used without
      having to list out every possible value in the brightness-level array.
