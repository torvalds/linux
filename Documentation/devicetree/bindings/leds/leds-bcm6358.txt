LEDs connected to Broadcom BCM6358 controller

This controller is present on BCM6358 and BCM6368.
In these SoCs there are Serial LEDs (LEDs connected to a 74x164 controller),
which can either be controlled by software (exporting the 74x164 as spi-gpio.
See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio-74x164.txt), or
by hardware using this driver.

Required properties:
  - compatible : should be "brcm,bcm6358-leds".
  - #address-cells : must be 1.
  - #size-cells : must be 0.
  - reg : BCM6358 LED controller address and size.

Optional properties:
  - brcm,clk-div : SCK signal divider. Possible values are 1, 2, 4 and 8.
    Default : 1
  - brcm,clk-dat-low : Boolean, makes clock and data signals active low.
    Default : false

Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the brcm,bcm6358-leds device.

LED sub-node required properties:
  - reg : LED pin number (only LEDs 0 to 31 are valid).

LED sub-node optional properties:
  - label : see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
  - active-low : Boolean, makes LED active low.
    Default : false
  - default-state : see
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/leds-gpio.txt
  - linux,default-trigger : see
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
