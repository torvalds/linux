title: Faraday Technology FTIDE010 PATA controller

maintainers:
  - Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>

description: |
  This controller is the first Faraday IDE interface block, used in the
  StorLink SL3512 and SL3516, later known as the Cortina Systems Gemini
  platform. The controller can do PIO modes 0 through 4, Multi-word DMA
  (MWDM) modes 0 through 2 and Ultra DMA modes 0 through 6.

  On the Gemini platform, this PATA block is accompanied by a PATA to
  SATA bridge in order to support SATA. This is why a phandle to that
  controller is compulsory on that platform.

  The timing properties are unique per-SoC, not per-board.
