* APM X-Gene 6.0 Gb/s SATA host controller nodes

SATA host controller nodes are defined to describe on-chip Serial ATA
controllers. Each SATA controller (pair of ports) have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible		: Shall contain:
  * "apm,xgene-ahci"
- reg			: First memory resource shall be the AHCI memory
			  resource.
			  Second memory resource shall be the host controller
			  core memory resource.
			  Third memory resource shall be the host controller
			  diagnostic memory resource.
			  4th memory resource shall be the host controller
			  AXI memory resource.
			  5th optional memory resource shall be the host
			  controller MUX memory resource if required.
- interrupts		: Interrupt-specifier for SATA host controller IRQ.
- clocks		: Reference to the clock entry.
- phys			: A list of phandles + phy-specifiers, one for each
			  entry in phy-names.
- phy-names		: Should contain:
  * "sata-phy" for the SATA 6.0Gbps PHY

Optional properties:
- status		: Shall be "ok" if enabled or "disabled" if disabled.
			  Default is "ok".

Example:
		sataclk: sataclk {
			compatible = "fixed-clock";
			#clock-cells = <1>;
			clock-frequency = <100000000>;
			clock-output-names = "sataclk";
		};

		phy2: phy@1f22a000 {
			compatible = "apm,xgene-phy";
			reg = <0x0 0x1f22a000 0x0 0x100>;
			#phy-cells = <1>;
		};

		phy3: phy@1f23a000 {
			compatible = "apm,xgene-phy";
			reg = <0x0 0x1f23a000 0x0 0x100>;
			#phy-cells = <1>;
		};

		sata2: sata@1a400000 {

			      <0x0 0x1f227000 0x0 0x1000>;
			interrupts = <0x0 0x87 0x4>;
			status = "ok";
			clocks = <&sataclk 0>;
