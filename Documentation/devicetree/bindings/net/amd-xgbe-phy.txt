* AMD 10GbE PHY driver (amd-xgbe-phy)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "amd,xgbe-phy-seattle-v1a" and
  "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c45"
- reg: Address and length of the register sets for the device
   - SerDes Rx/Tx registers
   - SerDes integration registers (1/2)
   - SerDes integration registers (2/2)
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device
- interrupts: Should contain the amd-xgbe-phy interrupt.

Optional properties:
- amd,speed-set: Speed capabilities of the device
    0 - 1GbE and 10GbE (default)
    1 - 2.5GbE and 10GbE

The following optional properties are represented by an array with each
value corresponding to a particular speed. The first array value represents
the setting for the 1GbE speed, the second value for the 2.5GbE speed and
the third value for the 10GbE speed.  All three values are required if the
property is used.
- amd,serdes-blwc: Baseline wandering correction enablement
    0 - Off
    1 - On
- amd,serdes-cdr-rate: CDR rate speed selection
- amd,serdes-pq-skew: PQ (data sampling) skew
- amd,serdes-tx-amp: TX amplitude boost

Example:
	xgbe_phy@e1240800 {
		compatible = "amd,xgbe-phy-seattle-v1a", "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c45";
		reg = <0 0xe1240800 0 0x00400>,
		      <0 0xe1250000 0 0x00060>,
		      <0 0xe1250080 0 0x00004>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 323 4>;
		amd,speed-set = <0>;
		amd,serdes-blwc = <1>, <1>, <0>;
		amd,serdes-cdr-rate = <2>, <2>, <7>;
		amd,serdes-pq-skew = <10>, <10>, <30>;
		amd,serdes-tx-amp = <15>, <15>, <10>;
	};
