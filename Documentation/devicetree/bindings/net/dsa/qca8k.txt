* Qualcomm Atheros QCA8xxx switch family

Required properties:

- compatible: should be one of:
    "qca,qca8328": referenced as AR8328(N)-AK1(A/B) QFN 176 pin package
    "qca,qca8327": referenced as AR8327(N)-AL1A DR-QFN 148 pin package
    "qca,qca8334": referenced as QCA8334-AL3C QFN 88 pin package
    "qca,qca8337": referenced as QCA8337N-AL3(B/C) DR-QFN 148 pin package

- #size-cells: must be 0
- #address-cells: must be 1

Optional properties:

- reset-gpios: GPIO to be used to reset the whole device
- qca,ignore-power-on-sel: Ignore power on pin strapping to configure led open
                           drain or eeprom presence. This is needed for broken
                           devices that have wrong configuration or when the oem
                           decided to not use pin strapping and fallback to sw
                           regs.
- qca,led-open-drain: Set leds to open-drain mode. This requires the
                      qca,ignore-power-on-sel to be set or the driver will fail
                      to probe. This is needed if the oem doesn't use pin
                      strapping to set this mode and prefers to set it using sw
                      regs. The pin strapping related to led open drain mode is
                      the pin B68 for QCA832x and B49 for QCA833x

Subnodes:

The integrated switch subnode should be specified according to the binding
described in dsa/dsa.txt. If the QCA8K switch is connect to a SoC's external
mdio-bus each subnode describing a port needs to have a valid phandle
referencing the internal PHY it is connected to. This is because there's no
N:N mapping of port and PHY id.
To declare the internal mdio-bus configuration, declare a mdio node in the
switch node and declare the phandle for the port referencing the internal
PHY is connected to. In this config a internal mdio-bus is registered and
the mdio MASTER is used as communication.

Don't use mixed external and internal mdio-bus configurations, as this is
not supported by the hardware.

This switch support 2 CPU port. Normally and advised configuration is with
CPU port set to port 0. It is also possible to set the CPU port to port 6
if the device requires it. The driver will configure the switch to the defined
port. With both CPU port declared the first CPU port is selected as primary
and the secondary CPU ignored.

A CPU port node has the following optional node:

- fixed-link            : Fixed-link subnode describing a link to a non-MDIO
                          managed entity. See
                          Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/fixed-link.txt
                          for details.
- qca,sgmii-rxclk-falling-edge: Set the receive clock phase to falling edge.
                                Mostly used in qca8327 with CPU port 0 set to
                                sgmii.
- qca,sgmii-txclk-falling-edge: Set the transmit clock phase to falling edge.
- qca,sgmii-enable-pll  : For SGMII CPU port, explicitly enable PLL, TX and RX
                          chain along with Signal Detection.
                          This should NOT be enabled for qca8327. If enabled with
                          qca8327 the sgmii port won't correctly init and an err
                          is printed.
                          This can be required for qca8337 switch with revision 2.
                          A warning is displayed when used with revision greater
                          2.
                          With CPU port set to sgmii and qca8337 it is advised
                          to set this unless a communication problem is observed.

For QCA8K the 'fixed-link' sub-node supports only the following properties:

- 'speed' (integer, mandatory), to indicate the link speed. Accepted
  values are 10, 100 and 1000
- 'full-duplex' (boolean, optional), to indicate that full duplex is
  used. When absent, half duplex is assumed.

Examples:

	&mdio0 {
		phy_port1: phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;

			reg = <1>;
		};

		phy_port3: phy@2 {
			reg = <2>;
		};

		phy_port4: phy@3 {
			reg = <3>;
		};

			reg = <4>;
		};

		switch@10 {
			compatible = "qca,qca8337";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			reset-gpios = <&gpio 42 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
			reg = <0x10>;

			ports {
				#address-cells = <1>;

				port@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					label = "cpu";
					ethernet = <&gmac1>;
					phy-mode = "rgmii";
					fixed-link {

						full-duplex;
					};
				};

				port@1 {
					reg = <1>;
					label = "lan1";
					phy-handle = <&phy_port1>;

				port@4 {

			};
		};
	};

	&mdio0 {
		switch@10 {
			compatible = "qca,qca8337";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			reset-gpios = <&gpio 42 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
			reg = <0x10>;

				#size-cells = <0>;

				port@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					label = "cpu";
					ethernet = <&gmac1>;
					phy-mode = "rgmii";

				port@3 {
					reg = <3>;
					label = "lan3";
