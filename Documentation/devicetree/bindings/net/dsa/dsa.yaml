description:
  This binding represents Ethernet Switches which have a dedicated CPU
  port. That port is usually connected to an Ethernet Controller of the
  SoC. Such setups are typical for embedded devices.

      A two element list indicates which DSA cluster, and position within the
      cluster a switch takes. <0 0> is cluster 0, switch 0. <0 1> is cluster 0,
      switch 1. <1 0> is cluster 1, switch 0. A switch not part of any cluster
      (single device hanging off a CPU port) must not specify this property
