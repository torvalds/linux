Mediatek MT7530 Ethernet switch
================================

Required properties:

- compatible: may be compatible = "mediatek,mt7530"
	or compatible = "mediatek,mt7621"
- #address-cells: Must be 1.
- #size-cells: Must be 0.
- mediatek,mcm: Boolean; if defined, indicates that either MT7530 is the part
	on multi-chip module belong to MT7623A has or the remotely standalone
	chip as the function MT7623N reference board provided for.

If compatible mediatek,mt7530 is set then the following properties are required

- core-supply: Phandle to the regulator node necessary for the core power.
- io-supply: Phandle to the regulator node necessary for the I/O power.
	See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/mt6323-regulator.txt
	for details for the regulator setup on these boards.

If the property mediatek,mcm isn't defined, following property is required

- reset-gpios: Should be a gpio specifier for a reset line.

Else, following properties are required

- resets : Phandle pointing to the system reset controller with
	line index for the ethsys.
- reset-names : Should be set to "mcm".

Required properties for the child nodes within ports container:

- reg: Port address described must be 6 for CPU port and from 0 to 5 for
	user ports.
- phy-mode: String, must be either "trgmii" or "rgmii" for port labeled
	 "cpu".

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/dsa/dsa.txt for a list of additional
required, optional properties and how the integrated switch subnodes must
be specified.

Example:

	&mdio0 {
		switch@0 {
			compatible = "mediatek,mt7530";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			reg = <0>;

			core-supply = <&mt6323_vpa_reg>;
			io-supply = <&mt6323_vemc3v3_reg>;
			reset-gpios = <&pio 33 0>;

			ports {
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;
				reg = <0>;
				port@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					label = "lan0";
				};

				port@1 {
					reg = <1>;
					label = "lan1";
				};

				port@2 {
					reg = <2>;
					label = "lan2";
				};

				port@3 {
					reg = <3>;
					label = "lan3";
				};

				port@4 {
					reg = <4>;
					label = "wan";
				};

				port@6 {
					reg = <6>;
					label = "cpu";
					ethernet = <&gmac0>;
					phy-mode = "trgmii";
					fixed-link {
						speed = <1000>;
						full-duplex;
					};
				};
			};
		};
	};
