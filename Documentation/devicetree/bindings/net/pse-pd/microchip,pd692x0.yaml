    description:
      List of the PD69208T4/PD69204T4/PD69208M PSE managers. Each manager
      have 4 or 8 physical ports according to the chip version. No need to
      specify the SPI chip select as it is automatically detected by the
      PD692x0 PSE controller. The PSE managers have to be described from
      the lowest chip select to the greatest one, which is the detection
      behavior of the PD692x0 PSE controller. The PD692x0 support up to
      12 PSE managers which can expose up to 96 physical ports. All
      physical ports available on a manager have to be described in the
      incremental order even if they are not used.
