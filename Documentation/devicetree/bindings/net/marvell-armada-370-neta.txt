* Marvell Armada 370 / Armada XP / Armada 3700 Ethernet Controller (NETA)

Required properties:
- compatible: could be one of the following:
	"marvell,armada-370-neta"
	"marvell,armada-xp-neta"
	"marvell,armada-3700-neta"
	"marvell,armada-ac5-neta"
- reg: address and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: interrupt for the device
- phy: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- clocks: List of clocks for this device. At least one clock is
  mandatory for the core clock. If several clocks are given, then the
  clock-names property must be used to identify them.

Optional properties:
- tx-csum-limit: maximum mtu supported by port that allow TX checksum.
  Value is presented in bytes. If not used, by default 1600B is set for
  "marvell,armada-370-neta" and 9800B for others.
- clock-names: List of names corresponding to clocks property; shall be
  "core" for core clock and "bus" for the optional bus clock.
- phys: comphy for the ethernet port, see ../phy/phy-bindings.txt

Optional properties (valid only for Armada XP/38x):

- buffer-manager: a phandle to a buffer manager node. Please refer to
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/marvell-neta-bm.txt
- bm,pool-long: ID of a pool, that will accept all packets of a size
  higher than 'short' pool's threshold (if set) and up to MTU value.
  Obligatory, when the port is supposed to use hardware
  buffer management.
- bm,pool-short: ID of a pool, that will be used for accepting
  packets of a size lower than given threshold. If not set, the port
  will use a single 'long' pool for all packets, as defined above.

Example:

ethernet@70000 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-370-neta";
	reg = <0x70000 0x2500>;
	interrupts = <8>;
	clocks = <&gate_clk 4>;
	tx-csum-limit = <9800>
	phy = <&phy0>;
	phy-mode = "rgmii-id";
	buffer-manager = <&bm>;
	bm,pool-long = <0>;
	bm,pool-short = <1>;
};
