Ralink Frame Engine Ethernet controller
=======================================

The Ralink frame engine ethernet controller can be found on Ralink and
Mediatek SoCs (RT288x, RT3x5x, RT366x, RT388x, rt5350, mt7620, mt7621, mt76x8).

Depending on the SoC, there is a number of ports connected to the CPU port
directly and/or via a (gigabit-)switch.

* Ethernet controller node

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of "ralink,rt2880-eth", "ralink,rt3050-eth",
  "ralink,rt3050-eth", "ralink,rt3883-eth", "ralink,rt5350-eth",
  "mediatek,mt7620-eth", "mediatek,mt7621-eth"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device
- interrupts: Should contain the frame engines interrupt
- resets: Should contain the frame engines resets
- reset-names: Should contain the reset names "fe". If a switch is present
  "esw" is also required.


* Ethernet port node

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "ralink,eth-port"
- reg: The number of the physical port
- phy-handle: reference to the node describing the phy

Example:

mdio-bus {
	...
	phy0: ethernet-phy@0 {
		phy-mode = "mii";
		reg = <0>;
	};
};

ethernet@400000 {
	compatible = "ralink,rt2880-eth";
	reg = <0x00400000 10000>;

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	resets = <&rstctrl 18>;
	reset-names = "fe";

	interrupt-parent = <&cpuintc>;
	interrupts = <5>;

	port@0 {
		compatible = "ralink,eth-port";
		reg = <0>;
		phy-handle = <&phy0>;
	};

};
