TI SoC Davinci/Keystone2 MDIO Controller Device Tree Bindings
---------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible		: Should be "ti,davinci_mdio"
			  and "ti,keystone_mdio" for Keystone 2 SoCs
			  and "ti,cpsw-mdio" for am335x, am472x, am57xx/dra7, dm814x SoCs
			  and "ti,am4372-mdio" for am472x SoC
- reg			: physical base address and size of the davinci mdio
			  registers map
- bus_freq		: Mdio Bus frequency

Optional properties:
- ti,hwmods		: Must be "davinci_mdio"

Note: "ti,hwmods" field is used to fetch the base address and irq
resources from TI, omap hwmod data base during device registration.
Future plan is to migrate hwmod data base contents into device tree
blob so that, all the required data will be used from device tree dts
file.

Examples:

	mdio: davinci_mdio@4A101000 {
		compatible = "ti,davinci_mdio";
		reg = <0x4A101000 0x1000>;
		bus_freq = <1000000>;
	};

(or)

	mdio: davinci_mdio@4A101000 {
		compatible = "ti,davinci_mdio";
		ti,hwmods = "davinci_mdio";
		bus_freq = <1000000>;
	};
