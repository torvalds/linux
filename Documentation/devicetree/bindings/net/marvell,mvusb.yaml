title: Marvell USB to MDIO Controller

maintainers:

description: |+
  This controller is mounted on development boards for Marvell's Link Street
  family of Ethernet switches. It allows you to configure the switch's registers
  using the standard MDIO interface.

  Since the device is connected over USB, there is no strict requirement of
  having a device tree representation of the device. But in order to use it with
  the mv88e6xxx driver, you need a device tree node in which to place the switch
  definition.
