* Allwinner GMAC ethernet controller

This device is a platform glue layer for stmmac.
Please see stmmac.txt for the other unchanged properties.

Required properties:
 - compatible:  Should be "allwinner,sun7i-a20-gmac"
 - clocks: Should contain the GMAC main clock, and tx clock
   The tx clock type should be "allwinner,sun7i-a20-gmac-clk"
 - clock-names: Should contain the clock names "stmmaceth",
   and "allwinner_gmac_tx"

Optional properties:
- phy-supply: phandle to a regulator if the PHY needs one

Examples:

	gmac: ethernet@1c50000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun7i-a20-gmac";
		reg = <0x01c50000 0x10000>,
		      <0x01c20164 0x4>;
		interrupts = <0 85 1>;
		interrupt-names = "macirq";
		clocks = <&ahb_gates 49>, <&gmac_tx>;
		clock-names = "stmmaceth", "allwinner_gmac_tx";
		phy-mode = "mii";
	};
