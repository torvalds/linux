# Informative
# ===========
#
# 'phy-modes' & 'phy-connection-type' properties 'rgmii', 'rgmii-id',
# 'rgmii-rxid', and 'rgmii-txid' are frequently used wrongly by
# developers. This informative section clarifies their usage.
#
# The RGMII specification requires a 2ns delay between the data and
# clock signals on the RGMII bus. How this delay is implemented is not
# specified.
#
# One option is to make the clock traces on the PCB longer than the
# data traces. A sufficiently difference in length can provide the 2ns
# delay. If both the RX and TX delays are implemented in this manner,
# 'rgmii' should be used, so indicating the PCB adds the delays.
#
# If the PCB does not add these delays via extra long traces,
# 'rgmii-id' should be used. Here, 'id' refers to 'internal delay',
# where either the MAC or PHY adds the delay.
#
# If only one of the two delays are implemented via extra long clock
# lines, either 'rgmii-rxid' or 'rgmii-txid' should be used,
# indicating the MAC or PHY should implement one of the delays
# internally, while the PCB implements the other delay.
#
# Device Tree describes hardware, and in this case, it describes the
# PCB between the MAC and the PHY, if the PCB implements delays or
# not.
#
# In practice, very few PCBs make use of extra long clock lines. Hence
# any RGMII phy mode other than 'rgmii-id' is probably wrong, and is
# unlikely to be accepted during review without details provided in
# the commit description and comments in the .dts file.
#
# When the PCB does not implement the delays, the MAC or PHY must.  As
# such, this is software configuration, and so not described in Device
# Tree.
#
# The following describes how Linux implements the configuration of
# the MAC and PHY to add these delays when the PCB does not. As stated
# above, developers often get this wrong, and the aim of this section
# is reduce the frequency of these errors by Linux developers. Other
# users of the Device Tree may implement it differently, and still be
# consistent with both the normative and informative description
# above.
#
# By default in Linux, when using phylib/phylink, the MAC is expected
# to read the 'phy-mode' from Device Tree, not implement any delays,
# and pass the value to the PHY. The PHY will then implement delays as
# specified by the 'phy-mode'. The PHY should always be reconfigured
# to implement the needed delays, replacing any setting performed by
# strapping or the bootloader, etc.
#
# Experience to date is that all PHYs which implement RGMII also
# implement the ability to add or not add the needed delays. Hence
# this default is expected to work in all cases. Ignoring this default
# is likely to be questioned by Reviews, and require a strong argument
# to be accepted.
#
# There are a small number of cases where the MAC has hard coded
# delays which cannot be disabled. The 'phy-mode' only describes the
# PCB.  The inability to disable the delays in the MAC does not change
# the meaning of 'phy-mode'. It does however mean that a 'phy-mode' of
# 'rgmii' is now invalid, it cannot be supported, since both the PCB
# and the MAC and PHY adding delays cannot result in a functional
# link. Thus the MAC should report a fatal error for any modes which
# cannot be supported. When the MAC implements the delay, it must
# ensure that the PHY does not also implement the same delay. So it
# must modify the phy-mode it passes to the PHY, removing the delay it
# has added. Failure to remove the delay will result in a
# non-functioning link.
#
# Sometimes there is a need to fine tune the delays. Often the MAC or
# PHY can perform this fine tuning. In the MAC node, the Device Tree
# properties 'rx-internal-delay-ps' and 'tx-internal-delay-ps' should
# be used to indicate fine tuning performed by the MAC. The values
# expected here are small. A value of 2000ps, i.e 2ns, and a phy-mode
# of 'rgmii' will not be accepted by Reviewers.
#
# If the PHY is to perform fine tuning, the properties
# 'rx-internal-delay-ps' and 'tx-internal-delay-ps' in the PHY node
# should be used. When the PHY is implementing delays, e.g. 'rgmii-id'
# these properties should have a value near to 2000ps. If the PCB is
# implementing delays, e.g. 'rgmii', a small value can be used to fine
# tune the delay added by the PCB.
