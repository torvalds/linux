title: NXP Bluetooth chips

description:
  This binding describes UART-attached NXP bluetooth chips. These chips
  are dual-radio chips supporting WiFi and Bluetooth. The bluetooth
  works on standard H4 protocol over 4-wire UART. The RTS and CTS lines
  are used during FW download. To enable power save mode, the host
  asserts break signal over UART-TX line to put the chip into power save
  state. De-asserting break wakes up the BT chip.
