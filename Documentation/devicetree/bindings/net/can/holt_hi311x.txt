* Holt HI-311X stand-alone CAN controller device tree bindings

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be one of the following:
   - "holt,hi3110" for HI-3110
 - reg: SPI chip select.
 - clocks: The clock feeding the CAN controller.
 - interrupt-parent: The parent interrupt controller.
 - interrupts: Should contain IRQ line for the CAN controller.

Optional properties:
 - vdd-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN controller.
 - xceiver-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN transceiver.

Example:
	can0: can@1 {
		compatible = "holt,hi3110";
		reg = <1>;
		clocks = <&clk32m>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio4>;
		interrupts = <13 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		vdd-supply = <&reg5v0>;
		xceiver-supply = <&reg5v0>;
	};
