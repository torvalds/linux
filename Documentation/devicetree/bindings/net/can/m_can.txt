Bosch MCAN controller Device Tree Bindings
-------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible		: Should be "bosch,m_can" for M_CAN controllers
- reg			: physical base address and size of the M_CAN
			  registers map and Message RAM
- reg-names		: Should be "m_can" and "message_ram"
- interrupts		: Should be the interrupt number of M_CAN interrupt
			  line 0 and line 1, could be same if sharing
			  the same interrupt.
- interrupt-names	: Should contain "int0" and "int1"
- clocks		: Clocks used by controller, should be host clock
			  and CAN clock.
- clock-names		: Should contain "hclk" and "cclk"
- pinctrl-<n>		: Pinctrl states as described in bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
- pinctrl-names 	: Names corresponding to the numbered pinctrl states
- bosch,mram-cfg	: Message RAM configuration data.
			  Multiple M_CAN instances can share the same Message
			  RAM and each element(e.g Rx FIFO or Tx Buffer and etc)
			  number in Message RAM is also configurable,
			  so this property is telling driver how the shared or
			  private Message RAM are used by this M_CAN controller.

			  The format should be as follows:
			  <offset sidf_elems xidf_elems rxf0_elems rxf1_elems
			   rxb_elems txe_elems txb_elems>
			  The 'offset' is an address offset of the Message RAM
			  where the following elements start from. This is
			  usually set to 0x0 if you're using a private Message
			  RAM. The remain cells are used to specify how many
			  elements are used for each FIFO/Buffer.

			  M_CAN includes the following elements according to user manual:
			  11-bit Filter	0-128 elements / 0-128 words
			  29-bit Filter	0-64 elements / 0-128 words
			  Rx FIFO 0	0-64 elements / 0-1152 words
			  Rx FIFO 1	0-64 elements / 0-1152 words
			  Rx Buffers	0-64 elements / 0-1152 words
			  Tx Event FIFO	0-32 elements / 0-64 words
			  Tx Buffers	0-32 elements / 0-576 words

			  Please refer to 2.4.1 Message RAM Configuration in
			  Bosch M_CAN user manual for details.

Example:
SoC dtsi:
m_can1: can@20e8000 {
	compatible = "bosch,m_can";
	reg = <0x020e8000 0x4000>, <0x02298000 0x4000>;
	reg-names = "m_can", "message_ram";
	interrupts = <0 114 0x04>,
		     <0 114 0x04>;
	interrupt-names = "int0", "int1";
	clocks = <&clks IMX6SX_CLK_CANFD>,
		 <&clks IMX6SX_CLK_CANFD>;
	clock-names = "hclk", "cclk";
	bosch,mram-cfg = <0x0 0 0 32 0 0 0 1>;
};

Board dts:
&m_can1 {
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_m_can1>;
	status = "enabled";
};
