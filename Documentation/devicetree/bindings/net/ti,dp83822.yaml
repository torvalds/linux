title: TI DP83822 ethernet PHY

description: |
  The DP83822 is a low-power, single-port, 10/100 Mbps Ethernet PHY. It
  provides all of the physical layer functions needed to transmit and receive
  data over standard, twisted-pair cables or to connect to an external,
  fiber-optic transceiver. Additionally, the DP83822 provides flexibility to
  connect to a MAC through a standard MII, RMII, or RGMII interface

  Specifications about the Ethernet PHY can be found at:

  ti,link-loss-low:
    type: boolean
    description: |
       DP83822 PHY in Fiber mode only.
       Sets the DP83822 to detect a link drop condition when the signal goes
       high.  If not set then link drop will occur when the signal goes low.
       This property is only applicable if the fiber mode support is strapped
       to on.

  ti,fiber-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
       DP83822 PHY only.
       If present the DP83822 PHY is configured to operate in fiber mode
       Fiber mode support can also be strapped. If the strap pin is not set
       correctly or not set at all then this boolean can be used to enable it.
       If the fiber mode is not strapped then signal detection for the PHY
       is disabled.
       In fiber mode, auto-negotiation is disabled and the PHY can only work in
       100base-fx (full and half duplex) modes.

  rx-internal-delay-ps:
    description: |
       DP83822 PHY only.
       Setting this property to a non-zero number sets the RX internal delay
       for the PHY.  The internal delay for the PHY is fixed to 3.5ns relative
       to receive data.

  tx-internal-delay-ps:
    description: |
       DP83822 PHY only.
       Setting this property to a non-zero number sets the TX internal delay
       for the PHY.  The internal delay for the PHY is fixed to 3.5ns relative
       to transmit data.
