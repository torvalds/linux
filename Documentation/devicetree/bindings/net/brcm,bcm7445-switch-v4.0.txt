* Broadcom Starfighter 2 integrated swich

Required properties:

- compatible: should be one of
	"brcm,bcm7445-switch-v4.0"
	"brcm,bcm7278-switch-v4.0"
	"brcm,bcm7278-switch-v4.8"
- reg: addresses and length of the register sets for the device, must be 6
  pairs of register addresses and lengths
- interrupts: interrupts for the devices, must be two interrupts
- #address-cells: must be 1, see dsa/dsa.txt
- #size-cells: must be 0, see dsa/dsa.txt

Deprecated binding required properties:

- dsa,mii-bus: phandle to the MDIO bus controller, see dsa/dsa.txt
- dsa,ethernet: phandle to the CPU network interface controller, see dsa/dsa.txt
- #address-cells: must be 2, see dsa/dsa.txt

Subnodes:

The integrated switch subnode should be specified according to the binding
described in dsa/dsa.txt.

Optional properties:

- reg-names: litteral names for the device base register addresses, when present
  must be: "core", "reg", "intrl2_0", "intrl2_1", "fcb", "acb"

- interrupt-names: litternal names for the device interrupt lines, when present
  must be: "switch_0" and "switch_1"

- brcm,num-gphy: specify the maximum number of integrated gigabit PHYs in the
  switch

- brcm,num-rgmii-ports: specify the maximum number of RGMII interfaces supported
  by the switch

- brcm,fcb-pause-override: boolean property, if present indicates that the switch
  supports Failover Control Block pause override capability

- brcm,acb-packets-inflight: boolean property, if present indicates that the switch
  Admission Control Block supports reporting the number of packets in-flight in a
  switch queue

- resets: a single phandle and reset identifier pair. See
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt for details.

- reset-names: If the "reset" property is specified, this property should have
  the value "switch" to denote the switch reset line.

Port subnodes:

Optional properties:

- brcm,use-bcm-hdr: boolean property, if present, indicates that the switch
  port has Broadcom tags enabled (per-packet metadata)

Example:

switch_top@f0b00000 {
	compatible = "simple-bus";
	#size-cells = <1>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	ranges = <0 0xf0b00000 0x40804>;

	ethernet_switch@0 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm7445-switch-v4.0";
		#size-cells = <0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x0 0x40000
			0x40000 0x110
			0x40340 0x30
			0x40380 0x30
			0x40400 0x34
			0x40600 0x208>;
		reg-names = "core", "reg", intrl2_0", "intrl2_1",
			    "fcb, "acb";
		interrupts = <0 0x18 0
				0 0x19 0>;
		brcm,num-gphy = <1>;
		brcm,num-rgmii-ports = <2>;
		brcm,fcb-pause-override;
		brcm,acb-packets-inflight;

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				label = "gphy";
				reg = <0>;
			};
		};
	};
};

Example using the old DSA DeviceTree binding:

switch_top@f0b00000 {
	compatible = "simple-bus";
	#size-cells = <1>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	ranges = <0 0xf0b00000 0x40804>;

	ethernet_switch@0 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm7445-switch-v4.0";
		#size-cells = <0>;
		#address-cells = <2>;
		reg = <0x0 0x40000
			0x40000 0x110
			0x40340 0x30
			0x40380 0x30
			0x40400 0x34
			0x40600 0x208>;
		interrupts = <0 0x18 0
				0 0x19 0>;
		brcm,num-gphy = <1>;
		brcm,num-rgmii-ports = <2>;
		brcm,fcb-pause-override;
		brcm,acb-packets-inflight;

		...
		switch@0 {
			reg = <0 0>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			#address-cells <1>;

			port@0 {
				label = "gphy";
				reg = <0>;
				brcm,use-bcm-hdr;
			};
			...
		};
	};
};
