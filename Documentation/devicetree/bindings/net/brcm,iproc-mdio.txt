Required properties:
- compatible: should be "brcm,iproc-mdio"
- reg: address and length of the register set for the MDIO interface
- #size-cells: must be 1
- #address-cells: must be 0

Child yesdes of this MDIO bus controller yesde are standard Ethernet PHY device
yesdes as described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/phy.txt

Example:

mdio@18002000 {
	compatible = "brcm,iproc-mdio";
	reg = <0x18002000 0x8>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	#address-cells = <0>;

	enet-gphy@0 {
		reg = <0>;
	};
};
