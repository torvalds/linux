    4xx/Axon EMAC ethernet nodes

    The EMAC ethernet controller in IBM and AMCC 4xx chips, and also
    the Axon bridge.  To operate this needs to interact with a this
    special McMAL DMA controller, and sometimes an RGMII or ZMII
    interface.  In addition to the nodes and properties described
    below, the node for the OPB bus on which the EMAC sits must have a
    correct clock-frequency property.

      i) The EMAC node itself

    Required properties:
    - device_type       : "network"

    - compatible        : compatible list, contains 2 entries, first is
			  "ibm,emac-CHIP" where CHIP is the host ASIC (440gx,
			  405gp, Axon) and second is either "ibm,emac" or
			  "ibm,emac4".  For Axon, thus, we have: "ibm,emac-axon",
			  "ibm,emac4"
    - interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for EMAC IRQ and WOL IRQ>
    - interrupt-parent  : optional, if needed for interrupt mapping
    - reg               : <registers mapping>
    - local-mac-address : 6 bytes, MAC address
    - mal-device        : phandle of the associated McMAL node
    - mal-tx-channel    : 1 cell, index of the tx channel on McMAL associated
			  with this EMAC
    - mal-rx-channel    : 1 cell, index of the rx channel on McMAL associated
			  with this EMAC
    - cell-index        : 1 cell, hardware index of the EMAC cell on a given
			  ASIC (typically 0x0 and 0x1 for EMAC0 and EMAC1 on
			  each Axon chip)
    - max-frame-size    : 1 cell, maximum frame size supported in bytes
    - rx-fifo-size      : 1 cell, Rx fifo size in bytes for 10 and 100 Mb/sec
			  operations.
			  For Axon, 2048
    - tx-fifo-size      : 1 cell, Tx fifo size in bytes for 10 and 100 Mb/sec
			  operations.
			  For Axon, 2048.
    - fifo-entry-size   : 1 cell, size of a fifo entry (used to calculate
			  thresholds).
			  For Axon, 0x00000010
    - mal-burst-size    : 1 cell, MAL burst size (used to calculate thresholds)
			  in bytes.
			  For Axon, 0x00000100 (I think ...)
    - phy-mode          : string, mode of operations of the PHY interface.
			  Supported values are: "mii", "rmii", "smii", "rgmii",
			  "tbi", "gmii", rtbi", "sgmii".
			  For Axon on CAB, it is "rgmii"
    - mdio-device       : 1 cell, required iff using shared MDIO registers
			  (440EP).  phandle of the EMAC to use to drive the
			  MDIO lines for the PHY used by this EMAC.
    - zmii-device       : 1 cell, required iff connected to a ZMII.  phandle of
			  the ZMII device node
    - zmii-channel      : 1 cell, required iff connected to a ZMII.  Which ZMII
			  channel or 0xffffffff if ZMII is only used for MDIO.
    - rgmii-device      : 1 cell, required iff connected to an RGMII. phandle
			  of the RGMII device node.
			  For Axon: phandle of plb5/plb4/opb/rgmii
    - rgmii-channel     : 1 cell, required iff connected to an RGMII.  Which
			  RGMII channel is used by this EMAC.
			  Fox Axon: present, whatever value is appropriate for each
			  EMAC, that is the content of the current (bogus) "phy-port"
			  property.

    Optional properties:
    - phy-address       : 1 cell, optional, MDIO address of the PHY. If absent,
			  a search is performed.
    - phy-map           : 1 cell, optional, bitmap of addresses to probe the PHY
			  for, used if phy-address is absent. bit 0x00000001 is
			  MDIO address 0.
			  For Axon it can be absent, though my current driver
			  doesn't handle phy-address yet so for now, keep
			  0x00ffffff in it.
    - phy-handle	: Used to describe configurations where a external PHY
			  is used. Please refer to:
			  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/ethernet.txt
    - rx-fifo-size-gige : 1 cell, Rx fifo size in bytes for 1000 Mb/sec
			  operations (if absent the value is the same as
			  rx-fifo-size).  For Axon, either absent or 2048.
    - tx-fifo-size-gige : 1 cell, Tx fifo size in bytes for 1000 Mb/sec
			  operations (if absent the value is the same as
			  tx-fifo-size). For Axon, either absent or 2048.
    - tah-device        : 1 cell, optional. If connected to a TAH engine for
			  offload, phandle of the TAH device node.
    - tah-channel       : 1 cell, optional. If appropriate, channel used on the
			  TAH engine.
    - fixed-link	: Fixed-link subnode describing a link to a non-MDIO
			  managed entity. See
			  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/fixed-link.txt
			  for details.
    - mdio subnode	: When the EMAC has a phy connected to its local
			  mdio, which us supported by the kernel's network
			  PHY library in drivers/net/phy, there must be device
			  tree subnode with the following required properties:
				- #address-cells: Must be <1>.
				- #size-cells: Must be <0>.

			  For PHY definitions: Please refer to
			  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/phy.txt and
			  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/ethernet.txt

      ii) McMAL node

    Required properties:
    - device_type        : "dma-controller"
    - compatible         : compatible list, containing 2 entries, first is
			   "ibm,mcmal-CHIP" where CHIP is the host ASIC (like
			   emac) and the second is either "ibm,mcmal" or

			   firmware.  We use the "delayed" interrupts for txeob
			   and rxeob. Thus we end up with mapping those 5 MPIC
			   interrupts, all level positive sensitive: 10, 11, 32,
			   33, 34 (in decimal)

    - compatible         : compatible list, containing 2 entries, first is
			   "ibm,zmii-CHIP" where CHIP is the host ASIC (like
