* Cadence MACB/GEM Ethernet controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "cdns,[<chip>-]{macb|gem}"
  Use "cdns,at91sam9260-macb" Atmel at91sam9260 and at91sam9263 SoCs.
  Use "cdns,at32ap7000-macb" for other 10/100 usage or use the generic form: "cdns,macb".
  Use "cnds,pc302-gem" for Picochip picoXcell pc302 and later devices based on
  the Cadence GEM, or the generic form: "cdns,gem".
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain macb interrupt
- phy-mode: String, operation mode of the PHY interface.
  Supported values are: "mii", "rmii", "gmii", "rgmii".

Optional properties:
- local-mac-address: 6 bytes, mac address

Examples:

	macb0: ethernet@fffc4000 {
		compatible = "cdns,at32ap7000-macb";
		reg = <0xfffc4000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <21>;
		phy-mode = "rmii";
		local-mac-address = [3a 0e 03 04 05 06];
	};
