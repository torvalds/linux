* Renesas Electronics SH EtherMAC

This file provides information on what the device node for the SH EtherMAC
interface contains.

Required properties:
- compatible: "renesas,gether-r8a7740" if the device is a part of R8A7740 SoC.
	      "renesas,ether-r8a7778"  if the device is a part of R8A7778 SoC.
	      "renesas,ether-r8a7779"  if the device is a part of R8A7779 SoC.
	      "renesas,ether-r8a7790"  if the device is a part of R8A7790 SoC.
	      "renesas,ether-r8a7791"  if the device is a part of R8A7791 SoC.
	      "renesas,ether-r7s72100" if the device is a part of R7S72100 SoC.
- reg: offset and length of (1) the E-DMAC/feLic register block (required),
       (2) the TSU register block (optional).
- interrupts: interrupt specifier for the sole interrupt.
- phy-mode: see ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- phy-handle: see ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- #address-cells: number of address cells for the MDIO bus, must be equal to 1.
- #size-cells: number of size cells on the MDIO bus, must be equal to 0.
- clocks: clock phandle and specifier pair.
- pinctrl-0: phandle, referring to a default pin configuration node.

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: the phandle for the interrupt controller that services
		    interrupts for this device.
- pinctrl-names: pin configuration state name ("default").
- renesas,no-ether-link: boolean, specify when a board does not provide a proper
			 Ether LINK signal.
- renesas,ether-link-active-low: boolean, specify when the Ether LINK signal is
				 active-low instead of normal active-high.

Example (Lager board):

	ethernet@ee700000 {
		compatible = "renesas,ether-r8a7790";
		reg = <0 0xee700000 0 0x400>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 162 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&mstp8_clks R8A7790_CLK_ETHER>;
		phy-mode = "rmii";
		phy-handle = <&phy1>;
		pinctrl-0 = <&ether_pins>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		renesas,ether-link-active-low;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		phy1: ethernet-phy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			interrupt-parent = <&irqc0>;
			interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
			pinctrl-0 = <&phy1_pins>;
			pinctrl-names = "default";
		};
	};
