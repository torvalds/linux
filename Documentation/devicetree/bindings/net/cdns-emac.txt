* Cadence EMAC Ethernet controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "cdns,[<chip>-]{emac}"
  Use "cdns,at91rm9200-emac" Atmel at91rm9200 SoC.
  or the generic form: "cdns,emac".
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain macb interrupt
- phy-mode: see ethernet.txt file in the same directory.

Examples:

	macb0: ethernet@fffc4000 {
		compatible = "cdns,at91rm9200-emac";
		reg = <0xfffc4000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <21>;
		phy-mode = "rmii";
		local-mac-address = [3a 0e 03 04 05 06];
	};
