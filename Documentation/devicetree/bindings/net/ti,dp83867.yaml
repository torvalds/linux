description: |
  The DP83867 device is a robust, low power, fully featured Physical Layer
  transceiver with integrated PMD sublayers to support 10BASE-Te, 100BASE-TX
  and 1000BASE-T Ethernet protocols.

  The DP83867 is designed for easy implementation of 10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet
  LANs. It interfaces directly to twisted pair media via an external
  transformer. This device interfaces directly to the MAC layer through the
  IEEE 802.3 Standard Media Independent Interface (MII), the IEEE 802.3 Gigabit
  Media Independent Interface (GMII) or Reduced GMII (RGMII).

  Specifications about the Ethernet PHY can be found at:
    https://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/dp83867ir

  ti,min-output-impedance:
    type: boolean
    description: |
       MAC Interface Impedance control to set the programmable output impedance
       to a minimum value (35 ohms).

  ti,max-output-impedance:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      MAC Interface Impedance control to set the programmable output impedance
      to a maximum value (70 ohms).
      Note: ti,min-output-impedance and ti,max-output-impedance are mutually
        exclusive. When both properties are present ti,max-output-impedance
        takes precedence.

  tx-fifo-depth:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#definitions/uint32
    description: |
       Transmitt FIFO depth see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h for values

  rx-fifo-depth:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#definitions/uint32
    description: |
       Receive FIFO depth see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h for values

  ti,clk-output-sel:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Muxing option for CLK_OUT pin.  See dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h
      for applicable values. The CLK_OUT pin can also be disabled by this
      property.  When omitted, the PHY's default will be left as is.

  ti,rx-internal-delay:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#definitions/uint32
    description: |
      RGMII Receive Clock Delay - see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h
      for applicable values. Required only if interface type is
      PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID or PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_RXID.

  ti,tx-internal-delay:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#definitions/uint32
    description: |
      RGMII Transmit Clock Delay - see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h
      for applicable values. Required only if interface type is
      PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID or PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_TXID.

        Note: If the interface type is PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII the TX/RX clock
          delays will be left at their default values, as set by the PHY's pin
          strapping. The default strapping will use a delay of 2.00 ns.  Thus
          PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII, by default, does not behave as RGMII with no
          internal delay, but as PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_RGMII_ID.  The device tree
          should use "rgmii-id" if internal delays are desired as this may be
          changed in future to cause "rgmii" mode to disable delays.

  ti,dp83867-rxctrl-strap-quirk:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This denotes the fact that the board has RX_DV/RX_CTRL pin strapped in
      mode 1 or 2. To ensure PHY operation, there are specific actions that
      software needs to take when this pin is strapped in these modes.
      See data manual for details.

  ti,sgmii-ref-clock-output-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This denotes which SGMII configuration is used (4 or 6-wire modes).
      Some MACs work with differential SGMII clock. See data manual for details.
