* VIA VT8500 and WonderMedia WM8xxx UART Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "via,vt8500-uart"

- reg: base physical address of the controller and length of memory mapped
	region.

- interrupts: hardware interrupt number

- clocks: shall be the input parent clock phandle for the clock. This should
	be the 24Mhz reference clock.

Aliases may be defined to ensure the correct ordering of the uarts.

Example:
	aliases {
		serial0 = &uart0;
	};

	uart0: serial@d8200000 {
		compatible = "via,vt8500-uart";
		reg = <0xd8200000 0x1040>;
		interrupts = <32>;
		clocks = <&clkuart0>;
	};
