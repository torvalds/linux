NVIDIA Tegra Hardware Synchronization Primitives (HSP)

The HSP modules are used for the processors to share resources and communicate
together. It provides a set of hardware synchronization primitives for
interprocessor communication. So the interprocessor communication (IPC)
protocols can use hardware synchronization primitives, when operating between
two processors not in an SMP relationship.

The features that HSP supported are shared mailboxes, shared semaphores,
arbitrated semaphores and doorbells.

Required properties:
- name : Should be hsp
- compatible
    Array of strings.
    one of:
    - "nvidia,tegra186-hsp"
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupt-names
    Array of strings.
    Contains a list of names for the interrupts described by the interrupt
    property. May contain the following entries, in any order:
    - "doorbell"
    Users of this binding MUST look up entries in the interrupt property
    by name, using this interrupt-names property to do so.
- interrupts
    Array of interrupt specifiers.
    Must contain one entry per entry in the interrupt-names property,
    in a matching order.
- #mbox-cells : Should be 2.

The mbox specifier of the "mboxes" property in the client node should
contain two data. The first one should be the HSP type and the second
one should be the ID that the client is going to use. Those information
can be found in the following file.

- <dt-bindings/mailbox/tegra186-hsp.h>.

Example:

hsp_top0: hsp@3c00000 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-hsp";
	reg = <0x0 0x03c00000 0x0 0xa0000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 176 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	interrupt-names = "doorbell";
	#mbox-cells = <2>;
};

client {
	...
	mboxes = <&hsp_top0 TEGRA_HSP_MBOX_TYPE_DB TEGRA_HSP_DB_MASTER_XXX>;
};
