description:
  The Inter-Processor Communication Controller (IPCC) is a centralized hardware
  to route interrupts across various subsystems. It involves a three-level
  addressing scheme called protocol, client and signal. For example, consider an
  entity on the Application Processor Subsystem (APSS) that wants to listen to
  Modem's interrupts via Shared Memory Point to Point (SMP2P) interface. In such
  a case, the client would be Modem (client-id is 2) and the signal would be
  SMP2P (signal-id is 2). The SMP2P itself falls under the Multiprocessor (MPROC)
  protocol (protocol-id is 0). Refer include/dt-bindings/mailbox/qcom-ipcc.h
  for the list of such IDs.

      The first cell is the client-id, and the second cell is the signal-id.
