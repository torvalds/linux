= EXAMPLE
The following example describes the APCS HMSS found in MSM8996 and part of the

	apcs_glb: mailbox@9820000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8996-apcs-hmss-global";
		reg = <0x9820000 0x1000>;

		#mbox-cells = <1>;
	};

	rpm-glink {
		compatible = "qcom,glink-rpm";

		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 168 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;

		qcom,rpm-msg-ram = <&rpm_msg_ram>;

		mboxes = <&apcs_glb 0>;
		mbox-names = "rpm_hlos";
