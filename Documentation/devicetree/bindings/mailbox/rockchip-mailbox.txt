Rockchip mailbox

The Rockchip mailbox is used by the Rockchip CPU cores to communicate
requests to MCU processor.

Refer to ./mailbox.txt for generic information about mailbox device-tree
bindings.

Required properties:

 - compatible: should be one of the following.
   - "rockchip,rk3368-mbox" for rk3368
 - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
	region.
	physical base address of the share buffer and length of memory mapped
	region.
 - interrupts: The interrupt number to the cpu. The interrupt specifier format
	depends on the interrupt controller.

Example:
        mbox: mbox@ff6b0000 {
                compatible = "rockchip,rk3368-mailbox";
                reg = <0x0 0xff6b0000 0x0 0x1000>,
                      <0x0 0xff8cf000 0x0 0x1000>; /* the end 4k of sram */
                interrupts = <GIC_SPI 146 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
                             <GIC_SPI 147 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
                             <GIC_SPI 148 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
                             <GIC_SPI 149 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
                #mbox-cells = <1>;
        };

        mbox_scpi: mbox-scpi {
                compatible = "rockchip,mbox-scpi";
                mboxes = <&mbox 0 &mbox 1>;
        };
