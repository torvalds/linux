  new-source-frs-typec-current:
    description: Initial current capability of the new source when vSafe5V
      is applied during PD3.0 Fast Role Swap. "Table 6-14 Fixed Supply PDO - Sink"
      of "USB Power Delivery Specification Revision 3.0, Version 1.2" provides the
      different power levels and "6.4.1.3.1.6 Fast Role Swap USB Type-C Current"
      provides a detailed description of the field. The sink PDO from current source
      reflects the current source's(i.e. transmitter of the FRS signal) power
      requirement during fr swap. The current sink (i.e. receiver of the FRS signal),
      a.k.a new source, should check if it will be able to satisfy the current source's,
      new sink's, requirement during frswap before enabling the frs signal reception.
      This property refers to maximum current capability that the current sink can
      satisfy. During FRS, VBUS voltage is at 5V, as the partners are in implicit
      contract, hence, the power level is only a function of the current capability.
      "1" refers to default USB power level as described by "Table 6-14 Fixed Supply PDO - Sink".
      "2" refers to 1.5A@5V.
      "3" refers to 3.0A@5V.

      state as defined in 7.4.2 Sink Electrical Parameters of USB Power Delivery Specification
      Revision 3.0, Version 1.2. When the property is set, the port requests pSnkStby(2.5W -
      5V@500mA) upon entering SNK_DISCOVERY(instead of 3A or the 1.5A, Rp current advertised, during
      SNK_DISCOVERY) and the actual currrent limit after reception of PS_Ready for PD link or during
      SNK_READY for non-pd link.
