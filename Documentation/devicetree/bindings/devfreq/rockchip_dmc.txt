* Rockchip DMC(Dynamic Memory Controller) device

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of the following.
  - "rockchip,px30-dmc" - for PX30 SoCs.
  - "rockchip,rk1808-dmc" - for RK1808 SoCs.
  - "rockchip,rk3128-dmc" - for RK3128 SoCs.
  - "rockchip,rk3228-dmc" - for RK3228 SoCs.
  - "rockchip,rk3288-dmc" - for RK3288 SoCs.
  - "rockchip,rk3308-dmc" - for RK3308 SoCs.
  - "rockchip,rk3328-dmc" - for RK3328 SoCs.
  - "rockchip,rk3368-dmc" - for RK3368 SoCs.
  - "rockchip,rk3399-dmc" - for RK3399 SoCs.
  - "rockchip,rk3568-dmc" - for RK3568 SoCs.
  - "rockchip,rk3588-dmc" - for RK3588 SoCs.
  - "rockchip,rv1126-dmc" - for RV1126 SoCs.
- devfreq-events: Node to get DDR loading, Refer to
		  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/devfreq/rockchip-dfi.txt
- interrupts: The interrupt number to the CPU. The interrupt specifier format
	      depends on the interrupt controller. It should be DCF interrupts,
	      when DDR dvfs finish, it will happen.
- clocks: Phandles for clock specified in "clock-names" property
- clock-names : The name of clock used by the DFI, must be "pclk_ddr_mon";
- operating-points-v2: Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/opp.txt
		       for details.
- center-supply: DMC supply node.
- status: Marks the node enabled/disabled.

Optional properties:
- ddr_timing:  DDR timing need to pass to arm trust firmware
- upthreshold: The upthreshold to simpleondeamnd policy
- downdifferential: The downdifferential to simpleondeamnd policy
- vop-bw-dmc-freq: The property is an array of 3-tuples items, and
		   each item consists of bandwidth and frequency like
		   <min-bandwidth max-bandwidth frequency>.
		   min-bandwidth: minimum ddr bandwidth in Mbyte/sec.
		   max-bandwidth: maximum ddr bandwidth in Mbyte/sec.
		   frequency: ddr frequency in KHz.
- #cooling-cells: This property indicates dmc can work as a cooling device
- ddr_power_model: Sets power model parameters.
	- dynamic-power-coefficient: A u32 value that represents the running time dynamic
	  power coefficient in units of mW/MHz/uVolt^2. The coefficient can either be
	  calculated from power measurements or derived by analysis.
	- static-power-coefficient: A u32 value that represents the static power
	  coefficient.
	- ts: An array containing coefficients for the temperature scaling factor.
	  Used as : tsf = ts[3]*T^3 + ts[2]*T^2 + ts[1]*T + ts[0], where T = temperature
	- thermal-zone: A string identifying the thermal zone used for the dmc
