description: |
  AXI3-bus is the main communication bus of Baikal-T1 SoC connecting all
  high-speed peripheral IP-cores with RAM controller and with MIPS P5600
  cores. Traffic arbitration is done by means of DW AXI Interconnect (so
  called AXI Main Interconnect) routing IO requests from one block to
  another: from CPU to SoC peripherals and between some SoC peripherals
  (mostly between peripheral devices and RAM, but also between DMA and
  some peripherals). In case of any protocol error, device not responding
  an IRQ is raised and a faulty situation is reported to the AXI EHB
  (Errors Handler Block) embedded on top of the DW AXI Interconnect and
  accessible by means of the Baikal-T1 System Controller.
