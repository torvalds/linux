* ARM Mali-300/400/450 GPU

Required properties:
- compatible:
	At least one of these: "arm,mali-300", "arm,mali-400", "arm,mali-450"
	Always: "arm,mali-utgard"
	Mali-450 can also include "arm,mali-400" as it is compatible.
	- "arm,mali-400", "arm,mali-utgard" for any Mali-400 GPU.
	- "arm,mali-450", "arm,mali-400", "arm,mali-utgard" for any Mali-450 GPU.
- reg:
	Physical base address and length of the GPU's registers.
- interrupts:
	- List of all Mali interrupts.
	- This list must match the number of and the order of entries in
		interrupt-names.
- interrupt-names:
	- IRQPP<X> - Name for PP interrupts.
	- IRQPPMMU<X> -  Name for interrupts from the PP MMU.
	- IRQPP - Name for the PP broadcast interrupt (Mali-450 only).
	- IRQGP - Name for the GP interrupt.
	- IRQGPMMU - Name for the interrupt from the GP MMU.
	- IRQPMU - Name for the PMU interrupt (If pmu is implemented in HW, it must be contained).

Optional properties:
- pmu_domain_config:
	- If the Mali internal PMU is present and the PMU IRQ is specified in
		interrupt/interrupt-names ("IRQPMU").This contains the mapping of
		Mali HW units to the PMU power domain.
	-Mali Dynamic power domain configuration in sequence from 0-11, like:
		<GP PP0 PP1 PP2 PP3  PP4 PP5 PP6 PP7 L2$0 L2$1 L2$2>.
- pmu-switch-delay:
	- Only needed if the power gates are connected to the PMU in a high fanout
		network. This value is the number of Mali clock cycles it takes to
		enable the power gates and turn on the power mesh. This value will
		have no effect if a daisy chain implementation is used.

Platform related properties:
- clocks: Phandle to clock for Mali utgard device.
- clock-names: the corresponding names of clock in clocks property.
- regulator: Phandle to regulator which is power supplier of mali device.

Example for a Mali400_MP1_PMU device:

/ {
	...

	gpu@12300000 {
		compatible = "arm,mali-400", "arm,mali-utgard";
		reg = <0x12300000 0x30000>;
		interrupts = <0 55 4>, <0 56 4>, <0 57 4>, <0 58 4>, <0 59 4>;
		interrupt-names = "IRQGP", "IRQGPMMU", "IRQPP0", "IRQPPMMU0", "IRQPMU";

		pmu_domain_config = <0x1 0x4 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x2 0x0 0x0>;
		pmu_switch_delay = <0xff>;
		clocks = <clock 122>, <clock 123>;
		clock-names = "mali_parent", "mali";
		vdd_g3d-supply = <regulator_Phandle>;
	};
}
