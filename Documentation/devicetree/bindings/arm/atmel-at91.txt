SHDWC SAMA5D2-Compatible Shutdown Controller

1) shdwc node

required properties:
- compatible: should be "atmel,sama5d2-shdwc".
- reg: should contain registers location and length
- clocks: phandle to input clock.

- debounce-delay-us: minimum wake-up inputs debouncer period in
  microseconds. It's usually a board-related property.
- atmel,wakeup-rtc-timer: boolean to enable Real-Time Clock wake-up.

The node contains child nodes for each wake-up input that the platform uses.

2) input nodes

Wake-up input nodes are usually described in the "board" part of the Device
Tree. Note also that input 0 is linked to the wake-up pin and is frequently
used.

Required properties:
- reg: should contain the wake-up input index [0 - 15].

Optional properties:
- atmel,wakeup-active-high: boolean, the corresponding wake-up input described
  by the child, forces the wake-up of the core power supply on a high level.
  The default is to be active low.

Example:

On the SoC side:
	shdwc@f8048010 {
		compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-shdwc";
		reg = <0xf8048010 0x10>;
		clocks = <&clk32k>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		atmel,wakeup-rtc-timer;
	};

On the board side:
	shdwc@f8048010 {
		debounce-delay-us = <976>;

		input@0 {
			reg = <0>;
		};

		input@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			atmel,wakeup-active-high;
		};
	};

Special Function Registers (SFR)

Special Function Registers (SFR) manage specific aspects of the integrated
memory, bridge implementations, processor and other functionality not controlled
elsewhere.

The Security Module macrocell provides all necessary secure functions to avoid
voltage, temperature, frequency and mechanical attacks on the chip. It also
embeds secure memories that can be scrambled
