Marvell Armada AP806 System Controller
======================================

The AP806 is one of the two core HW blocks of the Marvell Armada 7K/8K
SoCs. It contains a system controller, which provides a number
registers giving access to numerous features: clocks, pin-muxing and
many other SoC configuration items. This DT binding allows to describe
this system controller.

The Device Tree node representing the AP806 system controller provides
a number of clocks:

 - 0: clock of CPU cluster 0
 - 1: clock of CPU cluster 1
 - 2: fixed PLL at 1200 Mhz
 - 3: MSS clock, derived from the fixed PLL

Required properties:

 - compatible: must be:
     "marvell,ap806-system-controller", "syscon"
 - reg: register area of the AP806 system controller
 - #clock-cells: must be set to 1

Example:

	syscon: system-controller@6f4000 {
		compatible = "marvell,ap806-system-controller", "syscon";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x6f4000 0x1000>;
	};
