ARM Integrator/AP (Application Platform) and Integrator/CP (Compact Platform)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ARM's oldest Linux-supported platform with connectors for different core
tiles of ARMv4, ARMv5 and ARMv6 type.

Required properties (in root node):
	compatible = "arm,integrator-ap";  /* Application Platform */
	compatible = "arm,integrator-cp";  /* Compact Platform */

FPGA type interrupt controllers, see the versatile-fpga-irq binding doc.

Required nodes:

- core-module: the root node to the Integrator platforms must have
  a core-module with regs and the compatible string
  "arm,core-module-integrator"
- external-bus-interface: the root node to the Integrator platforms
  must have an external bus interface with regs and the
  compatible-string "arm,external-bus-interface"

  Required properties for the core module:
  - regs: the location and size of the core module registers, one
    range of 0x200 bytes.

- syscon: the root node of the Integrator platforms must have a
  system controller node pointong to the control registers,
  with the compatible string
  "arm,integrator-ap-syscon"
  "arm,integrator-cp-syscon"
  respectively.

  Required properties for the system controller:
  - regs: the location and size of the system controller registers,
    one range of 0x100 bytes.

  Required properties for the AP system controller:
  - interrupts: the AP syscon node must include the logical module
    interrupts, stated in order of module instance <module 0>,
    <module 1>, <module 2> ... for the CP system controller this
    is not required not of any use.

ARM Versatile Application and Platform Baseboards
-------------------------------------------------
ARM's development hardware platform with connectors for customizable
core tiles.  The hardware configuration of the Versatile boards is
highly customizable.

Required properties (in root node):
	compatible = "arm,versatile-ab";  /* Application baseboard */
	compatible = "arm,versatile-pb";  /* Platform baseboard */

Interrupt controllers:
- VIC required properties:
	compatible = "arm,versatile-vic";
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;

- SIC required properties:
	compatible = "arm,versatile-sic";
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;

Required nodes:

- core-module: the root node to the Versatile platforms must have
  a core-module with regs and the compatible strings
  "arm,core-module-versatile", "syscon"

ARM RealView Boards
-------------------
The RealView boards cover tailored evaluation boards that are used to explore
the ARM11 and Cortex A-8 and Cortex A-9 processors.

Required properties (in root node):
	/* RealView Emulation Baseboard */
	compatible = "arm,realview-eb";
	 /* RealView Platform Baseboard for ARM1176JZF-S */
	compatible = "arm,realview-pb1176";
	/* RealView Platform Baseboard for ARM11 MPCore */
	compatible = "arm,realview-pb11mp";
	/* RealView Platform Baseboard for Cortex A-8 */
	compatible = "arm,realview-pba8";
	/* RealView Platform Baseboard Explore for Cortex A-9 */
	compatible = "arm,realview-pbx";

Required nodes:

- soc: some node of the RealView platforms must be the SoC
  node that contain the SoC-specific devices, withe the compatible
  string set to one of these tuples:
   "arm,realview-eb-soc", "simple-bus"
   "arm,realview-pb1176-soc", "simple-bus"
   "arm,realview-pb11mp-soc", "simple-bus"
   "arm,realview-pba8-soc", "simple-bus"
   "arm,realview-pbx-soc", "simple-bus"

- syscon: some subnode of the RealView SoC node must be a
  system controller node pointing to the control registers,
  with the compatible string set to one of these tuples:
   "arm,realview-eb-syscon", "syscon"
   "arm,realview-pb1176-syscon", "syscon"
   "arm,realview-pb11mp-syscon", "syscon"
   "arm,realview-pba8-syscon", "syscon"
   "arm,realview-pbx-syscon", "syscon"

  Required properties for the system controller:
  - regs: the location and size of the system controller registers,
    one range of 0x1000 bytes.

Example:

/dts-v1/;
#include <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h>
#include "skeleton.dtsi"

/ {
	model = "ARM RealView PB1176 with device tree";
	compatible = "arm,realview-pb1176";

	soc {
		#address-cells = <1>;
