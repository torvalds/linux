  The ARM Versatile boards are two variants of ARM926EJ-S evaluation boards
  with various pluggable interface boards, in essence the Versatile PB version
  is a superset of the Versatile AB version.

  The root node in the Versatile platforms must contain a core module child
  node. They are always at physical address 0x10000000 in all the Versatile
  variants.

  When fitted with the IB2 Interface Board, the Versatile AB will present an
  optional system controller node which controls the extra peripherals on the
  interface board.

          evaluation board specifically for the ARM926EJ-S. It can be connected
          to an IB1 interface board for a touchscreen-type use case or an IB2
          for a candybar phone-type use case. See ARM DUI 0225D.
