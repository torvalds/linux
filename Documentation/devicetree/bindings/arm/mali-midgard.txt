* ARM Mali Midgard devices


Required properties:

- compatible : Should be mali<chip>, replacing digits with x from the back,
until malit<Major>xx, ending with arm,mali-midgard, the latter not optional.
- reg : Physical base address of the device and length of the register area.
- interrupts : Contains the three IRQ lines required by T-6xx devices
- interrupt-names : Contains the names of IRQ resources in the order they were
provided in the interrupts property. Must contain: "JOB, "MMU", "GPU".

Optional:

- clocks : Phandle to clock for the Mali T-6xx device.
- clock-names : Shall be "clk_mali".
- mali-supply : Phandle to regulator for the Mali device. Refer to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt for details.
- operating-points : Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/opp.txt
for details.
- jm_config : For T860/T880. Sets job manager configuration. An array containing:
	- 1 to override the TIMESTAMP value, 0 otherwise.
	- 1 to override clock gate, forcing them to be always on, 0 otherwise.
	- 1 to enable job throttle, limiting the number of cores that can be started
	  simultaneously, 0 otherwise.
	- Value between 0 and 63 (including). If job throttle is enabled, this is one
	  less than the number of cores that can be started simultaneously.
- power_model : Sets power model parameters. Note that this model was designed for the Juno
	        platform, and may not be suitable for other platforms. A structure containing :
	- compatible: Should be arm,mali-simple-power-model
	- dynamic-coefficient: Coefficient, in pW/(Hz V^2), which is multiplied
	  by v^2*f to calculate the dynamic power consumption.
	- static-coefficient: Coefficient, in uW/V^3, which is multiplied by
	  v^3 to calculate the static power consumption.
	- ts: An array containing coefficients for the temperature scaling
	  factor. This is used to scale the static power by a factor of
	  tsf/1000000, where tsf = ts[3]*T^3 + ts[2]*T^2 + ts[1]*T + ts[0],
	  and T = temperature in degrees.
	- thermal-zone: A string identifying the thermal zone used for the GPU
- system-coherency : Sets the coherency protocol to be used for coherent
		     accesses made from the GPU.
		     If not set then no coherency is used.
	- 0  : ACE-Lite
	- 1  : ACE
	- 31 : No coherency
- ipa-model : Sets the IPA model to be used for power management. GPU probe will fail if the
	      model is not found in the registered models list. If no model is specified here,
	      a gpu-id based model is picked if available, otherwise the default model is used.
	- mali-simple-power-model: Default model used on mali
- protected-mode-switcher : Phandle to device implemented protected mode switching functionality.
Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/smc-protected-mode-switcher.txt for one implementation.

Example for a Mali-T602:

gpu@0xfc010000 {
	compatible = "arm,malit602", "arm,malit60x", "arm,malit6xx", "arm,mali-midgard";
	reg = <0xfc010000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <0 36 4>, <0 37 4>, <0 38 4>;
	interrupt-names = "JOB", "MMU", "GPU";

	clocks = <&pclk_mali>;
	clock-names = "clk_mali";
	mali-supply = <&vdd_mali>;
	operating-points = <
		/* KHz   uV */
		533000 1250000,
		450000 1150000,
		400000 1125000,
		350000 1075000,
		266000 1025000,
		160000  925000,
		100000  912500,
	>;
	power_model {
		compatible = "arm,mali-simple-power-model";
		static-coefficient = <2427750>;
		dynamic-coefficient = <4687>;
		ts = <20000 2000 (-20) 2>;
		thermal-zone = "gpu";
	};
};
