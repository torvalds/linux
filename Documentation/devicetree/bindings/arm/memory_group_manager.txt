* Arm memory group manager for Mali GPU device drivers

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "arm,physical-memory-group-manager"

An example node:

        gpu_physical_memory_group_manager: physical-memory-group-manager {
                compatible = "arm,physical-memory-group-manager";
        };

It must be referenced by the GPU as well, see physical-memory-group-manager:

	gpu: gpu@0x6e000000 {
		compatible = "arm,mali-midgard";
		reg = <0x0 0x6e000000 0x0 0x200000>;
		interrupts = <0 168 4>, <0 168 4>, <0 168 4>;
		interrupt-names = "JOB", "MMU", "GPU";
		clocks = <&scpi_dvfs 2>;
		clock-names = "clk_mali";
		system-coherency = <31>;
		physical-memory-group-manager = <&gpu_physical_memory_group_manager>;
		operating-points = <
			/* KHz uV */
			50000 820000
		>;
	};
