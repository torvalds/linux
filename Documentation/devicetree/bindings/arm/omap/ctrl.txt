OMAP Control Module bindings

Control Module contains miscellaneous features under it based on SoC type.
Pincontrol is one common feature, and it has a specialized support
described in [1]. Typically some clock nodes are also under control module.
Syscon is used to share register level access to drivers external to
control module driver itself.

See [2] for documentation about clock/clockdomain nodes.
