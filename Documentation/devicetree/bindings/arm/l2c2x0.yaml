title: ARM L2 Cache Controller

description: |+
  ARM cores often have a separate L2C210/L2C220/L2C310 (also known as PL210/
  PL220/PL310 and variants) based level 2 cache controller. All these various
  implementations of the L2 cache controller have compatible programming
  models (Note 1). Some of the properties that are just prefixed "cache-*" are
  taken from section 3.7.3 of the Devicetree Specification which can be found
  at:
  https://www.devicetree.org/specifications/

  Note 1: The description in this document doesn't apply to integrated L2
    cache controllers as found in e.g. Cortex-A15/A7/A57/A53. These
    integrated L2 controllers are assumed to be all preconfigured by
    early secure boot code. Thus no need to deal with their configuration
    in the kernel at all.
