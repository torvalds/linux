NXP i.MX System Controller Firmware (SCFW)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The System Controller Firmware (SCFW) is a low-level system function
which runs on a dedicated Cortex-M core to provide power, clock, and
resource management. It exists on some i.MX8 processors. e.g. i.MX8QM
(QM, QP), and i.MX8QX (QXP, DX).

The AP communicates with the SC using a multi-ported MU module found
in the LSIO subsystem. The current definition of this MU module provides
5 remote AP connections to the SC to support up to 5 execution environments
(TZ, HV, standard Linux, etc.). The SC side of this MU module interfaces
with the LSIO DSC IP bus. The SC firmware will communicate with this MU
using the MSI bus.

System Controller Device Node:
============================================================

The scu node with the following properties shall be under the /firmware/ node.

Required properties:
-------------------
- compatible:	should be "fsl,imx-scu".
- mbox-names:	should include "tx0", "tx1", "tx2", "tx3",
			       "rx0", "rx1", "rx2", "rx3";
		include "gip3" if want to support general MU interrupt.
- mboxes:	List of phandle of 4 MU channels for tx, 4 MU channels for
		rx, and 1 optional MU channel for general interrupt.
		All MU channels must be in the same MU instance.
		Cross instances are not allowed. The MU instance can only
		be one of LSIO MU0~M4 for imx8qxp and imx8qm. Users need
		to make sure use the one which is not conflict with other
		execution environments. e.g. ATF.
		Note:
		Channel 0 must be "tx0" or "rx0".
		Channel 1 must be "tx1" or "rx1".
		Channel 2 must be "tx2" or "rx2".
		Channel 3 must be "tx3" or "rx3".
		General interrupt rx channel must be "gip3".
		e.g.
		mboxes = <&lsio_mu1 0 0
			  &lsio_mu1 0 1
			  &lsio_mu1 0 2
			  &lsio_mu1 0 3
			  &lsio_mu1 1 0
			  &lsio_mu1 1 1
			  &lsio_mu1 1 2
			  &lsio_mu1 1 3
			  &lsio_mu1 3 3>;
		See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/fsl,mu.txt
		for detailed mailbox binding.

Note: Each mu which supports general interrupt should have an alias correctly
numbered in "aliases" node.
e.g.
aliases {
	mu1 = &lsio_mu1;
};

i.MX SCU Client Device Node:
============================================================

Client nodes are maintained as children of the relevant IMX-SCU device node.

Power domain bindings based on SCU Message Protocol
------------------------------------------------------------

This binding for the SCU power domain providers uses the generic power
domain binding[2].

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be one of:
			  "fsl,imx8qm-scu-pd",
			  "fsl,imx8qxp-scu-pd"
			followed by "fsl,scu-pd"

- #power-domain-cells:	Must be 1. Contains the Resource ID used by
			SCU commands.
			See detailed Resource ID list from:
			include/dt-bindings/firmware/imx/rsrc.h

Clock bindings based on SCU Message Protocol
------------------------------------------------------------

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be one of:
			  "fsl,imx8qm-clock"
			  "fsl,imx8qxp-clock"
			followed by "fsl,scu-clk"
- #clock-cells:		Should be 1. Contains the Clock ID value.
- clocks:		List of clock specifiers, must contain an entry for
			each required entry in clock-names
- clock-names:		Should include entries "xtal_32KHz", "xtal_24MHz"

The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
ID in its "clocks" phandle cell.

See the full list of clock IDs from:
include/dt-bindings/clock/imx8qxp-clock.h

Pinctrl bindings based on SCU Message Protocol
------------------------------------------------------------

This binding uses the i.MX common pinctrl binding[3].

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be one of:
			"fsl,imx8qm-iomuxc",
			"fsl,imx8qxp-iomuxc".

Required properties for Pinctrl sub nodes:
- fsl,pins:		Each entry consists of 3 integers which represents
			the mux and config setting for one pin. The first 2
			integers <pin_id mux_mode> are specified using a
			PIN_FUNC_ID macro, which can be found in
			<dt-bindings/pinctrl/pads-imx8qm.h>,
			<dt-bindings/pinctrl/pads-imx8qxp.h>.
			The last integer CONFIG is the pad setting value like
			pull-up on this pin.

			Please refer to i.MX8QXP Reference Manual for detailed
			CONFIG settings.

RTC bindings based on SCU Message Protocol
------------------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "fsl,imx8qxp-sc-rtc";

OCOTP bindings based on SCU Message Protocol
------------------------------------------------------------
Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be one of:
			"fsl,imx8qm-scu-ocotp",
			"fsl,imx8qxp-scu-ocotp".
- #address-cells:	Must be 1. Contains byte index
- #size-cells:		Must be 1. Contains byte length

Optional Child nodes:

- Data cells of ocotp:
  Detailed bindings are described in bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Watchdog bindings based on SCU Message Protocol
------------------------------------------------------------

              "fsl,imx8qxp-sc-wdt"
              followed by "fsl,imx-sc-wdt";
