      signal is fed into the PMC. This signal is optionally inverted, and
      then fed into the ARM GIC. The PMC is not involved in the detection
      or handling of this interrupt signal, merely its inversion.

      The AVP (Audio-Video Processor) is an ARM7 processor and
      always being the first boot processor when chip is power on
      or resume from deep sleep mode. When the system is resumed
      from the deep sleep mode, the warm boot code will restore
      some PLLs, clocks and then brings up CPU0 for resuming the
      system.

  powergates:
    type: object
    description: |
      This node contains a hierarchy of power domain nodes, which should
      match the powergates on the Tegra SoC. Each powergate node
      represents a power-domain on the Tegra SoC that can be power-gated
      by the Tegra PMC.
      Hardware blocks belonging to a power domain should contain
      "power-domains" property that is a phandle pointing to corresponding
      powergate node.
      The name of the powergate node should be one of the below. Note that
      not every powergate is applicable to all Tegra devices and the following
      list shows which powergates are applicable to which devices.
      Please refer to Tegra TRM for mode details on the powergate nodes to
      use for each power-gate block inside Tegra.

    description:
      This is a Pad configuration node. On Tegra SOCs a pad is a set of
      pins which are configured as a group. The pin grouping is a fixed
      attribute of the hardware. The PMC can be used to set pad power state
      and signaling voltage. A pad can be either in active or power down mode.
      The support for power state and signaling voltage configuration varies
      depending on the pad in question. 3.3V and 1.8V signaling voltages
      are supported on pins where software controllable signaling voltage
      switching is available.

      The pad configuration state nodes are placed under the pmc node and they
      are referred to by the pinctrl client properties. For more information
      see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt.
      The pad name should be used as the value of the pins property in pin
      configuration nodes.

      The following pads are present on Tegra124 and Tegra132
      audio, bb, cam, comp, csia, csb, cse, dsi, dsib, dsic, dsid, hdmi, hsic,

      The following pads are present on Tegra210
      audio, audio-hv, cam, csia, csib, csic, csid, csie, csif, dbg,

          The values are defined in
          include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-tegra-io-pad.h.
          Power state can be configured on all Tegra124 and Tegra132
          pads. None of the Tegra124 or Tegra132 pads support signaling
          voltage switching.
          All of the listed Tegra210 pads except pex-cntrl support power
          state configuration. Signaling voltage switching is supported
          on below Tegra210 pads.
