NVIDIA Tegra20 MC(Memory Controller)

Required properties:
- compatible : "nvidia,tegra20-mc"
- reg : Should contain 2 register ranges(address and length); see the
  example below. Note that the MC registers are interleaved with the
  GART registers, and hence must be represented as multiple ranges.
- interrupts : Should contain MC General interrupt.

Example:
	memory-controller@7000f000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-mc";
		reg = <0x7000f000 0x024
		       0x7000f03c 0x3c4>;
		interrupts = <0 77 0x04>;
	};
