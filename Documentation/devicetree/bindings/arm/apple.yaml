description: |
  ARM platforms using SoCs designed by Apple Inc., branded "Apple Silicon".

  This currently includes devices based on the "M1" SoC:

  - Mac mini (M1, 2020)
  - MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020)
  - MacBook Air (M1, 2020)
  - iMac (24-inch, M1, 2021)

  And devices based on the "M1 Pro" and "M1 Max" SoCs:

  - MacBook Pro (14-inch, M1 Pro, 2021)
  - MacBook Pro (14-inch, M1 Max, 2021)
  - MacBook Pro (16-inch, M1 Pro, 2021)
  - MacBook Pro (16-inch, M1 Max, 2021)

  The compatible property should follow this format:

  compatible = "apple,<targettype>", "apple,<socid>", "apple,arm-platform";

  <targettype> represents the board/device and comes from the `target-type`
  property of the root node of the Apple Device Tree, lowercased. It can be
  queried on macOS using the following command:

  $ ioreg -d2 -l | grep target-type

  <socid> is the lowercased SoC ID. Apple uses at least *five* different
  names for their SoCs:

  - Marketing name ("M1")
  - Internal name ("H13G")
  - Codename ("Tonga")
  - SoC ID ("T8103")
  - Package/IC part number ("APL1102")

  Devicetrees should use the lowercased SoC ID, to avoid confusion if
  multiple SoCs share the same marketing name. This can be obtained from
  the `compatible` property of the arm-io node of the Apple Device Tree,
  which can be queried as follows on macOS:

  $ ioreg -n arm-io | grep compatible
