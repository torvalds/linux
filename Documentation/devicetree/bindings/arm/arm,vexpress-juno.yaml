description: |+
  ARM's Versatile Express platform were built as reference designs for exploring
  multicore Cortex-A class systems. The Versatile Express family contains both
  32 bit (Aarch32) and 64 bit (Aarch64) systems.

  The board consist of a motherboard and one or more daughterboards (tiles). The
  motherboard provides a set of peripherals. Processor and RAM "live" on the
  tiles.

  The motherboard and each core tile should be described by a separate Device
  Tree source file, with the tile's description including the motherboard file
  using an include directive. As the motherboard can be initialized in one of
  two different configurations ("memory maps"), care must be taken to include
  the correct one.

  When a new generation of boards were introduced under the name "Juno", these
  shared to many common characteristics with the Versatile Express that the
  "arm,vexpress" compatible was retained in the root node, and these are
  included in this binding schema as well.

  The root node indicates the CPU SoC on the core tile, and this
  is a daughterboard to the main motherboard. The name used in the compatible
  string shall match the name given in the core tile's technical reference
  manual, followed by "arm,vexpress" as an additional compatible value. If
  further subvariants are released of the core tile, even more fine-granular
  compatible strings with up to three compatible strings are used.
