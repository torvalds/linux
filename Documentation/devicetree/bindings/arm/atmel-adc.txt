* AT91's Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "atmel,<chip>-adc"
    <chip> can be "at91sam9260", "at91sam9g45" or "at91sam9x5"
  - reg: Should contain ADC registers location and length
  - interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the ADC
  - atmel,adc-channels-used: Bitmask of the channels muxed and enable for this
    device
  - atmel,adc-startup-time: Startup Time of the ADC in microseconds as
    defined in the datasheet
  - atmel,adc-vref: Reference voltage in millivolts for the conversions
  - atmel,adc-res: List of resolution in bits supported by the ADC. List size
		   must be two at least.
  - atmel,adc-res-names: Contains one identifier string for each resolution
			 in atmel,adc-res property. "lowres" and "highres"
			 identifiers are required.

Optional properties:
  - atmel,adc-use-external: Boolean to enable of external triggers
  - atmel,adc-use-res: String corresponding to an identifier from
		       atmel,adc-res-names property. If not specified, the highest
		       resolution will be used.
  - atmel,adc-sleep-mode: Boolean to enable sleep mode when no conversion
  - atmel,adc-sample-hold-time: Sample and Hold Time in microseconds
 
Optional trigger Nodes:
  - Required properties:
    * trigger-name: Name of the trigger exposed to the user
    * trigger-value: Value to put in the Trigger register
      to activate this trigger
  - Optional properties:
    * trigger-external: Is the trigger an external trigger?
