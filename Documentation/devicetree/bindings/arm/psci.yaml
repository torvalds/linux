title: Power State Coordination Interface (PSCI)

description: |+
  Firmware implementing the PSCI functions described in ARM document number
  ARM DEN 0022A ("Power State Coordination Interface System Software on ARM
  processors") can be used by Linux to initiate various CPU-centric power
  operations.

  Issue A of the specification describes functions for CPU suspend, hotplug
  and migration of secure software.

  Functions are invoked by trapping to the privilege level of the PSCI
  firmware (specified as part of the binding below) and passing arguments
  in a manner similar to that specified by AAPCS:

     r0       => 32-bit Function ID / return value
    {r1 - r3}	=> Parameters

  Note that the immediate field of the trapping instruction must be set
  to #0.

      Device tree nodes that require usage of PSCI CPU_SUSPEND function (ie
      idle state nodes with entry-method property is set to "psci", as per
      bindings in [1]) must specify this property.

    description: |
      ARM systems can have multiple cores, sometimes in an hierarchical
      arrangement. This often, but not always, maps directly to the processor
      power topology of the system. Individual nodes in a topology have their
      own specific power states and can be better represented hierarchically.

      For these cases, the definitions of the idle states for the CPUs and the
      CPU topology, must conform to the binding in [3]. The idle states
      themselves must conform to the binding in [4] and must specify the
      arm,psci-suspend-param property.

      It should also be noted that, in PSCI firmware v1.0 the OS-Initiated
      (OSI) CPU suspend mode is introduced. Using a hierarchical representation
      helps to implement support for OSI mode and OS implementations may choose
      to mandate it.
