title: Allwinner Memory Bus (MBUS) controller

description: |
  The MBUS controller drives the MBUS that other devices in the SoC
  will use to perform DMA. It also has a register interface that
  allows to monitor and control the bandwidth and priorities for
  masters on that bus.

  Each device having to perform their DMA through the MBUS must have
  the interconnects and interconnect-names properties set to the MBUS
  controller and with "dma-mem" as the interconnect name.

properties:
  "#interconnect-cells":
    const: 1
    description:
      The content of the cell is the MBUS ID.

  compatible:
    enum:
      - allwinner,sun5i-a13-mbus
      - allwinner,sun8i-h3-mbus
      - allwinner,sun50i-a64-mbus

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  clocks:
    maxItems: 1

  dma-ranges:
    description:
      See section 2.3.9 of the DeviceTree Specification.
