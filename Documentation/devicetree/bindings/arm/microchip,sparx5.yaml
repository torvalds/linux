   The Microchip Sparx5 SoC is a ARMv8-based used in a family of
   gigabit TSN-capable gigabit switches.

   The SparX-5 Ethernet switch family provides a rich set of switching
   features such as advanced TCAM-based VLAN and QoS processing
   enabling delivery of differentiated services, and security through
   TCAM-based frame processing using versatile content aware processor
   (VCAP)
