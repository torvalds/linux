description: |
  Texas Instrument's processors including those belonging to Keystone generation
  of processors have separate hardware entity which is now responsible for the
  management of the System on Chip (SoC) system. These include various system
  level functions as well.

  An example of such an SoC is K2G, which contains the system control hardware
  block called Power Management Micro Controller (PMMC). This hardware block is
  initialized early into boot process and provides services to Operating Systems
  on multiple processors including ones running Linux.

  See http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/TISCI for protocol definition.

  The TI-SCI node describes the Texas Instrument's System Controller entity node.
  This parent node may optionally have additional children nodes which describe
  specific functionality such as clocks, power domain, reset or additional
  functionality as may be required for the SoC. This hierarchy also describes the
  relationship between the TI-SCI parent node to the child node.
