description: |
  The TI K3 family of SoCs usually have a central System Controller Processor
  that is responsible for managing various SoC-level resources like clocks,
  resets, interrupts etc. The communication with that processor is performed
  through the TI-SCI protocol.

  Each specific device management node like a clock controller node, a reset
  controller node or an interrupt-controller node should define a common set
  of properties that enables them to implement the corresponding functionality
  over the TI-SCI protocol. The following are some of the common properties
  needed by such individual nodes. The required properties for each device
  management node is defined in the respective binding.

properties:
  ti,sci:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/phandle
    description:
      Should be a phandle to the TI-SCI System Controller node

  ti,sci-dev-id:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Should contain the TI-SCI device id corresponding to the device. Please
      refer to the corresponding System Controller documentation for valid
      values for the desired device.

  ti,sci-proc-ids:
    description: Should contain a single tuple of <proc_id host_id>.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32-array
    items:
      - description: TI-SCI processor id for the remote processor device
      - description: TI-SCI host id to which processor control ownership
                     should be transferred to
