description: |
  LLCC (Last Level Cache Controller) provides last level of cache memory in SoC,
  that can be shared by multiple clients. Clients here are different cores in the
  SoC, the idea is to minimize the local caches at the clients and migrate to
  common pool of memory. Cache memory is divided into partitions called slices
  which are assigned to clients. Clients can query the slice details, activate
  and deactivate them.
