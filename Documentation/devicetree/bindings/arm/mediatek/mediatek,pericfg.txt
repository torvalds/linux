Mediatek pericfg controller
===========================

The Mediatek pericfg controller provides various clocks and reset
outputs to the system.

Required Properties:

- compatible: Should be:
	- "mediatek,mt8135-pericfg", "syscon"
	- "mediatek,mt8173-pericfg", "syscon"
- #clock-cells: Must be 1
- #reset-cells: Must be 1

The pericfg controller uses the common clk binding from
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
The available clocks are defined in dt-bindings/clock/mt*-clk.h.
Also it uses the common reset controller binding from
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt.
The available reset outputs are defined in
dt-bindings/reset-controller/mt*-resets.h

Example:

pericfg: power-controller@10003000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-pericfg", "syscon";
	reg = <0 0x10003000 0 0x1000>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	#reset-cells = <1>;
};
