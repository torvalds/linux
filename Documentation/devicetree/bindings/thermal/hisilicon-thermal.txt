* Temperature Sensor on hisilicon SoCs

** Required properties :

- compatible: "hisilicon,tsensor".
- reg: physical base address of thermal sensor and length of memory mapped
  region.
- interrupt: The interrupt number to the cpu. Defines the interrupt used
  by /SOCTHERM/tsensor.
- clock-names: Input clock name, should be 'thermal_clk'.
- clocks: phandles for clock specified in "clock-names" property.
- #thermal-sensor-cells: Should be 1. See ./thermal.txt for a description.

Example :

for Hi6220:
	tsensor: tsensor@0,f7030700 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,tsensor";
		reg = <0x0 0xf7030700 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 7 0x4>;
		clocks = <&sys_ctrl HI6220_TSENSOR_CLK>;
		clock-names = "thermal_clk";
		#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;
	}

for Hi3660:
	tsensor: tsensor@fff30000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi3660-tsensor";
		reg = <0x0 0xfff30000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 145 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;
	};
