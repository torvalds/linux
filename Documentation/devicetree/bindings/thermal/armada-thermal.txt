* Marvell Armada 370/375/380/XP thermal management

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be set to one of the following:
    * marvell,armada370-thermal
    * marvell,armada375-thermal
    * marvell,armada380-thermal
    * marvell,armadaxp-thermal
    * marvell,armada-ap806-thermal
    * marvell,armada-ap807-thermal
    * marvell,armada-cp110-thermal

Note: these bindings are deprecated for AP806/CP110 and should instead
follow the rules described in:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/marvell/ap80x-system-controller.txt
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/marvell/cp110-system-controller.txt

- reg: Device's register space.
  Two entries are expected, see the examples below. The first one points
  to the status register (4B). The second one points to the control
  registers (8B).
  Note: The compatibles marvell,armada370-thermal,
  marvell,armada380-thermal, and marvell,armadaxp-thermal must point to
  "control MSB/control 1", with size of 4 (deprecated binding), or point
  to "control LSB/control 0" with size of 8 (current binding). All other
  compatibles must point to "control LSB/control 0" with size of 8.

Examples:

	/* Legacy bindings */
	thermal@d0018300 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada370-thermal";
		reg = <0xd0018300 0x4
		       0xd0018304 0x4>;
	};

	ap_thermal: thermal@6f8084 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-ap806-thermal";
		reg = <0x6f808C 0x4>,
		      <0x6f8084 0x8>;
	};
