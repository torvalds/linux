description: The SOCTHERM IP block contains thermal sensors, support for
  polled or interrupt-based thermal monitoring, CPU and GPU throttling based
  on temperature trip points, and handling external overcurrent notifications.
  It is also used to manage emergency shutdown in an overheating situation.

      When present, this property specifies the temperature at which the
      SOCTHERM hardware will assert the thermal trigger signal to the Power
      Management IC, which can be configured to reset or shutdown the device.
      It is an array of pairs where each pair represents a tsensor ID followed
      by a temperature in milli Celcius. In the absence of this property the
      critical trip point will be used for thermtrip temperature.

      Note:
      - the "critical" type trip points will be used to set the temperature at
        which the SOCTHERM hardware will assert a thermal trigger if the
        "nvidia,thermtrips" property is missing.  When the thermtrips property
        is present, the breach of a critical trip point is reported back to
        the thermal framework to implement software shutdown.

      - the "hot" type trip points will be set to SOCTHERM hardware as the
        throttle temperature.  Once the temperature of this thermal zone is
        higher than it, it will trigger the HW throttle event.
