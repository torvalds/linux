* ST UVIS25 uv sensor

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "st,uvis25"
- reg: i2c address of the sensor / spi cs line

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
- interrupts: interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
  flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH, IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING, IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW or
  IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING.

  Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic interrupt
  client node bindings.

Example:

uvis25@47 {
	compatible = "st,uvis25";
	reg = <0x47>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
};
