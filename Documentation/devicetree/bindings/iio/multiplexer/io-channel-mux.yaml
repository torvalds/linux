title: I/O channel multiplexer bindings

description: |
  If a multiplexer is used to select which hardware signal is fed to
  e.g. an ADC channel, these bindings describe that situation.

  For each non-empty string in the channels property, an io-channel will be
  created. The number of this io-channel is the same as the index into the list
  of strings in the channels property, and also matches the mux controller
  state. The mux controller state is described in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mux/mux-controller.yaml

properties:

  compatible:
    const: io-channel-mux

  io-channels:
    maxItems: 1
    description: Channel node of the parent channel that has multiplexed input.

  io-channel-names:
    const: parent

  mux-controls: true
  mux-control-names: true

  channels:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/string-array
    description:
      List of strings, labeling the mux controller states.
