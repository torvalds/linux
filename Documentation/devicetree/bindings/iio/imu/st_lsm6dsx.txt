* ST_LSM6DSx driver for STM 6-axis (acc + gyro) imu Mems sensors

Required properties:
- compatible: must be one of:
  "st,lsm6ds3"
  "st,lsm6ds3h"
  "st,lsm6dsl"
  "st,lsm6dsm"
  "st,ism330dlc"
- reg: i2c address of the sensor / spi cs line

Optional properties:
- st,drdy-int-pin: the pin on the package that will be used to signal
  "data ready" (valid values: 1 or 2).
- drive-open-drain: the interrupt/data ready line will be configured
  as open drain, which is useful if several sensors share the same
  interrupt line. This is a boolean property.
  (This binding is taken from pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt)
  If the requested interrupt is configured as IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH or
  IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING a pull-down resistor is needed to drive the line
  when it is not active, whereas a pull-up one is needed when interrupt
  line is configured as IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW or IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING.
- interrupt-parent: should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
- interrupts: interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
  flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH, IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING, IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW or
  IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING.

  Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic interrupt
  client node bindings.

Example:

lsm6dsm@6b {
	compatible = "st,lsm6dsm";
	reg = <0x6b>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
};
