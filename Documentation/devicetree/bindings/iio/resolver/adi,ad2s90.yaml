    description: |
      Chip's max frequency, as specified in its datasheet, is 2Mhz. But a 600ns
      delay is expected between the application of a logic LO to CS and the
      application of SCLK, as also specified. And since the delay is not
      implemented in the spi code, to satisfy it, SCLK's period should be at
      most 2 * 600ns, so the max frequency should be 1 / (2 * 6e-7), which gives
      roughly 830000Hz.
