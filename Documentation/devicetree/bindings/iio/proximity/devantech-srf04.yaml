description: |
  Bit-banging driver using two GPIOs:
  - trigger-gpio is raised by the driver to start sending out an ultrasonic
    burst
  - echo-gpio is held high by the sensor after sending ultrasonic burst
    until it is received once again

  Specifications about the driver can be found at:

  trig-gpios:
    description:
      Definition of the GPIO for the triggering (output) This GPIO is set
      for about 10 us by the driver to tell the device it should initiate
      the measurement cycle.

  echo-gpios:
    description:
      Definition of the GPIO for the echo (input)
      This GPIO is set by the device as soon as an ultrasonic burst is sent
      out and reset when the first echo is received.
      Thus this GPIO is set while the ultrasonic waves are doing one round
      trip.
      It needs to be an GPIO which is able to deliver an interrupt because
      the time between two interrupts is measured in the driver.
      See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt for information
      on how to specify a consumer gpio.
