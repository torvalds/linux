STMicroelectronics STM32 DFSDM ADC device driver


STM32 DFSDM ADC is a sigma delta analog-to-digital converter dedicated to
interface external sigma delta modulators to STM32 micro controllers.
It is mainly targeted for:
- Sigma delta modulators (motor control, metering...)
- PDM microphones (audio digital microphone)

It features up to 8 serial digital interfaces (SPI or Manchester) and
up to 4 filters on stm32h7.

Each child node match with a filter instance.

Contents of a STM32 DFSDM root node:
------------------------------------
Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "st,stm32h7-dfsdm".
- reg: Offset and length of the DFSDM block register set.
- clocks: IP and serial interfaces clocking. Should be set according
		to rcc clock ID and "clock-names".
- clock-names: Input clock name "dfsdm" must be defined,
		"audio" is optional. If defined CLKOUT is based on the audio
		clock, else "dfsdm" is used.
- #interrupt-cells = <1>;
- #address-cells = <1>;
- #size-cells = <0>;

Optional properties:
- spi-max-frequency: Requested only for SPI master mode.
		  SPI clock OUT frequency (Hz). This clock must be set according
		  to "clock" property. Frequency must be a multiple of the rcc
		  clock frequency. If not, SPI CLKOUT frequency will not be
		  accurate.
- pinctrl-names:	Set to "default".
- pinctrl-0:		List of phandles pointing to pin configuration
			nodes to set pins in mode of operation for dfsdm
			on external pin.

Contents of a STM32 DFSDM child nodes:
--------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be:
	"st,stm32-dfsdm-adc" for sigma delta ADCs
	"st,stm32-dfsdm-dmic" for audio digital microphone.
- reg: Specifies the DFSDM filter instance used.
- interrupts: IRQ lines connected to each DFSDM filter instance.
- st,adc-channels:	List of single-ended channels muxed for this ADC.
			valid values:
				"st,stm32h7-dfsdm" compatibility: 0 to 7.
- st,adc-channel-names:	List of single-ended channel names.
- st,filter-order:  SinC filter order from 0 to 5.
			0: FastSinC
			[1-5]: order 1 to 5.
			For audio purpose it is recommended to use order 3 to 5.
- #io-channel-cells = <1>: See the IIO bindings section "IIO consumers".

Required properties for "st,stm32-dfsdm-adc" compatibility:
- io-channels: From common IIO binding. Used to pipe external sigma delta
		modulator or internal ADC output to DFSDM channel.
		This is not required for "st,stm32-dfsdm-pdm" compatibility as
		PDM microphone is binded in Audio DT node.

Required properties for "st,stm32-dfsdm-pdm" compatibility:
- #sound-dai-cells: Must be set to 0.
- dma: DMA controller phandle and DMA request line associated to the
		filter instance (specified by the field "reg")
- dma-names: Must be "rx"

Optional properties:
- st,adc-channel-types:	Single-ended channel input type.
			- "SPI_R": SPI with data on rising edge (default)
			- "SPI_F": SPI with data on falling edge
			- "MANCH_R": manchester codec, rising edge = logic 0, falling edge = logic 1
			- "MANCH_F": manchester codec, rising edge = logic 1, falling edge = logic 0
- st,adc-channel-clk-src: Conversion clock source.
			  - "CLKIN": external SPI clock (CLKIN x)
			  - "CLKOUT": internal SPI clock (CLKOUT) (default)
			  - "CLKOUT_F": internal SPI clock divided by 2 (falling edge).
			  - "CLKOUT_R": internal SPI clock divided by 2 (rising edge).

- st,adc-alt-channel: Must be defined if two sigma delta modulator are
			  connected on same SPI input.
			  If not set, channel n is connected to SPI input n.
			  If set, channel n is connected to SPI input n + 1.

- st,filter0-sync: Set to 1 to synchronize with DFSDM filter instance 0.
		   Used for multi microphones synchronization.

Example of a sigma delta adc connected on DFSDM SPI port 0
and a pdm microphone connected on DFSDM SPI port 1:

	ads1202: simple_sd_adc@0 {
		compatible = "ads1202";
		#io-channel-cells = <1>;
	};

	dfsdm: dfsdm@40017000 {
		compatible = "st,stm32h7-dfsdm";
		reg = <0x40017000 0x400>;
		clocks = <&rcc DFSDM1_CK>;
		clock-names = "dfsdm";
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		dfsdm_adc0: filter@0 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-dfsdm-adc";
			#io-channel-cells = <1>;
			reg = <0>;
			interrupts = <110>;
			st,adc-channels = <0>;
			st,adc-channel-names = "sd_adc0";
			st,adc-channel-types = "SPI_F";
			st,adc-channel-clk-src = "CLKOUT";
			io-channels = <&ads1202 0>;
			st,filter-order = <3>;
		};
		dfsdm_pdm1: filter@1 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-dfsdm-dmic";
			reg = <1>;
			interrupts = <111>;
			dmas = <&dmamux1 102 0x400 0x00>;
			dma-names = "rx";
			st,adc-channels = <1>;
			st,adc-channel-names = "dmic1";
			st,adc-channel-types = "SPI_R";
			st,adc-channel-clk-src = "CLKOUT";
			st,filter-order = <5>;
		};
