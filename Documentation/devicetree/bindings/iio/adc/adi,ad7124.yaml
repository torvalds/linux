  rdy-gpios:
    description:
      GPIO reading the R̅D̅Y̅ line. Having such a GPIO is technically optional but
      highly recommended because DOUT/R̅D̅Y̅ toggles during SPI transfers (in its
      DOUT aka MISO role) and so usually triggers a spurious interrupt. The
      distinction between such a spurious event and a real one can only be done
      by reading such a GPIO. (There is a register telling the same
      information, but accessing that one needs a SPI transfer which then
      triggers another interrupt event.)
