  Bindings for the Analog Devices AD7280a Battery Monitoring System.
  Used in devices such as hybrid electric cars, battery backup and power tools.
  Multiple chips can be daisy chained and accessed via a single SPI interface.
  Data sheet found here:
    https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD7280A.pdf

properties:
  compatible:
    const: adi,ad7280a

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  interrupts:
    description: IRQ line for the ADC
    maxItems: 1

  spi-max-frequency: true

  adi,voltage-alert-last-chan:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      Allows limiting of scope of which channels are considered for voltage
      alerts, typically because not all are wired to anything. Only applies to
      last device in the daisy chain.
    default: 5
    enum: [3, 4, 5]

  adi,acquisition-time-ns:
    description:
      Additional time may be needed to charge the sampling capacitors depending
      on external writing.
    default: 400
    enum: [400, 800, 1200, 1600]

  adi,thermistor-termination:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Enable the thermistor termination function.
