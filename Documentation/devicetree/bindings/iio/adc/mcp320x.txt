* Microchip Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)

The node for this driver must be a child node of a SPI controller, hence
all mandatory properties described in

        Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

must be specified.

Required properties:
	- compatible:  	Must be one of the following, depending on the
			model:
				"mcp3001" (DEPRECATED)
				"mcp3002" (DEPRECATED)
				"mcp3004" (DEPRECATED)
				"mcp3008" (DEPRECATED)
				"mcp3201" (DEPRECATED)
				"mcp3202" (DEPRECATED)
				"mcp3204" (DEPRECATED)
				"mcp3208" (DEPRECATED)
				"mcp3301" (DEPRECATED)

				"microchip,mcp3001"
				"microchip,mcp3002"
				"microchip,mcp3004"
				"microchip,mcp3008"
				"microchip,mcp3201"
				"microchip,mcp3202"
				"microchip,mcp3204"
				"microchip,mcp3208"
				"microchip,mcp3301"

			NOTE: The use of the compatibles with no vendor prefix
			is deprecated and only listed because old DT use them.

Examples:
spi_controller {
	mcp3x0x@0 {
		compatible = "mcp3002";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
	};
};
