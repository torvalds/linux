title: ADC on an STMPE multifunction device.

maintainers:

description:
  This ADC forms part of an ST microelectronics STMPE multifunction device .
  The ADC is shared with the STMPE touchscreen. As a result some ADC related
  settings are specified in the parent node.
  The node should be a child node of the stmpe node to which it belongs.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: st,stmpe-adc

  st,norequest-mask:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      Bitmask specifying which ADC channels should _not_ be
      requestable due to different usage (e.g. touch).

  - compatible

examples:
  - |
    adc {

        st,norequest-mask = <0x0f>; /* dont use ADC CH3-0 */
