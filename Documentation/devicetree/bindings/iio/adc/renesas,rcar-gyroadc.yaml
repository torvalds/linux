description: |
  The GyroADC block is a reduced SPI block with up to 8 chipselect lines,
  which supports the SPI protocol of a selected few SPI ADCs. The SPI ADCs
  are sampled by the GyroADC block in a round-robin fashion and the result
  presented in the GyroADC registers.
  The ADC bindings should match with that of the devices connected to a
  full featured SPI bus.

          fujitsu,mb88101a
          - Fujitsu MB88101A compatible mode,
            12bit sampling, up to 4 channels can be sampled in round-robin
            fashion. One Fujitsu chip supplies four GyroADC channels with
            data as it contains four ADCs on the chip and thus for 4-channel
            operation, single MB88101A is required. The Cx chipselect lines
            of the MB88101A connect directly to two CHS lines of the GyroADC,
            no demuxer is required. The data out line of each MB88101A
            connects to a shared input pin of the GyroADC.
          ti,adcs7476 or ti,adc121 or adi,ad7476
          - TI ADCS7476 / TI ADC121 / ADI AD7476 compatible mode, 15bit
            sampling, up to 8 channels can be sampled in round-robin
            fashion. One TI/ADI chip supplies single ADC channel with data,
            thus for 8-channel operation, 8 chips are required.
            A 3:8 chipselect demuxer is  required to connect the nCS line
            of the TI/ADI chips to the GyroADC, while MISO line of each
            TI/ADI ADC connects to a shared input pin of the GyroADC.
          maxim,max1162 or maxim,max11100
          - Maxim MAX1162 / Maxim MAX11100 compatible mode,  16bit sampling,
            up to 8 channels can be sampled in round-robin fashion. One
            Maxim chip supplies single ADC channel with data, thus for
            8-channel operation, 8 chips are required.
            A 3:8 chipselect demuxer is required to connect the nCS line
            of the MAX chips to the GyroADC, while MISO line of each Maxim
            ADC connects to a shared input pin of the GyroADC.
