description: |
  The ad7780 is a sigma-delta analog to digital converter. This driver provides
  reading voltage values and status bits from both the ad778x and ad717x series.
  Its interface also allows writing on the FILTER and GAIN GPIO pins on the
  ad778x.

  Specifications on the converters can be found at:

  powerdown-gpios:
    description:
      Must be the device tree identifier of the PDRST pin. If
      specified, it will be asserted during driver probe. As the

    description:
      Must be the device tree identifier of the GAIN pin. Only for
      the ad778x chips. If specified, it will be asserted during
      driver probe. As the line is active low, it should be marked
      GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW.
