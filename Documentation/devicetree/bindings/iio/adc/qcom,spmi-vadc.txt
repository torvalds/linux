- qcom,ratiometric:
    Usage: optional
    Value type: <empty>
    Definition: Channel calibration type.
            - For compatible property "qcom,spmi-vadc", if this property is
              specified VADC will use the VDD reference (1.8V) and GND for
              channel calibration. If property is not found, channel will be
              calibrated with 0.625V and 1.25V reference channels, also
              known as absolute calibration.
            - For compatible property "qcom,spmi-adc5" and "qcom,spmi-adc-rev2",
              if this property is specified VADC will use the VDD reference
              (1.875V) and GND for channel calibration. If property is not found,
              channel will be calibrated with 0V and 1.25V reference channels,
              also known as absolute calibration.

    Definition: Time between AMUX getting configured and the ADC starting
            conversion. The 'hw_settle_time' is an index used from valid values
            and programmed in hardware to achieve the hardware settling delay.
            - For compatible property "qcom,spmi-vadc" and "qcom,spmi-adc-rev2",
              Delay = 100us * (hw_settle_time) for hw_settle_time < 11,

- qcom,avg-samples:
    Usage: optional
    Value type: <u32>
    Definition: Number of samples to be used for measurement.
            Averaging provides the option to obtain a single measurement
            from the ADC that is an average of multiple samples. The value

NOTE:

For compatible property "qcom,spmi-vadc" following channels, also known as
reference point channels, are used for result calibration and their channel
configuration nodes should be defined:
VADC_REF_625MV and/or VADC_SPARE1(based on PMIC version) VADC_REF_1250MV,
VADC_GND_REF and VADC_VDD_VADC.

Example:

	/* VADC node */
	pmic_vadc: vadc@3100 {
		compatible = "qcom,spmi-vadc";

		interrupts = <0x0 0x31 0x0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
