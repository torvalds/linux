* st_lsm6ds3 driver for imu MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lsm6ds3"
              "st,lsm6ds33"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index
- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 1000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- interrupts: interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
              flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH.

              Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic interrupt
              client node bindings.

- st,module_id: module identifier.
                This is used by user-space to identify which devices
                are part of the same module (particularly important for
                supporting multiple sensors of the same type).

Example for an spi device node:

lsm6ds3-imu@0 {
	compatible = "st,lsm6ds3";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	st,module_id = <5>;
};
