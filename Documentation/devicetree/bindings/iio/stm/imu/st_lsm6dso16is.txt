* st_lsm6dso16is driver for imu MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lsm6dso16is"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index

- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 1000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry.

Optional properties  for all bus drivers:
- vdd-supply:        an optional regulator that needs to be on to provide VDD
                     power to the sensor.

- vddio-supply:      an optional regulator that needs to be on to provide the
                     VDD IO power to the sensor.

- mount-matrix:      mount rotation matrix.
                     Refer to iio/mount-matrix.txt for details.

- enable-sensor-hub: enable i2c master interface. Default is disabled.

- drive-pullup-shub: enable pullup on master i2c line.

Example for an spi device node on CS0:

lsm6dso16is-imu@0 {
	compatible = "st,lsm6dso16is";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
	vddio-supply = <&sensors_vddio>;
	vdd-supply = <&sensors_vdd>;
	mount-matrix = "1", "0", "0",
		       "0", "1", "0",
		       "0", "0", "1";
	drive-pullup-shub;
};

Example for an i2c device node when SA0 tied to ground:

lsm6dso16is@6a {
	compatible = "st,lsm6dso16is";
	reg = <0x6a>;
	vddio-supply = <&sensors_vddio>;
	vdd-supply = <&sensors_vdd>;
	mount-matrix = "1", "0", "0",
		       "0", "1", "0",
		       "0", "0", "1";
	drive-pullup-shub;
};
