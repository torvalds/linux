* st_lsm6dsvx driver for imu MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be "st,lsm6dsv16x"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg:               i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index

- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 1000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- vdd-supply:        an optional regulator that needs to be on to provide VDD
                     power to the sensor.

- vddio-supply:      an optional regulator that needs to be on to provide the
                     VDD IO power to the sensor.

- st,int-pin:        the pin on the package that will be used to signal
                     "data ready" (valid values: 1 or 2, default: 1).

- mount-matrix:      mount rotation matrix.

                     Refer to iio/mount-matrix.txt for details.

- drive-open-drain:  the interrupt/data ready line will be configured as open drain,
                     which is useful if several sensors share the same interrupt line.

- drive-pullup-shub: enable pull up on the i2c master interface. Default is disabled.

- interrupts:        interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
                     flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH, IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING,
                     IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW or IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING.

                     Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic interrupt
                     client node bindings.

Example for an spi device node:

lsm6dsvx-imu@0 {
	compatible = "st,lsm6dsv16x";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	vddio-supply = <&sensors_vddio>;
	vdd-supply = <&sensors_vdd>;
	st,int-pin = <1>;
	mount-matrix = "1", "0", "0",
		       "0", "1", "0",
		       "0", "0", "1";
};

Example for an i2c device node (SA0 connected to ground):

lsm6dsvx-imu@6a {
	compatible = "st,lsm6dsv16x";
	reg = <0x6a>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	vddio-supply = <&sensors_vddio>;
	vdd-supply = <&sensors_vdd>;
	st,int-pin = <1>;
	mount-matrix = "1", "0", "0",
		       "0", "1", "0",
		       "0", "0", "1";
};
