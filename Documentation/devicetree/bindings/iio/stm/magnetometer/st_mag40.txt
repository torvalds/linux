* st_mag40 driver for magnetometer MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lsm303ah_magn"
              "st,lsm303agr_magn"
              "st,lis2mdl_magn"
              "st,ism303dac_magn"
              "st,iis2mdc_magn"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index
- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 1000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- interrupts:   interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
                flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH.

                Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
                interrupt client node bindings.

- st,module_id: module identifier.
                If a sensor is supported by two different drivers (for example
                accel by this driver and magn by mag40 driver), module_id
                should be used by both drivers and should have the same id.
                This is used by user-space to identify which devices
                are part of the same module (particularly important for
                supporting multiple sensors of the same type).

Example for an spi device node:

lsm303ah-magn@0 {
	compatible = "st,lsm303ah_magn";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	st,module_id = <1>;
};
