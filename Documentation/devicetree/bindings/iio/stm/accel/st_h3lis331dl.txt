* h3lis331dl driver for accel MEMS sensors

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- compatible:        must be one of:
                     "st,h3lis331dl"
                     "st,lis331dlh"

- reg:               the chipselect index

- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 10000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties:
- st,drdy-int-pin:  the pin on the package that will be used to signal
                    "data ready" (valid values: 1 or 2, default: 1).

- interrupts:       interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
                    flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH.

                    Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
                    interrupt client node bindings.

- drive-open-drain: interrupt pin open drain setting (valid values: 0 or 1,
                    default: 0).

Example for an i2c device node:

h3lis331dl@18 {
        compatible = "st,lis331dlh-accel";
        reg = <0x18>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
        interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        st,drdy-int-pin = <1>;
};

Example for an spi device node:

h3lis331dl-accel@0 {
        compatible = "st,h3lis331dl";
        reg = <0x0>;
        spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
        interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
        interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        st,drdy-int-pin = <1>;
};
