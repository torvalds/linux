* lis2du12 driver for accel MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lis2du12"

Required properties for the i2c/i3c bindings:
- reg: i2c/i3c address of the sensor (for i3c is the static sddress)

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index
- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 1000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- st,int-pin:  the pin on the package that will be used to signal when
	       sensor data are available (valid values: 1 or 2, default: 1).

- interrupts:  interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
               flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH.

               Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
               interrupt client node bindings.

- pd_dis_int1: disable pull down on int1 pin.

- pp_od_int:   set int pin to open drain.

Example for an spi device node:

lis2du12-accel@0 {
	compatible = "st,lis2du12";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	st,int-pin = <1>;
};
