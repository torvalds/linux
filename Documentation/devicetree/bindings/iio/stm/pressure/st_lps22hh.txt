* st_lps22hh driver for pressure MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lps22ch"
              "st,lps22hh"
              "st,lps27hhw"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index
- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 1000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- interrupts: interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
              flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH, IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING,
              IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW or IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING.

              Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic interrupt
              client node bindings.

Example for an spi device node:

lps22hh-pressure@0 {
	compatible = "st,lps22hh";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
};
