* st_lps22df driver for pressure MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lps22df"
              "st,lps28dfw"

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index
- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 1000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- interrupts:     interrupt mapping for IRQ. It should be configured with
                  flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH, IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING,
                  IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW or IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING.

                  Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic
                  interrupt client node bindings.
- int-active-low: set device int pin active low (default active high)
- int-open-drain: set device int pin open in drain configuration (default
                  is push pull)

Example for an spi device node:

lps22df-pressure@0 {
	compatible = "st,lps22df";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
};

Example for an i2c device node:

lps28dfw-pressure@5c {
	compatible = "st,lps28dfw";
	reg = <0x5c>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
};
