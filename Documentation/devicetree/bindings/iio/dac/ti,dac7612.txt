* Texas Instruments Dual, 12-Bit Serial Input Digital-to-Analog Converter

The DAC7612 is a dual, 12-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with guaranteed
12-bit monotonicity performance over the industrial temperature range.
Is is programmable through an SPI interface.

The internal DACs are loaded when the LOADDACS pin is pulled down.
