  reg:

  vdd-supply:
    description: |
      Provides both power and acts as the reference supply on the mcp4725.
      For the mcp4726 it will be used as the reference voltage if vref-supply
      is not provided.

  vref-supply:
    description:
      Vref pin is used as a voltage reference when this supply is specified.

  microchip,vref-buffered:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable buffering of the external Vref pin. This boolean is not valid
      without the vref-supply. Quoting the datasheet: This is offered in
      cases where the reference voltage does not have the current
      capability not to drop its voltage when connected to the internal
      resistor ladder circuit.
