STMicroelectronics STM32 DAC

The STM32 DAC is a 12-bit voltage output digital-to-analog converter. The DAC
may be configured in 8 or 12-bit mode. It has two output channels, each with
its own converter.
It has built-in noise and triangle waveform generator and supports external
triggers for conversions. The DAC's output buffer allows a high drive output
current.

Contents of a stm32 dac root node:
-----------------------------------
Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "st,stm32h7-dac-core".
- reg: Offset and length of the device's register set.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for pclk (which feeds the peripheral bus
  interface)
- clock-names: Must be "pclk".
- vref-supply: Phandle to the vref+ input analog reference supply.
- #address-cells = <1>;
- #size-cells = <0>;

Optional properties:
- resets: Must contain the phandle to the reset controller.
- A pinctrl state named "default" for each DAC channel may be defined to set
  DAC_OUTx pin in mode of operation for analog output on external pin.

Contents of a stm32 dac child node:
-----------------------------------
DAC core node should contain at least one subnode, representing a
DAC instance/channel available on the machine.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "st,stm32-dac".
- reg: Must be either 1 or 2, to define (single) channel in use
- #io-channel-cells = <1>: See the IIO bindings section "IIO consumers" in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/iio-bindings.txt

Example:
	dac: dac@40007400 {
		compatible = "st,stm32h7-dac-core";
		reg = <0x40007400 0x400>;
		clocks = <&clk>;
		clock-names = "pclk";
		vref-supply = <&reg_vref>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&dac_out1 &dac_out2>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		dac1: dac@1 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-dac";
			#io-channels-cells = <1>;
			reg = <1>;
		};

		dac2: dac@2 {
			compatible = "st,stm32-dac";
			#io-channels-cells = <1>;
			reg = <2>;
		};
	};
