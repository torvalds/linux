  clocks:
    description:
      In general the core supports three types of clocks. bus_early is a
      SoC Bus Clock (AHB/AXI/Native). ref generates ITP when the UTMI/ULPI
      PHY is suspended. suspend clocks a small part of the USB3 core when
      SS PHY in P3. But particular cases may differ from that having less
      or more clock sources with another names.
