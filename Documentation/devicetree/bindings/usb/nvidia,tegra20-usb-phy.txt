Tegra SOC USB PHY

The device node for Tegra SOC USB PHY:

Required properties :
 - compatible : Should be "nvidia,tegra<chip>-usb-phy".
 - reg : Defines the following set of registers, in the order listed:
   - The PHY's own register set.
     Always present.
   - The register set of the PHY containing the UTMI pad control registers.
     Present if-and-only-if phy_type == utmi.
 - phy_type : Should be one of "utmi", "ulpi" or "hsic".
 - clocks : Defines the clocks listed in the clock-names property.
 - clock-names : The following clock names must be present:
   - reg: The clock needed to access the PHY's own registers. This is the
     associated EHCI controller's clock. Always present.
   - pll_u: PLL_U. Always present.
   - timer: The timeout clock (clk_m). Present if phy_type == utmi.
   - utmi-pads: The clock needed to access the UTMI pad control registers.
     Present if phy_type == utmi.
   - ulpi-link: The clock Tegra provides to the ULPI PHY (cdev2).
     Present if phy_type == ulpi, and ULPI link mode is in use.
 - resets : Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
   See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
 - reset-names : Must include the following entries:
   - usb: The PHY's own reset signal.
   - utmi-pads: The reset of the PHY containing the chip-wide UTMI pad control
     registers. Required even if phy_type == ulpi.

Required properties for phy_type == ulpi:
  - nvidia,phy-reset-gpio : The GPIO used to reset the PHY.

Required PHY timing params for utmi phy, for all chips:
  - nvidia,hssync-start-delay : Number of 480 Mhz clock cycles to wait before
    start of sync launches RxActive
  - nvidia,elastic-limit : Variable FIFO Depth of elastic input store
  - nvidia,idle-wait-delay : Number of 480 Mhz clock cycles of idle to wait
    before declare IDLE.
  - nvidia,term-range-adj : Range adjusment on terminations
  - Either one of the following for HS driver output control:
    - nvidia,xcvr-setup : integer, uses the provided value.
    - nvidia,xcvr-setup-use-fuses : boolean, indicates that the value is read
      from the on-chip fuses
    If both are provided, nvidia,xcvr-setup-use-fuses takes precedence.
  - nvidia,xcvr-lsfslew : LS falling slew rate control.
  - nvidia,xcvr-lsrslew :  LS rising slew rate control.

Required PHY timing params for utmi phy, only on Tegra30 and above:
  - nvidia,xcvr-hsslew : HS slew rate control.
  - nvidia,hssquelch-level : HS squelch detector level.
  - nvidia,hsdiscon-level : HS disconnect detector level.

Optional properties:
  - nvidia,has-legacy-mode : boolean indicates whether this controller can
    operate in legacy mode (as APX 2500 / 2600). In legacy mode some
    registers are accessed through the APB_MISC base address instead of
    the USB controller.
  - nvidia,is-wired : boolean. Indicates whether we can do certain kind of power
    optimizations for the devices that are always connected. e.g. modem.
  - dr_mode : dual role mode. Indicates the working mode for the PHY. Can be
    "host", "peripheral", or "otg". Defaults to "host" if not defined.
      host means this is a host controller
      peripheral means it is device controller
      otg means it can operate as either ("on the go")
  - nvidia,has-utmi-pad-registers : boolean indicates whether this controller
    contains the UTMI pad control registers common to all USB controllers.

VBUS control (required for dr_mode == otg, optional for dr_mode == host):
  - vbus-supply: regulator for VBUS
