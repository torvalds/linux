OMAP GLUE AND OTHER OMAP SPECIFIC COMPONENTS

OMAP MUSB GLUE
 - compatible : Should be "ti,omap4-musb" or "ti,omap3-musb"
 - ti,hwmods : must be "usb_otg_hs"
 - multipoint : Should be "1" indicating the musb controller supports
   multipoint. This is a MUSB configuration-specific setting.
 - num-eps : Specifies the number of endpoints. This is also a
   MUSB configuration-specific setting. Should be set to "16"
 - ram-bits : Specifies the ram address size. Should be set to "12"
 - interface-type : This is a board specific setting to describe the type of
   interface between the controller and the phy. It should be "0" or "1"
   specifying ULPI and UTMI respectively.
 - mode : Should be "3" to represent OTG. "1" signifies HOST and "2"
   represents PERIPHERAL.
 - power : Should be "50". This signifies the controller can supply up to
   100mA when operating in host mode.
 - usb-phy : the phandle for the PHY device
 - phys : the phandle for the PHY device (used by generic PHY framework)
 - phy-names : the names of the PHY corresponding to the PHYs present in the
   *phy* phandle.

Optional properties:
 - ctrl-module : phandle of the control module this glue uses to write to
   mailbox

SOC specific device node entry
usb_otg_hs: usb_otg_hs@4a0ab000 {
	compatible = "ti,omap4-musb";
	ti,hwmods = "usb_otg_hs";

	ram-bits = <12>;
	ctrl-module = <&omap_control_usb>;

};

Board specific device node entry
&usb_otg_hs {
	interface-type = <1>;
	mode = <3>;
	power = <50>;
};

OMAP DWC3 GLUE
 - compatible : Should be "ti,dwc3"
 - ti,hwmods : Should be "usb_otg_ss"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device.
 - interrupts : The irq number of this device that is used to interrupt the
   MPU
 - #address-cells, #size-cells : Must be present if the device has sub-nodes
 - utmi-mode : controls the source of UTMI/PIPE status for VBUS and OTG ID.
   It should be set to "1" for HW mode and "2" for SW mode.
 - ranges: the child address space are mapped 1:1 onto the parent address space

Optional Properties:
 - extcon : phandle for the extcon device omap dwc3 uses to detect
   connect/disconnect events.
 - vbus-supply : phandle to the regulator device tree node if needed.

Sub-nodes:
The dwc3 core should be added as subnode to omap dwc3 glue.
- dwc3 :
   The binding details of dwc3 can be found in:
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/dwc3.txt
