description: |-
  HD3SS3220 is a USB SuperSpeed (SS) 2:1 mux with DRP port controller. The device provides Channel
  Configuration (CC) logic and 5V VCONN sourcing for ecosystems implementing USB Type-C. The
  HD3SS3220 can be configured as a Downstream Facing Port (DFP), Upstream Facing Port (UFP) or a
  Dual Role Port (DRP) making it ideal for any application.
