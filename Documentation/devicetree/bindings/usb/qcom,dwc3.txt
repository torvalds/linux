Qualcomm SuperSpeed DWC3 USB SoC controller

Required properties:
- compatible:		Compatible list, contains
			"qcom,dwc3"
			"qcom,msm8996-dwc3" for msm8996 SOC.
			"qcom,sdm845-dwc3" for sdm845 SOC.
- reg:			Offset and length of register set for QSCRATCH wrapper
- power-domains:	specifies a phandle to PM domain provider node
- clocks:		A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs for the
				clocks listed in clock-names
- clock-names:		Should contain the following:
  "core"		Master/Core clock, have to be >= 125 MHz for SS
				operation and >= 60MHz for HS operation
  "mock_utmi"		Mock utmi clock needed for ITP/SOF generation in
				host mode. Its frequency should be 19.2MHz.
  "sleep"		Sleep clock, used for wakeup when USB3 core goes
				into low power mode (U3).

Optional clocks:
  "iface"		System bus AXI clock.
			Not present on "qcom,msm8996-dwc3" compatible.
  "cfg_noc"		System Config NOC clock.
			Not present on "qcom,msm8996-dwc3" compatible.
- assigned-clocks:	Should be:
				MOCK_UTMI_CLK
				MASTER_CLK
- assigned-clock-rates: Should be:
                                19.2Mhz (192000000) for MOCK_UTMI_CLK
                                >=125Mhz (125000000) for MASTER_CLK in SS mode
                                >=60Mhz (60000000) for MASTER_CLK in HS mode

Optional properties:
- resets:		Phandle to reset control that resets core and wrapper.
- interrupts:		specifies interrupts from controller wrapper used
			to wakeup from low power/susepnd state.	Must contain
			one or more entry for interrupt-names property
- interrupt-names:	Must include the following entries:
			- "hs_phy_irq": The interrupt that is asserted when a
			   wakeup event is received on USB2 bus
			- "ss_phy_irq": The interrupt that is asserted when a
			   wakeup event is received on USB3 bus
			- "dm_hs_phy_irq" and "dp_hs_phy_irq": Separate
			   interrupts for any wakeup event on DM and DP lines
- qcom,select-utmi-as-pipe-clk: if present, disable USB3 pipe_clk requirement.
				Used when dwc3 operates without SSPHY and only
				HS/FS/LS modes are supported.

Required child node:
A child node must exist to represent the core DWC3 IP block. The name of
the node is not important. The content of the node is defined in dwc3.txt.
