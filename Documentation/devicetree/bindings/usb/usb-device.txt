Generic USB Device Properties

Usually, we only use device tree for hard wired USB device.
The reference binding doc is from:
http://www.devicetree.org/open-firmware/bindings/usb/usb-1_0.ps

Required properties:
- compatible: "usbVID,PID", where VID is the vendor id and PID the product id.
  The textual representation of VID and PID shall be in lower case hexadecimal
  with leading zeroes suppressed. The other compatible strings from the above
  standard binding could also be used, but a device adhering to this binding
  may leave out all except for "usbVID,PID".
- reg: the port number which this device is connecting to, the range
  is 1-255.

Example:

&usb1 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	hub@1 {
		compatible = "usb5e3,608";
		reg = <1>;
	};
};
