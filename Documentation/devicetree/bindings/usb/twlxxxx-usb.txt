USB COMPARATOR OF TWL CHIPS

TWL6030 USB COMPARATOR
 - compatible : Should be "ti,twl6030-usb"
 - interrupts : Two interrupt numbers to the cpu should be specified. First
   interrupt number is the otg interrupt number that raises ID interrupts when
   the controller has to act as host and the second interrupt number is the
   usb interrupt number that raises VBUS interrupts when the controller has to
   act as device
 - usb-supply : phandle to the regulator device tree node. It should be vusb
   if it is twl6030 or ldousb if it is twl6025 subclass.

twl6030-usb {
	compatible = "ti,twl6030-usb";
	interrupts = < 4 10 >;
};

Board specific device node entry
&twl6030-usb {
	usb-supply = <&vusb>;
};

TWL4030 USB PHY AND COMPARATOR
 - compatible : Should be "ti,twl4030-usb"
 - interrupts : The interrupt numbers to the cpu should be specified. First
   interrupt number is the otg interrupt number that raises ID interrupts
   and VBUS interrupts. The second interrupt number is optional.
 - <supply-name>-supply : phandle to the regulator device tree node.
   <supply-name> should be vusb1v5, vusb1v8 and vusb3v1
 - usb_mode : The mode used by the phy to connect to the controller. "1"
   specifies "ULPI" mode and "2" specifies "CEA2011_3PIN" mode.

twl4030-usb {
	compatible = "ti,twl4030-usb";
	interrupts = < 10 4 >;
	usb1v5-supply = <&vusb1v5>;
	usb1v8-supply = <&vusb1v8>;
	usb3v1-supply = <&vusb3v1>;
	usb_mode = <1>;
};
