Samsung High Speed USB OTG controller
-----------------------------

The Samsung HSOTG IP can be found on Samsung SoCs, from S3C6400 onwards.
It gives functionality of OTG-compliant USB 2.0 host and device with
support for USB 2.0 high-speed (480Mbps) and full-speed (12 Mbps)
operation.

Currently only device mode is supported.

Binding details
-----

Required properties:
- compatible: "samsung,s3c6400-hsotg" should be used for all currently
    supported SoC,
- interrupt-parent: phandle for the interrupt controller to which the
    interrupt signal of the HSOTG block is routed,
- interrupts: specifier of interrupt signal of interrupt controller,
    according to bindings of interrupt controller,
- clocks: contains an array of clock specifiers:
    - first entry: OTG clock
- clock-names: contains array of clock names:
    - first entry: must be "otg"
- vusb_d-supply: phandle to voltage regulator of digital section,
- vusb_a-supply: phandle to voltage regulator of analog section.

Example
-----

	hsotg@12480000 {
		compatible = "samsung,s3c6400-hsotg";
		reg = <0x12480000 0x20000>;
		interrupts = <0 71 0>;
		clocks = <&clock 305>;
		clock-names = "otg";
		vusb_d-supply = <&vusb_reg>;
		vusb_a-supply = <&vusbdac_reg>;
	};
