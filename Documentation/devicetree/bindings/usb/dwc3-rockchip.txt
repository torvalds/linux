Rockchip SuperSpeed DWC3 USB SoC controller

Required properties:
- compatible:	should contain "rockchip,dwc3"
- clocks:		A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs for the
				clocks listed in clock-names
- clock-names:	Should contain the following:
  "clk_usb3otg0_ref"	Controller reference clk
  "clk_usb3otg0_suspend"Controller suspend clk, can use 24 MHz or 32 KHz
  "aclk_usb3"		Master/Core clock, have to be >= 62.5 MHz for SS operation


Optional clocks:
  "aclk_usb3otg0"	Aclk for specific usb controller clock.
  "aclk_usb3_rksoc_axi_perf"  USB AXI perf clock.  Not present on all platforms.
  "aclk_usb3_noc"	USB noc clock. Not present on all platforms.
  "aclk_usb3_grf"	USB grf clock.  Not present on all platforms.

Required child node:
A child node must exist to represent the core DWC3 IP block. The name of
the node is not important. The content of the node is defined in dwc3.txt.

Phy documentation is provided in the following places:
