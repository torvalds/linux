DWC3- USB3 CONTROLLER

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be "snps,dwc3"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
 - interrupts: Interrupts used by the dwc3 controller.
 - usb-phy : array of phandle for the PHY device

Optional properties:
 - tx-fifo-resize: determines if the FIFO *has* to be reallocated.

This is usually a subnode to DWC3 glue to which it is connected.

	interrupts = <0 92 4>
	usb-phy = <&usb2_phy>, <&usb3,phy>;
	tx-fifo-resize;
