description: |
  This binding is intended to represent the location of hardware
  configuration data stored in NVMEMs like eeprom, efuses and so on.

  On a significant proportion of boards, the manufacturer has stored
  some data on NVMEM, for the OS to be able to retrieve these
  information and act upon it. Obviously, the OS has to know about
  where to retrieve these data from, and where they are stored on the
  storage device.

    description:
      GPIO to which the write-protect pin of the chip is connected.
      The write-protect GPIO is asserted, when it's driven high
      (logical '1') to block the write operation. It's deasserted,
      when it's driven low (logical '0') to allow writing.

      Alternative to the statically defined nvmem cells, this
      container may reference more advanced (dynamic) layout
      parsers.
