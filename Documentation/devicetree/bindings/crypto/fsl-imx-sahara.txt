Freescale SAHARA Cryptographic Accelerator included in some i.MX chips.
Currently only i.MX27 and i.MX53 are supported.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "fsl,<soc>-sahara"
- reg : Should contain SAHARA registers location and length
- interrupts : Should contain SAHARA interrupt number

Example:

sah@10025000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx27-sahara";
	reg = <	0x10025000 0x800>;
	interrupts = <75>;
};
