  NOTE: the SEC 4 is also known as Freescale's Cryptographic Accelerator
  Accelerator and Assurance Module (CAAM).

  SEC 4 h/w can process requests from 2 types of sources.
  1. DPAA Queue Interface (HW interface between Queue Manager & SEC 4).
  2. Job Rings (HW interface between cores & SEC 4 registers).

  High Speed Data Path Configuration:

  HW interface between QM & SEC 4 and also BM & SEC 4, on DPAA-enabled parts
  such as the P4080.  The number of simultaneous dequeues the QI can make is
  equal to the number of Descriptor Controller (DECO) engines in a particular
  SEC version.  E.g., the SEC 4.0 in the P4080 has 5 DECOs and can thus
  dequeue from 5 subportals simultaneously.

  Job Ring Data Path Configuration:

  Each JR is located on a separate 4k page, they may (or may not) be made visible
  in the memory partition devoted to a particular core.  The P4080 has 4 JRs, so
  up to 4 JRs can be configured; and all 4 JRs process requests in parallel.
