Rockchip Electronics And Security Accelerator

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following:
	- "rockchip,rk3288-crypto": for rk3288
	- "rockchip,px30-crypto": for px30
- reg: Base physical address of the engine and length of memory mapped
       region
- interrupts: Interrupt number
- clocks: Reference to the clocks about crypto
- clock-names: "aclk" used to clock data
	       "hclk" used to clock data
	       "sclk" used to clock crypto accelerator
	       "apb_pclk" used to clock dma
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
	  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the name "crypto-rst".

Examples:

	crypto: cypto-controller@ff8a0000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-crypto";
		reg = <0xff8a0000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 48 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cru ACLK_CRYPTO>, <&cru HCLK_CRYPTO>,
			 <&cru SCLK_CRYPTO>, <&cru ACLK_DMAC1>;
		clock-names = "aclk", "hclk", "sclk", "apb_pclk";
		resets = <&cru SRST_CRYPTO>;
		reset-names = "crypto-rst";
	};
