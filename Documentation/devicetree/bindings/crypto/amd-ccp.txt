- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device
- interrupts: Should contain the CCP interrupt

Example:
	ccp@e0100000 {
		compatible = "amd,ccp-seattle-v1a";
		reg = <0 0xe0100000 0 0x10000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 3 4>;
	};
