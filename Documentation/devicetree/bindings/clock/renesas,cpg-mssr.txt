* Renesas Clock Pulse Generator / Module Standby and Software Reset

On Renesas ARM SoCs (SH/R-Mobile, R-Car, RZ), the CPG (Clock Pulse Generator)
and MSSR (Module Standby and Software Reset) blocks are intimately connected,
and share the same register block.

They provide the following functionalities:
  - The CPG block generates various core clocks,
  - The MSSR block provides two functions:
      1. Module Standby, providing a Clock Domain to control the clock supply
	 to individual SoC devices,
      2. Reset Control, to perform a software reset of individual SoC devices.

Required Properties:
  - compatible: Must be one of:
      - "renesas,r8a7743-cpg-mssr" for the r8a7743 SoC (RZ/G1M)
      - "renesas,r8a7745-cpg-mssr" for the r8a7745 SoC (RZ/G1E)
      - "renesas,r8a7795-cpg-mssr" for the r8a7795 SoC (R-Car H3)
      - "renesas,r8a7796-cpg-mssr" for the r8a7796 SoC (R-Car M3-W)

  - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the CPG/MSSR
    block

  - clocks: References to external parent clocks, one entry for each entry in
    clock-names
  - clock-names: List of external parent clock names. Valid names are:
      - "extal" (r8a7743, r8a7745, r8a7795, r8a7796)
      - "extalr" (r8a7795, r8a7796)
      - "usb_extal" (r8a7743, r8a7745)

  - #clock-cells: Must be 2
      - For CPG core clocks, the two clock specifier cells must be "CPG_CORE"
	and a core clock reference, as defined in
	<dt-bindings/clock/*-cpg-mssr.h>.
      - For module clocks, the two clock specifier cells must be "CPG_MOD" and
	a module number, as defined in the datasheet.

  - #power-domain-cells: Must be 0
      - SoC devices that are part of the CPG/MSSR Clock Domain and can be
	power-managed through Module Standby should refer to the CPG device
	node in their "power-domains" property, as documented by the generic PM
	Domain bindings in
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt.

  - #reset-cells: Must be 1
      - The single reset specifier cell must be the module number, as defined
	in the datasheet.
