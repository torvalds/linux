* Renesas CPG Module Stop (MSTP) Clocks

The CPG can gate SoC device clocks. The gates are organized in groups of up to
32 gates.

This device tree binding describes a single 32 gate clocks group per node.
Clocks are referenced by user nodes by the MSTP node phandle and the clock
index in the group, from 0 to 31.

Required Properties:

  - compatible: Must be one of the following
    - "renesas,r7s72100-mstp-clocks" for R7S72100 (RZ) MSTP gate clocks
    - "renesas,r8a7740-mstp-clocks" for R8A7740 (R-Mobile A1) MSTP gate clocks
    - "renesas,r8a7779-mstp-clocks" for R8A7779 (R-Car H1) MSTP gate clocks
    - "renesas,r8a7790-mstp-clocks" for R8A7790 (R-Car H2) MSTP gate clocks
    - "renesas,r8a7791-mstp-clocks" for R8A7791 (R-Car M2) MSTP gate clocks
    - "renesas,r8a7794-mstp-clocks" for R8A7794 (R-Car E2) MSTP gate clocks
    - "renesas,sh73a0-mstp-clocks" for SH73A0 (SH-MobileAG5) MSTP gate clocks
    - "renesas,cpg-mstp-clock" for generic MSTP gate clocks
  - reg: Base address and length of the I/O mapped registers used by the MSTP
    clocks. The first register is the clock control register and is mandatory.
    The second register is the clock status register and is optional when not
    implemented in hardware.
  - clocks: Reference to the parent clocks, one per output clock. The parents
    must appear in the same order as the output clocks.
  - #clock-cells: Must be 1
  - clock-output-names: The name of the clocks as free-form strings
  - clock-indices: Indices of the gate clocks into the group (0 to 31)

The clocks, clock-output-names and clock-indices properties contain one entry
per gate clock. The MSTP groups are sparsely populated. Unimplemented gate
clocks must not be declared.

		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clock-output-names =
