description: |
  This is a part of device tree bindings for S2M and S5M family of Power
  Management IC (PMIC).

  The S2MPS11/13/15 and S5M8767 provide three(AP/CP/BT) buffered 32.768 kHz
  outputs. The S2MPS14 provides two (AP/BT) buffered 32.768 KHz outputs.

  All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
  dt-bindings/clock/samsung,s2mps11.h header.

  See also Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/samsung,s2mps11.yaml for
  additional information and example.
