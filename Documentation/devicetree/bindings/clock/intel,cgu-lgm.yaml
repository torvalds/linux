description: |
  Lightning Mountain(LGM) SoC's Clock Generation Unit(CGU) driver provides
  all means to access the CGU hardware module in order to generate a series
  of clocks for the whole system and individual peripherals.

  Please refer to include/dt-bindings/clock/intel,lgm-clk.h header file, it
  defines all available clocks as macros. These macros can be used in device
  tree sources.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: intel,cgu-lgm

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  '#clock-cells':
    const: 1

required:
  - compatible
  - reg
  - '#clock-cells'

additionalProperties: false

examples:
  - |
    cgu: clock-controller@e0200000 {
        compatible = "intel,cgu-lgm";
        reg = <0xe0200000 0x33c>;
        #clock-cells = <1>;
    };
