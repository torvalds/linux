* Renesas R-Car Gen2 Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)

The CPG generates core clocks for the R-Car Gen2 SoCs. It includes three PLLs
and several fixed ratio dividers.
The CPG also provides a Clock Domain for SoC devices, in combination with the
CPG Module Stop (MSTP) Clocks.

Required Properties:

  - compatible: Must be one of
    - "renesas,r8a7790-cpg-clocks" for the r8a7790 CPG
    - "renesas,r8a7791-cpg-clocks" for the r8a7791 CPG
    - "renesas,r8a7793-cpg-clocks" for the r8a7793 CPG
    - "renesas,r8a7794-cpg-clocks" for the r8a7794 CPG
    and "renesas,rcar-gen2-cpg-clocks" as a fallback.

  - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the CPG

  - clocks: References to the parent clocks: first to the EXTAL clock, second
    to the USB_EXTAL clock
  - #clock-cells: Must be 1
  - clock-output-names: The names of the clocks. Supported clocks are "main",
    "pll0", "pll1", "pll3", "lb", "qspi", "sdh", "sd0", "sd1", "z", "rcan", and
    "adsp"
  - #power-domain-cells: Must be 0

SoC devices that are part of the CPG/MSTP Clock Domain and can be power-managed
through an MSTP clock should refer to the CPG device node in their
"power-domains" property, as documented by the generic PM domain bindings in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt.


Examples
--------

  - CPG device node:

	cpg_clocks: cpg_clocks@e6150000 {
		compatible = "renesas,r8a7790-cpg-clocks",
			     "renesas,rcar-gen2-cpg-clocks";
		reg = <0 0xe6150000 0 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&extal_clk &usb_extal_clk>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clock-output-names = "main", "pll0, "pll1", "pll3",
				     "lb", "qspi", "sdh", "sd0", "sd1", "z",
				     "rcan", "adsp";
		#power-domain-cells = <0>;
	};


  - CPG/MSTP Clock Domain member device node:

	thermal@e61f0000 {
		compatible = "renesas,thermal-r8a7790", "renesas,rcar-thermal";
		reg = <0 0xe61f0000 0 0x14>, <0 0xe61f0100 0 0x38>;
		interrupts = <0 69 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&mstp5_clks R8A7790_CLK_THERMAL>;
		power-domains = <&cpg_clocks>;
	};
