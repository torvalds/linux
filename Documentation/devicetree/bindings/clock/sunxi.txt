Required properties for all clocks:
- reg : shall be the control register address for the clock.
- clocks : shall be the input parent clock(s) phandle for the clock. For
	multiplexed clocks, the list order must match the hardware
	programming order.
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0 except for
	the following compatibles where it shall be set to 1:
	"allwinner,*-gates-clk", "allwinner,sun4i-pll5-clk",
	"allwinner,sun4i-pll6-clk", "allwinner,sun6i-a31-pll6-clk",
	"allwinner,*-usb-clk", "allwinner,*-mmc-clk",
	"allwinner,*-mmc-config-clk"
- clock-output-names : shall be the corresponding names of the outputs.
	If the clock module only has one output, the name shall be the
	module name.

And "allwinner,*-usb-clk" clocks also require:
- reset-cells : shall be set to 1

The "allwinner,sun4i-a10-ve-clk" clock also requires:
- reset-cells : shall be set to 0

The "allwinner,sun9i-a80-mmc-config-clk" clock also requires:
- #reset-cells : shall be set to 1
- resets : shall be the reset control phandle for the mmc block.

For "allwinner,sun7i-a20-gmac-clk", the parent clocks shall be fixed rate
dummy clocks at 25 MHz and 125 MHz, respectively. See example.

Clock consumers should specify the desired clocks they use with a
"clocks" phandle cell. Consumers that are using a gated clock should
provide an additional ID in their clock property. This ID is the
offset of the bit controlling this particular gate in the register.
For the other clocks with "#clock-cells" = 1, the additional ID shall
refer to the index of the output.

For "allwinner,sun6i-a31-pll6-clk", there are 2 outputs. The first output
is the normal PLL6 output, or "pll6". The second output is rate doubled
PLL6, or "pll6x2".

The "allwinner,*-mmc-clk" clocks have three different outputs: the
main clock, with the ID 0, and the output and sample clocks, with the
IDs 1 and 2, respectively.

The "allwinner,sun9i-a80-mmc-config-clk" clock has one clock/reset output
per mmc controller. The number of outputs is determined by the size of
the address block, which is related to the overall mmc block.
