* Clock bindings for Freescale i.MX6 Quad

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,imx6q-ccm"
- reg: Address and length of the register set
- interrupts: Should contain CCM interrupt
- #clock-cells: Should be <1>

The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
ID in its "clocks" phandle cell.  See include/dt-bindings/clock/imx6qdl-clock.h
for the full list of i.MX6 Quad and DualLite clock IDs.

Examples:

#include <dt-bindings/clock/imx6qdl-clock.h>

clks: ccm@020c4000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-ccm";
	reg = <0x020c4000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <0 87 0x04 0 88 0x04>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
};

uart1: serial@02020000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-uart", "fsl,imx21-uart";
	reg = <0x02020000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <0 26 0x04>;
	clocks = <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_UART_IPG>, <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_UART_SERIAL>;
	clock-names = "ipg", "per";
};
