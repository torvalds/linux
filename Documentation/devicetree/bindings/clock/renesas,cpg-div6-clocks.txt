* Renesas CPG DIV6 Clock

The CPG DIV6 clocks are variable factor clocks provided by the Clock Pulse
Generator (CPG). Their clock input is divided by a configurable factor from 1
to 64.

Required Properties:

  - compatible: Must be one of the following
    - "renesas,r8a73a4-div6-clock" for R8A73A4 (R-Mobile APE6) DIV6 clocks
    - "renesas,r8a7740-div6-clock" for R8A7740 (R-Mobile A1) DIV6 clocks
    - "renesas,r8a7790-div6-clock" for R8A7790 (R-Car H2) DIV6 clocks
    - "renesas,r8a7791-div6-clock" for R8A7791 (R-Car M2-W) DIV6 clocks
    - "renesas,r8a7793-div6-clock" for R8A7793 (R-Car M2-N) DIV6 clocks
    - "renesas,r8a7794-div6-clock" for R8A7794 (R-Car E2) DIV6 clocks
    - "renesas,sh73a0-div6-clock" for SH73A0 (SH-Mobile AG5) DIV6 clocks
    and "renesas,cpg-div6-clock" as a fallback.
  - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the DIV6 clock
  - clocks: Reference to the parent clock(s); either one, four, or eight
    clocks must be specified.  For clocks with multiple parents, invalid
    settings must be specified as "<0>".
  - #clock-cells: Must be 0
  - clock-output-names: The name of the clock as a free-form string
