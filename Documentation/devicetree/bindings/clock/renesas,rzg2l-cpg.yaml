title: Renesas RZ/{G2L,V2L} Clock Pulse Generator / Module Standby Mode

maintainers:
  - Geert Uytterhoeven <geert+renesas@glider.be>

description: |
  On Renesas RZ/{G2L,V2L} SoC, the CPG (Clock Pulse Generator) and Module
  Standby Mode share the same register block.

  They provide the following functionalities:
    - The CPG block generates various core clocks,
    - The Module Standby Mode block provides two functions:
        1. Module Standby, providing a Clock Domain to control the clock supply
           to individual SoC devices,
        2. Reset Control, to perform a software reset of individual SoC devices.

      Clock source to CPG can be either from external clock input (EXCLK) or
      crystal oscillator (XIN/XOUT).

  '#clock-cells':
    description: |
      - For CPG core clocks, the two clock specifier cells must be "CPG_CORE"
        and a core clock reference, as defined in
        <dt-bindings/clock/r9a07g*-cpg.h>
      - For module clocks, the two clock specifier cells must be "CPG_MOD" and
        a module number, as defined in the <dt-bindings/clock/r9a07g0*-cpg.h>.
    const: 2

  '#power-domain-cells':
    description:
      SoC devices that are part of the CPG/Module Standby Mode Clock Domain and
      can be power-managed through Module Standby should refer to the CPG device
      node in their "power-domains" property, as documented by the generic PM
      Domain bindings in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power-domain.yaml.
    const: 0

  '#reset-cells':
    description:
      The single reset specifier cell must be the module number, as defined in
      the <dt-bindings/clock/r9a07g0*-cpg.h>.
