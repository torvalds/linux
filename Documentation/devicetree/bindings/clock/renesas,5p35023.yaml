title: Renesas 5p35023 VersaClock 3 programmable I2C clock generator

maintainers:

description: |
  The 5P35023 is a VersaClock programmable clock generator and
  is designed for low-power, consumer, and high-performance PCI
  express applications. The 5P35023 device is a three PLL
  architecture design, and each PLL is individually programmable
  and allowing for up to 6 unique frequency outputs.

  An internal OTP memory allows the user to store the configuration
  in the device. After power up, the user can change the device register
  settings through the I2C interface when I2C mode is selected.

  The driver can read a full register map from the DT, and will use that
  register map to initialize the attached part (via I2C) when the system
  boots. Any configuration not supported by the common clock framework
  must be done via the full register map, including optimized settings.
