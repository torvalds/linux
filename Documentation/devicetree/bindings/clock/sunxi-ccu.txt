Allwinner Clock Control Unit Binding
------------------------------------

Required properties :
- compatible: must contain one of the following compatible:
		- "allwinner,sun8i-h3-ccu"

- reg: Must contain the registers base address and length
- clocks: phandle to the oscillators feeding the CCU. Two are needed:
  - "hosc": the high frequency oscillator (usually at 24MHz)
  - "losc": the low frequency oscillator (usually at 32kHz)
- clock-names: Must contain the clock names described just above
- #clock-cells : must contain 1
- #reset-cells : must contain 1

Example:
ccu: clock@01c20000 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-h3-ccu";
	reg = <0x01c20000 0x400>;
	clocks = <&osc24M>, <&osc32k>;
	clock-names = "hosc", "losc";
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	#reset-cells = <1>;
};
