* Samsung Exynos7 Clock Controller

Exynos7 clock controller has various blocks which are instantiated
independently from the device-tree. These clock controllers
generate and supply clocks to various hardware blocks within
the SoC.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use
this identifier to specify the clock which they consume. All
available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
dt-bindings/clock/exynos7-clk.h header and can be used in
device tree sources.

External clocks:

There are several clocks that are generated outside the SoC. It
is expected that they are defined using standard clock bindings
with following clock-output-names:

 - "fin_pll" - PLL input clock from XXTI

Required Properties for Clock Controller:

 - compatible: clock controllers will use one of the following
	compatible strings to indicate the clock controller
	functionality.

	- "samsung,exynos7-clock-topc"
	- "samsung,exynos7-clock-top0"
	- "samsung,exynos7-clock-top1"
	- "samsung,exynos7-clock-ccore"
	- "samsung,exynos7-clock-peric0"
	- "samsung,exynos7-clock-peric1"
	- "samsung,exynos7-clock-peris"
	- "samsung,exynos7-clock-fsys0"
	- "samsung,exynos7-clock-fsys1"

 - reg: physical base address of the controller and the length of
	memory mapped region.

 - #clock-cells: should be 1.

 - clocks: list of clock identifiers which are fed as the input to
	the given clock controller. Please refer the next section to
	find the input clocks for a given controller.

- clock-names: list of names of clocks which are fed as the input
	to the given clock controller.
