description: |
  NXP LS1028A has a clock domain PXLCLK0 used for the Display output
  interface in the display core, as implemented in TSMC CLN28HPM PLL.
  which generate and offers pixel clocks to Display.

  fsl,vco-hz:
    description: Optional for VCO frequency of the PLL in Hertz. The VCO frequency
      of this PLL cannot be changed during runtime only at startup. Therefore,
      the output frequencies are very limited and might not even closely match
      the requested frequency. To work around this restriction the user may specify
      its own desired VCO frequency for the PLL.
