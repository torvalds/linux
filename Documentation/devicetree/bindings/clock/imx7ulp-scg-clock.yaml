title: Clock bindings for Freescale i.MX7ULP System Clock Generation (SCG) modules

description: |
  i.MX7ULP Clock functions are under joint control of the System
  Clock Generation (SCG) modules, Peripheral Clock Control (PCC)
  modules, and Core Mode Controller (CMC)1 blocks

  The clocking scheme provides clear separation between M4 domain
  and A7 domain. Except for a few clock sources shared between two
  domains, such as the System Oscillator clock, the Slow IRC (SIRC),
  and and the Fast IRC clock (FIRCLK), clock sources and clock
  management are separated and contained within each domain.

  M4 clock management consists of SCG0, PCC0, PCC1, and CMC0 modules.
  A7 clock management consists of SCG1, PCC2, PCC3, and CMC1 modules.

  Note: this binding doc is only for A7 clock domain.

  The System Clock Generation (SCG) is responsible for clock generation
  and distribution across this device. Functions performed by the SCG
  include: clock reference selection, generation of clock used to derive
  processor, system, peripheral bus and external memory interface clocks,
  source selection for peripheral clocks and control of power saving
  clock gating mode.

  The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
  ID in its "clocks" phandle cell.
  See include/dt-bindings/clock/imx7ulp-clock.h for the full list of
  i.MX7ULP clock IDs of each module.
