title: Apple SoCs' NCO block

description: |
  The NCO (Numerically Controlled Oscillator) block found on Apple SoCs
  such as the t8103 (M1) is a programmable clock generator performing
  fractional division of a high frequency input clock.

  It carries a number of independent channels and is typically used for
  generation of audio bitclocks.
