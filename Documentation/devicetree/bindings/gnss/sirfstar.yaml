title: SiRFstar GNSS Receiver Device Tree Bindings

description:
  The SiRFstar GNSS receivers have incarnated over the years in different
  chips, starting from the SiRFstarIII which was a chip that was introduced in
  2004 and used in a lot of dedicated GPS devices. In 2009 SiRF was acquired
  by CSR (Cambridge Silicon Radio) and in 2012 the CSR GPS business was
  acquired by Samsung, while some products remained with CSR. In 2014 CSR
  was acquired by Qualcomm who still sell some of the SiRF products.

  SiRF chips can be used over UART, I2C or SPI buses.
