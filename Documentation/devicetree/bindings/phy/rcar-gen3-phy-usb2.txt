* Renesas R-Car generation 3 USB 2.0 PHY

This file provides information on what the device node for the R-Car generation
3, RZ/G1C and RZ/G2 USB 2.0 PHY contain.

Required properties:
- compatible: "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a77470" if the device is a part of an R8A77470
	      SoC.
	      "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a774a1" if the device is a part of an R8A774A1
	      SoC.
	      "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a774c0" if the device is a part of an R8A774C0
	      SoC.
	      "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a7795" if the device is a part of an R8A7795
	      SoC.
	      "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a7796" if the device is a part of an R8A7796
	      SoC.
	      "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a77965" if the device is a part of an
	      R8A77965 SoC.
	      "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a77990" if the device is a part of an
	      R8A77990 SoC.
	      "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a77995" if the device is a part of an
	      R8A77995 SoC.
	      "renesas,rcar-gen3-usb2-phy" for a generic R-Car Gen3 or RZ/G2
	      compatible device.

	      When compatible with the generic version, nodes must list the
	      SoC-specific version corresponding to the platform first
	      followed by the generic version.

- reg: offset and length of the partial USB 2.0 Host register block.
- clocks: clock phandle and specifier pair(s).
- #phy-cells: see phy-bindings.txt in the same directory, must be <1> (and
	      using <0> is deprecated).

The phandle's argument in the PHY specifier is the INT_STATUS bit of controller:
- 1 = USBH_INTA (OHCI)
- 2 = USBH_INTB (EHCI)
- 3 = UCOM_INT (OTG and BC)

Optional properties:
To use a USB channel where USB 2.0 Host and HSUSB (USB 2.0 Peripheral) are
combined, the device tree node should set interrupt properties to use the
channel as USB OTG:
- interrupts: interrupt specifier for the PHY.
- vbus-supply: Phandle to a regulator that provides power to the VBUS. This
	       regulator will be managed during the PHY power on/off sequence.
- renesas,no-otg-pins: boolean, specify when a board does not provide proper
		       otg pins.

Example (R-Car H3):

	usb-phy@ee080200 {
		compatible = "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a7795", "renesas,rcar-gen3-usb2-phy";
		reg = <0 0xee080200 0 0x700>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 108 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 703>;
	};

	usb-phy@ee0a0200 {
		compatible = "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a7795", "renesas,rcar-gen3-usb2-phy";
		reg = <0 0xee0a0200 0 0x700>;
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD 702>;
	};
