* Renesas R-Car generation 3 USB 2.0 PHY

This file provides information on what the device node for the R-Car generation
3 USB 2.0 PHY contains.

Required properties:
- compatible: "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a7795" if the device is a part of an R8A7795
	      SoC.
- reg: offset and length of the partial USB 2.0 Host register block.
- clocks: clock phandle and specifier pair(s).
- #phy-cells: see phy-bindings.txt in the same directory, must be <0>.

Optional properties:
To use a USB channel where USB 2.0 Host and HSUSB (USB 2.0 Peripheral) are
combined, the device tree node should set interrupt properties to use the
channel as USB OTG:
- interrupts: interrupt specifier for the PHY.

Example (R-Car H3):

	usb-phy@ee080200 {
		compatible = "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a7795";
		reg = <0 0xee080200 0 0x700>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 108 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&mstp7_clks R8A7795_CLK_EHCI0>;
	};

	usb-phy@ee0a0200 {
		compatible = "renesas,usb2-phy-r8a7795";
		reg = <0 0xee0a0200 0 0x700>;
		clocks = <&mstp7_clks R8A7795_CLK_EHCI0>;
	};
