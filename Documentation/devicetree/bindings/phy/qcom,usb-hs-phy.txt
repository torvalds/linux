Qualcomm's USB HS PHY

PROPERTIES

- compatible:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <string>
    Definition: Should contain "qcom,usb-hs-phy" and more specifically one of the
                following:

                        "qcom,usb-hs-phy-apq8064"
                        "qcom,usb-hs-phy-msm8226"
                        "qcom,usb-hs-phy-msm8916"
                        "qcom,usb-hs-phy-msm8974"

- #phy-cells:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <u32>
    Definition: Should contain 0

- clocks:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
    Definition: Should contain clock specifier for the reference and sleep
                clocks

- clock-names:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <stringlist>
    Definition: Should contain "ref" and "sleep" for the reference and sleep
                clocks respectively

- resets:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
    Definition: Should contain the phy and POR resets

- reset-names:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <stringlist>
    Definition: Should contain "phy" and "por" for the phy and POR resets
                respectively

- v3p3-supply:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <phandle>
    Definition: Should contain a reference to the 3.3V supply

- v1p8-supply:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <phandle>
    Definition: Should contain a reference to the 1.8V supply

- extcon:
    Usage: optional
    Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
    Definition: Should contain the vbus extcon

- qcom,init-seq:
    Usage: optional
    Value type: <u8 array>
    Definition: Should contain a sequence of ULPI address and value pairs to
                program into the ULPI_EXT_VENDOR_SPECIFIC area. This is related
                to Device Mode Eye Diagram test. The addresses are offsets
                from the ULPI_EXT_VENDOR_SPECIFIC address, for example,
                <0x1 0x53> would mean "write the value 0x53 to address 0x81".
