* Broadcom SATA3 PHY

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one or more of
     "brcm,bcm7425-sata-phy"
     "brcm,bcm7445-sata-phy"
     "brcm,iproc-ns2-sata-phy"
     "brcm,iproc-nsp-sata-phy"
     "brcm,phy-sata3"
     "brcm,iproc-sr-sata-phy"
- address-cells: should be 1
- size-cells: should be 0
- reg: register ranges for the PHY PCB interface
- reg-names: should be "phy" and "phy-ctrl"
     The "phy-ctrl" registers are only required for
     "brcm,iproc-ns2-sata-phy" and "brcm,iproc-sr-sata-phy".

Sub-nodes:
  Each port's PHY should be represented as a sub-node.

Sub-nodes required properties:
- reg: the PHY number
- phy-cells: generic PHY binding; must be 0

Sub-nodes optional properties:
- brcm,enable-ssc: use spread spectrum clocking (SSC) on this port
     This property is not applicable for "brcm,iproc-ns2-sata-phy",
     "brcm,iproc-nsp-sata-phy" and "brcm,iproc-sr-sata-phy".

- brcm,rxaeq-mode: string that indicates the desired RX equalizer
  mode, possible values are:
	"off" (equivalent to not specifying the property)
	"auto"
	"manual" (brcm,rxaeq-value is used in that case)

- brcm,rxaeq-value: when 'rxaeq-mode' is set to "manual", provides the RX
  equalizer value that should be used. Allowed range is 0..63.

Example
	sata-phy@f0458100 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm7445-sata-phy", "brcm,phy-sata3";
		reg = <0xf0458100 0x1e00>, <0xf045804c 0x10>;
		reg-names = "phy";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		sata-phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
		};

		sata-phy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
		};
	};
