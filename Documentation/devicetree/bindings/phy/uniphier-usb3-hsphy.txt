Socionext UniPhier USB3 High-Speed (HS) PHY

This describes the devicetree bindings for PHY interfaces built into
USB3 controller implemented on Socionext UniPhier SoCs.
Although the controller includes High-Speed PHY and Super-Speed PHY,
this describes about High-Speed PHY.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain one of the following:
    "socionext,uniphier-pro5-usb3-hsphy" - for Pro5 SoC
    "socionext,uniphier-pxs2-usb3-hsphy" - for PXs2 SoC
    "socionext,uniphier-ld20-usb3-hsphy" - for LD20 SoC
    "socionext,uniphier-pxs3-usb3-hsphy" - for PXs3 SoC
- reg: Specifies offset and length of the register set for the device.
- #phy-cells: Should be 0.
- clocks: A list of phandles to the clock gate for USB3 glue layer.
	According to the clock-names, appropriate clocks are required.
- clock-names: Should contain the following:
    "gio", "link" - for Pro5 SoC
    "phy", "phy-ext", "link" - for PXs3 SoC, "phy-ext" is optional.
    "phy", "link" - for others
- resets: A list of phandles to the reset control for USB3 glue layer.
	According to the reset-names, appropriate resets are required.
- reset-names: Should contain the following:
    "gio", "link" - for Pro5 SoC
    "phy", "link" - for others

Optional properties:
- vbus-supply: A phandle to the regulator for USB VBUS.
- nvmem-cells: Phandles to nvmem cell that contains the trimming data.
	Available only for HS-PHY implemented on LD20 and PXs3, and
	if unspecified, default value is used.
- nvmem-cell-names: Should be the following names, which correspond to
	each nvmem-cells.
	All of the 3 parameters associated with the following names are
	required for each port, if any one is omitted, the trimming data
	of the port will not be set at all.
    "rterm", "sel_t", "hs_i" - Each cell name for phy parameters

Refer to phy/phy-bindings.txt for the generic PHY binding properties.

Example:

	usb-glue@65b00000 {
		compatible = "socionext,uniphier-ld20-dwc3-glue",
			     "simple-mfd";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges = <0 0x65b00000 0x400>;

		usb_vbus0: regulator {
			...
		};

		usb_hsphy0: hs-phy@200 {
			compatible = "socionext,uniphier-ld20-usb3-hsphy";
			reg = <0x200 0x10>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
			clock-names = "link", "phy";
			clocks = <&sys_clk 14>, <&sys_clk 16>;
			reset-names = "link", "phy";
			resets = <&sys_rst 14>, <&sys_rst 16>;
			vbus-supply = <&usb_vbus0>;
			nvmem-cell-names = "rterm", "sel_t", "hs_i";
			nvmem-cells = <&usb_rterm0>, <&usb_sel_t0>,
				      <&usb_hs_i0>;
		};
		...
	};
