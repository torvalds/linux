 - vdda-phy-supply: Phandle to a regulator supply to PHY core block.
 - vdda-pll-supply: Phandle to 1.8V regulator supply to PHY refclk pll block.

Optional properties:
 - vddp-ref-clk-supply: Phandle to a regulator supply to any specific refclk
			pll block.

Required nodes:
 - Each device node of QMP phy is required to have as many child nodes as
   the number of lanes the PHY has.

Required properties for child nodes of PCIe PHYs (one child per lane):
 - reg: list of offset and length pairs of register sets for PHY blocks -
	tx, rx, pcs, and pcs_misc (optional).
 - #phy-cells: must be 0

Required properties for a single "lanes" child node of non-PCIe PHYs:
 - reg: list of offset and length pairs of register sets for PHY blocks
	For 1-lane devices:
		tx, rx, pcs, and (optionally) pcs_misc
	For 2-lane devices:
		tx0, rx0, pcs, tx1, rx1, and (optionally) pcs_misc
 - #phy-cells: must be 0

Required properties for child node of PCIe and USB3 qmp phys:
 - clocks: a list of phandles and clock-specifier pairs,
	   one for each entry in clock-names.
 - clock-names: Must contain following:
		 "pipe<lane-number>" for pipe clock specific to each lane.
 - clock-output-names: Name of the PHY clock that will be the parent for
		       the above pipe clock.
	For "qcom,ipq8074-qmp-pcie-phy":
		- "pcie20_phy0_pipe_clk"	Pipe Clock parent
			(or)
		  "pcie20_phy1_pipe_clk"
 - #clock-cells: must be 0
    - Phy pll outputs pipe clocks for pipe based PHYs. These clocks are then
      gate-controlled by the gcc.

Required properties for child node of PHYs with lane reset, AKA:
	"qcom,msm8996-qmp-pcie-phy"
 - resets: a list of phandles and reset controller specifier pairs,
	   one for each entry in reset-names.
 - reset-names: Must contain following:
		 "lane<lane-number>" for reset specific to each lane.
