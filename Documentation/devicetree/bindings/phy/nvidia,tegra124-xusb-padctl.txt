Device tree binding for NVIDIA Tegra XUSB pad controller
========================================================

The Tegra XUSB pad controller manages a set of I/O lanes (with differential
signals) which connect directly to pins/pads on the SoC package. Each lane
is controlled by a HW block referred to as a "pad" in the Tegra hardware
documentation. Each such "pad" may control either one or multiple lanes,
and thus contains any logic common to all its lanes. Each lane can be
separately configured and powered up.

Some of the lanes are high-speed lanes, which can be used for PCIe, SATA or
super-speed USB. Other lanes are for various types of low-speed, full-speed
or high-speed USB (such as UTMI, ULPI and HSIC). The XUSB pad controller
contains a software-configurable mux that sits between the I/O controller
ports (e.g. PCIe) and the lanes.

In addition to per-lane configuration, USB 3.0 ports may require additional
settings on a per-board basis.

Pads will be represented as children of the top-level XUSB pad controller
device tree node. Each lane exposed by the pad will be represented by its
own subnode and can be referenced by users of the lane using the standard
PHY bindings, as described by the phy-bindings.txt file in this directory.

The Tegra hardware documentation refers to the connection between the XUSB
pad controller and the XUSB controller as "ports". This is confusing since
"port" is typically used to denote the physical USB receptacle. The device
tree binding in this document uses the term "port" to refer to the logical
abstraction of the signals that are routed to a USB receptacle (i.e. a PHY
for the USB signal, the VBUS power supply, the USB 2.0 companion port for
USB 3.0 receptacles, ...).

Pad nodes:
==========

A required child node named "pads" contains a list of subnodes, one for each
of the pads exposed by the XUSB pad controller. Each pad may need additional
resources that can be referenced in its pad node.

The "status" property is used to enable or disable the use of a pad. If set
to "disabled", the pad will not be used on the given board. In order to use
the pad and any of its lanes, this property must be set to "okay".

For Tegra124 and Tegra132, the following pads exist: usb2, ulpi, hsic, pcie
and sata. No extra resources are required for operation of these pads.

For Tegra210, the following pads exist: usb2, hsic, pcie and sata. Below is
a description of the properties of each pad.

UTMI pad:

PHY nodes:
==========

Each pad node has a child named "lanes" that contains one or more children of
its own, each representing one of the lanes controlled by the pad.

  valid functions per SoC generation.

For Tegra124 and Tegra132, the list of valid PHY nodes is given below:

A required child node named "ports" contains a list of all the ports exposed
by the XUSB pad controller. Per-port configuration is only required for USB.

USB2 ports:
-----------

Required properties:
- status: Defines the operation status of the port. Valid values are:
  - "disabled": the port is disabled

  peripheral mode. If present, the port supports switching between USB host
  and peripheral roles. Connector should be added as subnode.
  See usb/usb-conn-gpio.txt.

Optional properties:

  is internal. In the absence of this property the port is considered to be
  external.

Optional properties:
- status: Defines the operation status of the port. Valid values are:
  - "disabled": the port is disabled
