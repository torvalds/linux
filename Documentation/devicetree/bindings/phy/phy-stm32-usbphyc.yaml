title: STMicroelectronics STM32 USB HS PHY controller binding

description:

  The STM32 USBPHYC block contains a dual port High Speed UTMI+ PHY and a UTMI
  switch. It controls PHY configuration and status, and the UTMI+ switch that
  selects either OTG or HOST controller for the second PHY port. It also sets
  PLL configuration.
