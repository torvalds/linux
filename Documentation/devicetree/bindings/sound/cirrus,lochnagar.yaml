description: |
  Lochnagar is an evaluation and development board for Cirrus Logic
  Smart CODEC and Amp devices. It allows the connection of most Cirrus
  Logic devices on mini-cards, as well as allowing connection of various
  application processor systems to provide a full evaluation platform.
  Audio system topology, clocking and power can all be controlled through
  the Lochnagar, allowing the device under test to be used in a variety of
  possible use cases.

  This binding document describes the binding for the audio portion of the
  driver.
