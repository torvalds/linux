Q6ASM is one of the APR audio service on Q6DSP.
Please refer to qcom,apr.txt for details of the common apr service bindings
used by the apr service device.

- but must contain the following property:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,q6asm-v<MAJOR-NUMBER>.<MINOR-NUMBER>".
		    Or "qcom,q6asm" where the version number can be queried
		    from DSP.
		    example "qcom,q6asm-v2.0"

= ASM DAIs (Digial Audio Interface)
"dais" subnode of the ASM node represents dai specific configuration

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,q6asm-dais".

- #sound-dai-cells
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Must be 1

== ASM DAI is subnode of "dais" and represent a dai, it includes board specific
configuration of each dai. Must contain the following properties.

- reg
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Must be dai id

- direction:
	Usage: Required for Compress offload dais
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Specifies the direction of the dai stream
			0 for both tx and rx
			1 for only tx (Capture/Encode)
			2 for only rx (Playback/Decode)

- is-compress-dai:
	Usage: Required for Compress offload dais
	Value type: <boolean>
	Definition: present for Compress offload dais
