BROADCOM Cygnus Audio I2S/TDM/SPDIF controller

Required properties:
	- compatible : "brcm,cygnus-audio"
	- #address-cells: 32bit valued, 1 cell.
	- #size-cells:  32bit valued, 0 cell.
	- reg : Should contain audio registers location and length
	- reg-names: names of the registers listed in "reg" property
		Valid names are "aud" and "i2s_in". "aud" contains a
		set of DMA, I2S_OUT and SPDIF registers. "i2s_in" contains
		a set of I2S_IN registers.
	- clocks: PLL and leaf clocks used by audio ports
	- assigned-clocks: PLL and leaf clocks
	- assigned-clock-parents: parent clocks of the assigned clocks
		(usually the PLL)
	- assigned-clock-rates: List of clock frequencies of the
		assigned clocks
	- clock-names: names of 3 leaf clocks used by audio ports
		Valid names are "ch0_audio", "ch1_audio", "ch2_audio"
	- interrupts: audio DMA interrupt number

SSP Subnode properties:
- reg: The index of ssp port interface to use
	Valid value are 0, 1, 2, or 3 (for spdif)
