* Qualcomm Technologies LPASS CPU DAI

This node models the Qualcomm Technologies Low-Power Audio SubSystem (LPASS).

Required properties:

- compatible		: "qcom,lpass-cpu" or "qcom,apq8016-lpass-cpu"
- clocks		: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names		: A list which must include the following entries:
				* "ahbix-clk"
				* "mi2s-osr-clk"
				* "mi2s-bit-clk"
			: required clocks for "qcom,lpass-cpu-apq8016"
				* "ahbix-clk"
				* "mi2s-bit-clk0"
				* "mi2s-bit-clk1"
				* "mi2s-bit-clk2"
				* "mi2s-bit-clk3"
				* "pcnoc-mport-clk"
				* "pcnoc-sway-clk"

- interrupts		: Must contain an entry for each entry in
			  interrupt-names.
- interrupt-names	: A list which must include the following entries:
				* "lpass-irq-lpaif"
- pinctrl-N		: One property must exist for each entry in
			  pinctrl-names.  See ../pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
			  for details of the property values.
- pinctrl-names		: Must contain a "default" entry.
- reg			: Must contain an address for each entry in reg-names.
- reg-names		: A list which must include the following entries:
				* "lpass-lpaif"



Optional properties:

- qcom,adsp		: Phandle for the audio DSP node

Example:

lpass@28100000 {
	compatible = "qcom,lpass-cpu";
	clocks = <&lcc AHBIX_CLK>, <&lcc MI2S_OSR_CLK>, <&lcc MI2S_BIT_CLK>;
	clock-names = "ahbix-clk", "mi2s-osr-clk", "mi2s-bit-clk";
	interrupts = <0 85 1>;
	interrupt-names = "lpass-irq-lpaif";
	pinctrl-names = "default", "idle";
	pinctrl-0 = <&mi2s_default>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&mi2s_idle>;
	reg = <0x28100000 0x10000>;
	reg-names = "lpass-lpaif";
	qcom,adsp = <&adsp>;
};
