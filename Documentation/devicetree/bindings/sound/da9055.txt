* Dialog DA9055 Audio CODEC

DA9055 provides Audio CODEC support (I2C only).

The Audio CODEC device in DA9055 has its own I2C address which is configurable,
so the device is instantiated separately from the PMIC (MFD) device.

For details on accompanying PMIC I2C device, see the following:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/da9055.txt

Required properties:

  - compatible: "dlg,da9055-codec"
  - reg: Specifies the I2C slave address


Example:

	codec: da9055-codec@1a {
		compatible = "dlg,da9055-codec";
		reg = <0x1a>;
	};
