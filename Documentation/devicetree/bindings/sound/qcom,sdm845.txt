* Qualcomm Technologies Inc. SDM845 ASoC sound card driver

This binding describes the SDM845 sound card, which uses qdsp for audio.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,sdm845-sndcard"

- audio-routing:
	Usage: Optional
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition:  A list of the connections between audio components.
		  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
		  connection's sink, the second being the connection's
		  source. Valid names could be power supplies, MicBias
		  of codec and the jacks on the board.

- model:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: The user-visible name of this sound card.

= dailinks
Each subnode of sndcard represents either a dailink, and subnodes of each
dailinks would be cpu/codec/platform dais.

- link-name:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: User friendly name for dai link

= CPU, PLATFORM, CODEC dais subnodes
- cpu:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <subnode>
	Definition: cpu dai sub-node

- codec:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <subnode>
	Definition: codec dai sub-node

- platform:
	Usage: Optional
	Value type: <subnode>
	Definition: platform dai sub-node

- sound-dai:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: dai phandle/s and port of CPU/CODEC/PLATFORM node.

Example:

audio {
	compatible = "qcom,sdm845-sndcard";
	model = "sdm845-snd-card";
	pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pri_mi2s_active &pri_mi2s_ws_active>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&pri_mi2s_sleep &pri_mi2s_ws_sleep>;

	mm1-dai-link {
		link-name = "MultiMedia1";
		cpu {
			sound-dai = <&q6asmdai MSM_FRONTEND_DAI_MULTIMEDIA1>;
		};
	};

	pri-mi2s-dai-link {
		link-name = "PRI MI2S Playback";
		cpu {
			sound-dai = <&q6afedai PRIMARY_MI2S_RX>;
		};

		platform {
			sound-dai = <&q6routing>;
		};
	};
};
