Texas Instruments pcm3168a DT bindings

This driver supports both SPI and I2C bus access for this codec

Required properties:

  - compatible: "ti,pcm3168a"

  - clocks : Contains an entry for each entry in clock-names

  - clock-names : Includes the following entries:
	"scki"	The system clock

  - VDD1-supply : Digital power supply regulator 1 (+3.3V)

  - VDD2-supply : Digital power supply regulator 2 (+3.3V)

  - VCCAD1-supply : ADC power supply regulator 1 (+5V)

  - VCCAD2-supply : ADC power supply regulator 2 (+5V)

  - VCCDA1-supply : DAC power supply regulator 1 (+5V)

  - VCCDA2-supply : DAC power supply regulator 2 (+5V)

For required properties on SPI/I2C, consult SPI/I2C device tree documentation

Optional properties:

  - rst-gpios : Optional RST gpio line for the codec
		RST = low: device power-down
		RST = high: device is enabled

Examples:

i2c0: i2c0@0 {

	...
