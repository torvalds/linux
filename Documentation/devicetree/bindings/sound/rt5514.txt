RT5514 audio CODEC

This device supports both I2C and SPI.

Required properties:

- compatible : "realtek,rt5514".

- reg : the I2C address of the device for I2C, the chip select
        number for SPI.

Optional properties:

- clocks: The phandle of the master clock to the CODEC
- clock-names: Should be "mclk"

- interrupt-parent: The phandle for the interrupt controller.
- interrupts: The interrupt number to the cpu. The interrupt specifier format
	      depends on the interrupt controller.

- realtek,dmic-init-delay-ms
  Set the DMIC initial delay (ms) to wait it ready for I2C.

Pins on the device (for linking into audio routes) for I2C:

  * DMIC1L
  * DMIC1R
  * DMIC2L
  * DMIC2R
  * AMICL
  * AMICR

Example:

codec: rt5514@57 {
	compatible = "realtek,rt5514";
	reg = <0x57>;
};
