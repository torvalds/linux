Example for rk3308 VAD controller:

vad: vad@ff3c0000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,rk3308-vad";
	reg = <0x0 0xff3c0000 0x0 0x10000>;
	reg-names = "vad";
	clocks = <&cru HCLK_VAD>;
	clock-names = "hclk";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 57 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	rockchip,audio-sram = <&vad_sram>;
	rockchip,audio-src = <&i2s_8ch_0>;
	rockchip,det-channel = <0>;
