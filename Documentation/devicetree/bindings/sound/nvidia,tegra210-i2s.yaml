title: Tegra210 I2S Controller Device Tree Bindings

description: |
  The Inter-IC Sound (I2S) controller implements full-duplex,
  bi-directional and single direction point-to-point serial
  interfaces. It can interface with I2S compatible devices.
  I2S controller can operate both in master and slave mode.

          Sync input clock, which can act as clock source to other I/O
          modules in AHUB. The Tegra I2S driver sets this clock rate as
          per bit clock rate. I/O module which wants to use this clock
          as source, can mention this clock as parent in the DT bindings.
          This is an optional clock entry, since it is only required when
          some other I/O wants to reference from a particular I2Sx
          instance.
