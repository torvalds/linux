QCOM WCD9335 Codec

Qualcomm WCD9335 Codec is a standalone Hi-Fi audio codec IC, supports
Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI) multimedia solutions, including
the MSM8996, MSM8976, and MSM8956 chipsets. It has in-built
Soundwire controller, interrupt mux. It supports both I2S/I2C and
SLIMbus audio interfaces.

	Definition: For SLIMbus interface it should be "slimMID,PID",
		    textual representation of Manufacturer ID, Product Code,
		    shall be in lower case hexadecimal with leading zeroes
		    suppressed.  Refer to slimbus/bus.txt for details.
		    Should be:
		    "slim217,1a0" for MSM8996 and APQ8096 SoCs with SLIMbus.
