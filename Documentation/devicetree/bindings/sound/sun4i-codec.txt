* Allwinner A10 Codec

Required properties:
- compatible: must be one of the following compatibles:
		- "allwinner,sun4i-a10-codec"
		- "allwinner,sun6i-a31-codec"
		- "allwinner,sun7i-a20-codec"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-a23-codec"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-h3-codec"
- reg: must contain the registers location and length
- interrupts: must contain the codec interrupt
- dmas: DMA channels for tx and rx dma. See the DMA client binding,
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
- dma-names: should include "tx" and "rx".
- clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifer pairs, one for each entry
  in clock-names.
- clock-names: should contain followings:
   - "apb": the parent APB clock for this controller
   - "codec": the parent module clock

Optional properties:
- allwinner,pa-gpios: gpio to enable external amplifier

Required properties for the following compatibles:
		- "allwinner,sun6i-a31-codec"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-a23-codec"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-h3-codec"
- resets: phandle to the reset control for this device
- allwinner,audio-routing: A list of the connections between audio components.
			   Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
			   connection's sink, the second being the connection's
			   source. Valid names include:

			   Audio pins on the SoC:
			   "HP"
			   "HPCOM"
			   "LINEIN"
			   "LINEOUT"	(not on sun8i-a23)
			   "MIC1"
			   "MIC2"
			   "MIC3"	(sun6i-a31 only)

			   Microphone biases from the SoC:
			   "HBIAS"
			   "MBIAS"

			   Board connectors:
			   "Headphone"
			   "Headset Mic"
			   "Line In"
			   "Line Out"
			   "Mic"
			   "Speaker"

Required properties for the following compatibles:
		- "allwinner,sun8i-a23-codec"
		- "allwinner,sun8i-h3-codec"
- allwinner,codec-analog-controls: A phandle to the codec analog controls
				   block in the PRCM.
