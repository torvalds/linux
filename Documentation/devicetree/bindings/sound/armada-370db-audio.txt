Device Tree bindings for the Armada 370 DB audio
================================================

These Device Tree bindings are used to describe the audio complex
found on the Armada 370 DB platform.

Mandatory properties:

 * compatible: must be "marvell,a370db-audio"

 * marvell,audio-controller: a phandle that points to the audio
   controller of the Armada 370 SoC.

 * marvell,audio-codec: a set of three phandles that points to:

    1/ the analog audio codec connected to the Armada 370 SoC
    2/ the S/PDIF transceiver
    3/ the S/PDIF receiver

Example:

	sound {
	      compatible = "marvell,a370db-audio";
	      marvell,audio-controller = <&audio_controller>;
	      marvell,audio-codec = <&audio_codec &spdif_out &spdif_in>;
	      status = "okay";
	};
