* Ingenic JZ4780 I2C Bus controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following:
  - "ingenic,jz4780-i2c" for the JZ4780
  - "ingenic,x1000-i2c" for the X1000
- reg: Should contain the address & size of the I2C controller registers.
- interrupts: Should specify the interrupt provided by parent.
- clocks: Should contain a single clock specifier for the JZ4780 I2C clock.
- clock-frequency: desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.

Recommended properties:
- pinctrl-names: should be "default";
- pinctrl-0: phandle to pinctrl function

Example

/ {
	i2c4: i2c4@10054000 {
		compatible = "ingenic,jz4780-i2c";
		reg = <0x10054000 0x1000>;

		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <56>;

		clocks = <&cgu JZ4780_CLK_SMB4>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&pins_i2c4_data>;

	};
};
