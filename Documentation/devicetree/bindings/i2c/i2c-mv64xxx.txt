* Marvell MV64XXX I2C controller

Required properties :

 - reg             : Offset and length of the register set for the device
 - compatible      : Should be "marvell,mv64xxx-i2c" or "allwinner,sun4i-i2c"
                     or "marvell,mv78230-i2c" or "marvell,mv78230-a0-i2c"
                     Note: Only use "marvell,mv78230-a0-i2c" for a very rare,
                     initial version of the SoC which had broken offload
                     support.  Linux auto-detects this and sets it
                     appropriately.
 - interrupts      : The interrupt number

Optional properties :

 - clock-frequency : Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz. If not set the
default frequency is 100kHz

Examples:

	i2c@11000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mv64xxx-i2c";
		reg = <0x11000 0x20>;
		interrupts = <29>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
	};

For the Armada XP:

	i2c@11000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mv78230-i2c", "marvell,mv64xxx-i2c";
		reg = <0x11000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <29>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
	};
