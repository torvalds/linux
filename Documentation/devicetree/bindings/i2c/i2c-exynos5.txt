* Samsung's High Speed I2C controller

The Samsung's High Speed I2C controller is used to interface with I2C devices
at various speeds ranging from 100khz to 3.4Mhz.

Required properties:
  - compatible: value should be.
	-> "samsung,exynos5-hsi2c", (DEPRECATED)
				for i2c compatible with HSI2C available
				on Exynos5250 and Exynos5420 SoCs.
	-> "samsung,exynos5250-hsi2c", for i2c compatible with HSI2C available
				on Exynos5250 and Exynos5420 SoCs.
	-> "samsung,exynos5260-hsi2c", for i2c compatible with HSI2C available
				on Exynos5260 SoCs.

  - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.
  - interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
  - #address-cells: always 1 (for i2c addresses)
  - #size-cells: always 0

  - Pinctrl:
    - pinctrl-0: Pin control group to be used for this controller.
    - pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default".

Optional properties:
  - clock-frequency: Desired operating frequency in Hz of the bus.
    -> If not specified, the bus operates in fast-speed mode at
       at 100khz.
    -> If specified, the bus operates in high-speed mode only if the
       clock-frequency is >= 1Mhz.

Example:

hsi2c@12ca0000 {
	compatible = "samsung,exynos5250-hsi2c";
	reg = <0x12ca0000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <56>;
	clock-frequency = <100000>;

	pinctrl-0 = <&i2c4_bus>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	s2mps11_pmic@66 {
		compatible = "samsung,s2mps11-pmic";
		reg = <0x66>;
	};
};
