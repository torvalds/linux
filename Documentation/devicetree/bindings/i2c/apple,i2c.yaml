description: |
  Apple SoCs such as the M1 come with a I2C controller based on the one found
  in machines with P. A. Semi's PWRficient processors.
  The bus is used to communicate with e.g. USB PD chips or the speaker
  amp.

  clock-frequency:
    description: |
      Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz. If not specified, 100 kHz will be
      used. This frequency is generated by dividing the reference clock.
      Allowed values are between ref_clk/(16*4) and ref_clk/(16*255).
