description: |
  An i2c gate is useful to e.g. reduce the digital noise for RF tuners connected
  to the i2c bus. Gates are similar to arbitrators in that you need to perform
  some kind of operation to access the i2c bus past the arbitrator/gate, but
  there are no competing masters to consider for gates and therefore there is
  no arbitration happening for gates.
