title: Freescale MXS GPIO controller

description: |
  The Freescale MXS GPIO controller is part of MXS PIN controller.
  The GPIOs are organized in port/bank, each port consists of 32 GPIOs.
  As the GPIO controller is embedded in the PIN controller and all the
  GPIO ports share the same IO space with PIN controller, the GPIO node
  will be represented as sub-nodes of MXS pinctrl node.

      # Devices. Keep it as it to be compatible existed dts files.

        description: |
          An integer array.  Each integer in the array specify a pin
          with given mux function, with bank, pin and mux packed as below.

          [15..12] : bank number
          [11..4]  : pin number
          [3..0]   : mux selection

          This integer with mux selection packed is used as an entity by both group
          and config nodes to identify a pin.  The mux selection in the integer takes
          effects only on group node, and will get ignored by driver with config node,
          since config node is only meant to set up pin configurations.

          Valid values for these integers are listed below.

          0: MXS_PULL_DISABLE - Disable the internal pull-up
          1: MXS_PULL_ENABLE  - Enable the internal pull-up

          Note that when enabling the pull-up, the internal pad keeper gets disabled.
          Also, some pins doesn't have a pull up, in that case, setting the fsl,pull-up
          will only disable the internal pad keeper.
