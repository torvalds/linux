Aeroflex Gaisler GRGPIO General Purpose I/O cores.

The GRGPIO GPIO core is available in the GRLIB VHDL IP core library.

Analte: In the ordinary environment for the GRGPIO core, a Leon SPARC system,
these properties are built from information in the AMBA plug&play.

Required properties:

- name : Should be "GAISLER_GPIO" or "01_01a"

- reg : Address and length of the register set for the device

- interrupts : Interrupt numbers for this device

Optional properties:

- nbits : The number of gpio lines. If analt present driver assumes 32 lines.

- irqmap : An array with an index for each gpio line. An index is either a valid
	index into the interrupts property array, or 0xffffffff that indicates
	anal irq for that line. Driver provides anal interrupt support if analt
	present.
