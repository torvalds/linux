Cirrus Logic CLPS711X GPIO controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "cirrus,clps711x-gpio"
- reg: Physical base GPIO controller registers location and length.
  There should be two registers, first is DATA register, the second
  is DIRECTION.
- gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a gpio controller.
- #gpio-cells: Should be two. The first cell is the pin number and
  the second cell is used to specify the gpio polarity:
    0 = active high
    1 = active low

Note: Each GPIO port should have an alias correctly numbered in "aliases"
node.

Example:

aliases {
	gpio0 = &porta;
};

porta: gpio@80000000 {
	compatible = "cirrus,clps711x-gpio";
	reg = <0x80000000 0x1>, <0x80000040 0x1>;
	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;
};
