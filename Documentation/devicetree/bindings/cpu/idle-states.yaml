  ==========================================
  1 - Introduction
  ==========================================

  ARM and RISC-V systems contain HW capable of managing power consumption
  dynamically, where cores can be put in different low-power states (ranging
  from simple wfi to power gating) according to OS PM policies. The CPU states
  representing the range of dynamic idle states that a processor can enter at
  run-time, can be specified through device tree bindings representing the
  parameters required to enter/exit specific idle states on a given processor.

  ==========================================
  2 - ARM idle states
  ==========================================

  According to the Server Base System Architecture document (SBSA, [3]), the
  power states an ARM CPU can be put into are identified by the following list:

  - Running
  - Idle_standby
  - Idle_retention
  - Sleep
  - Off

  The power states described in the SBSA document define the basic CPU states on
  top of which ARM platforms implement power management schemes that allow an OS
  PM implementation to put the processor in different idle states (which include
  states listed above; "off" state is not an idle state since it does not have
  wake-up capabilities, hence it is not considered in this document).

  Idle state parameters (e.g. entry latency) are platform specific and need to
  be characterized with bindings that provide the required information to OS PM
  code so that it can build the required tables and use them at runtime.

  The device tree binding definition for ARM idle states is the subject of this
  document.

  ==========================================
  3 - RISC-V idle states
  ==========================================

  On RISC-V systems, the HARTs (or CPUs) [6] can be put in platform specific
  suspend (or idle) states (ranging from simple WFI, power gating, etc). The
  RISC-V SBI v0.3 (or higher) [7] hart state management extension provides a
  standard mechanism for OS to request HART state transitions.

  The platform specific suspend (or idle) states of a hart can be either
  retentive or non-rententive in nature. A retentive suspend state will
  preserve HART registers and CSR values for all privilege modes whereas
  a non-retentive suspend state will not preserve HART registers and CSR
  values.

  ===========================================
  4 - idle-states definitions
  ===========================================

  Idle states are characterized for a specific system through a set of
  timing and energy related properties, that underline the HW behaviour
  triggered upon idle states entry and exit.

  The following diagram depicts the CPU execution phases and related timing
  properties required to enter and exit an idle state:

  ..__[EXEC]__|__[PREP]__|__[ENTRY]__|__[IDLE]__|__[EXIT]__|__[EXEC]__..
              |          |           |          |          |

              |<------ entry ------->|
              |       latency        |
                                                |<- exit ->|
                                                |  latency |
              |<-------- min-residency -------->|
                         |<-------  wakeup-latency ------->|

      Diagram 1: CPU idle state execution phases

  EXEC:  Normal CPU execution.

  PREP:  Preparation phase before committing the hardware to idle mode
    like cache flushing. This is abortable on pending wake-up
    event conditions. The abort latency is assumed to be negligible
    (i.e. less than the ENTRY + EXIT duration). If aborted, CPU
    goes back to EXEC. This phase is optional. If not abortable,
    this should be included in the ENTRY phase instead.

  ENTRY:  The hardware is committed to idle mode. This period must run
    to completion up to IDLE before anything else can happen.

  IDLE:  This is the actual energy-saving idle period. This may last
    between 0 and infinite time, until a wake-up event occurs.

  EXIT:  Period during which the CPU is brought back to operational
    mode (EXEC).

  entry-latency: Worst case latency required to enter the idle state. The
  exit-latency may be guaranteed only after entry-latency has passed.

  min-residency: Minimum period, including preparation and entry, for a given
  idle state to be worthwhile energywise.

  wakeup-latency: Maximum delay between the signaling of a wake-up event and the
  CPU being able to execute normal code again. If not specified, this is assumed
  to be entry-latency + exit-latency.

  These timing parameters can be used by an OS in different circumstances.

  An idle CPU requires the expected min-residency time to select the most
  appropriate idle state based on the expected expiry time of the next IRQ
  (i.e. wake-up) that causes the CPU to return to the EXEC phase.

  An operating system scheduler may need to compute the shortest wake-up delay
  for CPUs in the system by detecting how long will it take to get a CPU out
  of an idle state, e.g.:

  wakeup-delay = exit-latency + max(entry-latency - (now - entry-timestamp), 0)

  In other words, the scheduler can make its scheduling decision by selecting
  (e.g. waking-up) the CPU with the shortest wake-up delay.
  The wake-up delay must take into account the entry latency if that period
  has not expired. The abortable nature of the PREP period can be ignored
  if it cannot be relied upon (e.g. the PREP deadline may occur much sooner than
  the worst case since it depends on the CPU operating conditions, i.e. caches
  state).

  An OS has to reliably probe the wakeup-latency since some devices can enforce
  latency constraint guarantees to work properly, so the OS has to detect the
  worst case wake-up latency it can incur if a CPU is allowed to enter an
  idle state, and possibly to prevent that to guarantee reliable device
  functioning.

  The min-residency time parameter deserves further explanation since it is
  expressed in time units but must factor in energy consumption coefficients.

  The energy consumption of a cpu when it enters a power state can be roughly
  characterised by the following graph:

                 |
                 |
                 |
             e   |
             n   |                                      /---
             e   |                               /------
             r   |                        /------
             g   |                  /-----
             y   |           /------
                 |       ----
                 |      /|
                 |     / |
                 |    /  |
                 |   /   |
                 |  /    |
                 | /     |
                 |/      |
            -----|-------+----------------------------------
                0|       1                              time(ms)

      Graph 1: Energy vs time example

  The graph is split in two parts delimited by time 1ms on the X-axis.
  The graph curve with X-axis values = { x | 0 < x < 1ms } has a steep slope
  and denotes the energy costs incurred while entering and leaving the idle
  state.
  The graph curve in the area delimited by X-axis values = {x | x > 1ms } has
  shallower slope and essentially represents the energy consumption of the idle
  state.

  min-residency is defined for a given idle state as the minimum expected
  residency time for a state (inclusive of preparation and entry) after
  which choosing that state become the most energy efficient option. A good
  way to visualise this, is by taking the same graph above and comparing some
  states energy consumptions plots.

  For sake of simplicity, let's consider a system with two idle states IDLE1,
  and IDLE2:

            |
            |
            |
            |                                                  /-- IDLE1
         e  |                                              /---
         n  |                                         /----
         e  |                                     /---
         r  |                                /-----/--------- IDLE2
         g  |                    /-------/---------
         y  |        ------------    /---|
            |       /           /----    |
            |      /        /---         |
            |     /    /----             |
            |    / /---                  |
            |   ---                      |
            |  /                         |
            | /                          |
            |/                           |                  time
         ---/----------------------------+------------------------
            |IDLE1-energy < IDLE2-energy | IDLE2-energy < IDLE1-energy
                                         |
                                  IDLE2-min-residency

      Graph 2: idle states min-residency example

  In graph 2 above, that takes into account idle states entry/exit energy
  costs, it is clear that if the idle state residency time (i.e. time till next
  wake-up IRQ) is less than IDLE2-min-residency, IDLE1 is the better idle state
  choice energywise.

  This is mainly down to the fact that IDLE1 entry/exit energy costs are lower
  than IDLE2.

  However, the lower power consumption (i.e. shallower energy curve slope) of
  idle state IDLE2 implies that after a suitable time, IDLE2 becomes more energy
  efficient.

  The time at which IDLE2 becomes more energy efficient than IDLE1 (and other
  shallower states in a system with multiple idle states) is defined
  IDLE2-min-residency and corresponds to the time when energy consumption of
  IDLE1 and IDLE2 states breaks even.

  The definitions provided in this section underpin the idle states
  properties specification that is the subject of the following sections.

  ===========================================
  5 - idle-states node
  ===========================================

  The processor idle states are defined within the idle-states node, which is
  a direct child of the cpus node [1] and provides a container where the
  processor idle states, defined as device tree nodes, are listed.

  On ARM systems, it is a container of processor idle states nodes. If the
  system does not provide CPU power management capabilities, or the processor
  just supports idle_standby, an idle-states node is not required.

  ===========================================
  6 - Qualcomm specific STATES
  ===========================================

  Idle states have different enter/exit latency and residency values.
  The idle states supported by the QCOM SoC are defined as -

    * Standby
    * Retention
    * Standalone Power Collapse (Standalone PC or SPC)
    * Power Collapse (PC)

  Standby: Standby does a little more in addition to architectural clock gating.
  When the WFI instruction is executed the ARM core would gate its internal
  clocks. In addition to gating the clocks, QCOM cpus use this instruction as a
  trigger to execute the SPM state machine. The SPM state machine waits for the
  interrupt to trigger the core back in to active. This triggers the cache
  hierarchy to enter standby states, when all cpus are idle. An interrupt brings
  the SPM state machine out of its wait, the next step is to ensure that the
  cache hierarchy is also out of standby, and then the cpu is allowed to resume
  execution. This state is defined as a generic ARM WFI state by the ARM cpuidle
  driver and is not defined in the DT. The SPM state machine should be
  configured to execute this state by default and after executing every other
  state below.

  Retention: Retention is a low power state where the core is clock gated and
  the memory and the registers associated with the core are retained. The
  voltage may be reduced to the minimum value needed to keep the processor
  registers active. The SPM should be configured to execute the retention
  sequence and would wait for interrupt, before restoring the cpu to execution
  state. Retention may have a slightly higher latency than Standby.

  Standalone PC: A cpu can power down and warmboot if there is a sufficient time
  between the time it enters idle and the next known wake up. SPC mode is used
  to indicate a core entering a power down state without consulting any other
  cpu or the system resources. This helps save power only on that core.  The SPM
  sequence for this idle state is programmed to power down the supply to the
  core, wait for the interrupt, restore power to the core, and ensure the
  system state including cache hierarchy is ready before allowing core to
  resume. Applying power and resetting the core causes the core to warmboot
  back into Elevation Level (EL) which trampolines the control back to the
  kernel. Entering a power down state for the cpu, needs to be done by trapping
  into a EL. Failing to do so, would result in a crash enforced by the warm boot
  code in the EL for the SoC. On SoCs with write-back L1 cache, the cache has to
  be flushed in s/w, before powering down the core.

  Power Collapse: This state is similar to the SPC mode, but distinguishes
  itself in that the cpu acknowledges and permits the SoC to enter deeper sleep
  modes. In a hierarchical power domain SoC, this means L2 and other caches can
  be flushed, system bus, clocks - lowered, and SoC main XO clock gated and
  voltages reduced, provided all cpus enter this state.  Since the span of low
  power modes possible at this state is vast, the exit latency and the residency
  of this low power mode would be considered high even though at a cpu level,
  this essentially is cpu power down. The SPM in this state also may handshake
  with the Resource power manager (RPM) processor in the SoC to indicate a
  complete application processor subsystem shut down.

      Each state node represents an idle state description and must be defined
      as follows.

      The idle state entered by executing the wfi instruction (idle_standby
      SBSA,[3][4]) is considered standard on all ARM and RISC-V platforms and
      therefore must not be listed.

      In addition to the properties listed above, a state node may require
      additional properties specific to the entry-method defined in the
      idle-states node. Please refer to the entry-method bindings
