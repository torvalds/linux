* Samsung Exynos Power Domains

Exynos processors include support for multiple power domains which are used
to gate power to one or more peripherals on the processor.

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following.
    * samsung,exynos4210-pd - for exynos4210 type power domain.
    * samsung,exynos5433-pd - for exynos5433 type power domain.
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.
- #power-domain-cells: number of cells in power domain specifier;
    must be 0.

Optional Properties:
- label: Human readable string with domain name. Will be visible in userspace
	to let user to distinguish between multiple domains in SoC.
- clocks: List of clock handles. The parent clocks of the input clocks to the
	devices in this power domain are set to oscclk before power gating
	and restored back after powering on a domain. This is required for
	all domains which are powered on and off and not required for unused
	domains.
- clock-names: The following clocks can be specified:
	- oscclk: Oscillator clock.
	- clkN: Input clocks to the devices in this power domain. These clocks
		will be reparented to oscclk before switching power domain off.
		Their original parent will be brought back after turning on
		the domain. Maximum of 4 clocks (N = 0 to 3) are supported.
	- asbN: Clocks required by asynchronous bridges (ASB) present in
		the power domain. These clock should be enabled during power
		domain on/off operations.
- power-domains: phandle pointing to the parent power domain, for more details
		 see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt

Node of a device using power domains must have a power-domains property
defined with a phandle to respective power domain.

Example:

	lcd0: power-domain-lcd0 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-pd";
		reg = <0x10023C00 0x10>;
		#power-domain-cells = <0>;
		label = "LCD0";
	};

	mfc_pd: power-domain@10044060 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-pd";
		reg = <0x10044060 0x20>;
		clocks = <&clock CLK_FIN_PLL>, <&clock CLK_MOUT_USER_ACLK333>;
		clock-names = "oscclk", "clk0";
		#power-domain-cells = <0>;
		label = "MFC";
	};

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt for description
of consumer-side bindings.
