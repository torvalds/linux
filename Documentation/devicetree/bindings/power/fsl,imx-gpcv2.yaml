description: |
  The i.MX7S/D General Power Control (GPC) block contains Power Gating
  Control (PGC) for various power domains.

  Power domains contained within GPC node are generic power domain
  providers, documented in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power-domain.yaml, which are
  described as subnodes of the power gating controller 'pgc' node.

  IP cores belonging to a power domain should contain a 'power-domains'
  property that is a phandle for PGC node representing the domain.

              A number of phandles to resets that need to be asserted during
              power-up sequencing of the domain. The resets belong to devices
              located inside the power domain, which need to be held in reset
              across the power-up sequence. So no means to specify what each
              reset is in a generic power-domain binding.
