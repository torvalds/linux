title: AXP20x AC power-supply

description: |
  The AXP20X can read the current current and voltage supplied by AC by
  reading ADC channels from the AXP20X ADC. The AXP22X is only able to
  tell if an AC power supply is present and usable. AXP813/AXP803 are
  able to limit current and supply voltage
