description: |
  The LTC ® 4162-L is an advanced monolithic synchronous step-down switching
  battery charger and PowerPath (TM) manager that seamlessly manages power
  distribution between input sources such as wall adapters, backplanes, solar
  panels, etc., and a rechargeable Lithium-Ion/Polymer battery.

  Specifications about the charger can be found at:
    https://www.analog.com/en/products/ltc4162-s.html

  lltc,rsnsb-micro-ohms:
    description: Battery sense resistor in microohm.
    minimum: 1000

  lltc,rsnsi-micro-ohms:
    description: Input current sense resistor in microohm.
    minimum: 1000

    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      Number of battery cells. If not provided, will be obtained from the chip
      once the external power is applied. Omit this when the number of cells
      is somewhat dynamic. Without it, several measurements will return 0 until
      the charger is connected to an external supply.
