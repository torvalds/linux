title: Binding for LTC2941, LTC2942, LTC2943 and LTC2944 battery fuel gauges

description: |
  All chips measure battery capacity.
  The LTC2942 is pin compatible with the LTC2941, it adds voltage and
  temperature monitoring, and is runtime detected. LTC2943 and LTC2944
  are software compatible, uses a slightly different conversion formula
  for the charge counter and adds voltage, current and temperature monitoring.

  lltc,resistor-sense:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/int32
    description: |
      Sense resistor value in milli-ohms.
      Can be negative value when the battery has been connected to the wrong end of the resistor.

  lltc,prescaler-exponent:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: |
      The prescaler exponent as explained in the datasheet.
      This determines the range and accuracy of the gauge.
      The value is programmed into the chip only if it differs from the current setting.
      The setting is lost when the battery is disconnected.
