      A priority ranging from 0 to 255 according to the following guidelines::
        0::   Restart handler of last resort, with limited restart capabilities.
        128:: Typical, default restart handler; use if no other restart handler
              is expected to be available, and/or if restart functionality is
              sufficient to restart the entire system.
        255:: Highest priority restart handler, will preempt all other restart handlers.
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 255
