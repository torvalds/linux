  Any property defined as part of the core regulator binding, defined in
  regulator.txt, can also be used.

  regulator-name: true

  enable-gpios:
    description: GPIO to use to enable/disable the regulator.
      Warning, the GPIO phandle flags are ignored and the GPIO polarity is
      controlled solely by the presence of "enable-active-high" DT property.
      This is due to compatibility with old DTs.

  gpios-states:
    description: |
      On operating systems, that don't support reading back gpio values in
      output mode (most notably linux), this array provides the state of GPIO
      pins set when requesting them from the gpio controller. Systems, that are
      capable of preserving state when requesting the lines, are free to ignore
      this property.
        0: LOW
        1: HIGH
      Default is LOW if nothing else is specified.
