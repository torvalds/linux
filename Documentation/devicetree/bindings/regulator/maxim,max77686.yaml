  This is a part of device tree bindings for Maxim MAX77686 Power Management
  Integrated Circuit (PMIC).

  The Maxim MAX77686 provides high-efficiency Buck and 26 Low-DropOut (LDO)
  regulators.

  See also Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/maxim,max77686.yaml for
  additional information and example.
