    $ref: "/schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/string"

    description: Offset applied to voltages to compensate for voltage drops

  regulator-always-on:
    description: boolean, regulator should never be disabled
    type: boolean

  regulator-boot-on:
    description: bootloader/firmware enabled regulator.
      It's expected that this regulator was left on by the bootloader.
      If the bootloader didn't leave it on then OS should turn it on
      at boot but shouldn't prevent it from being turned off later.
      This property is intended to only be used for regulators where
      software cannot read the state of the regulator.
    type: boolean

  regulator-allow-bypass:
    description: allow the regulator to go into bypass mode
    type: boolean

  regulator-allow-set-load:
    description: allow the regulator performance level to be configured
    type: boolean

  regulator-ramp-delay:
    description: ramp delay for regulator(in uV/us) For hardware which supports
      disabling ramp rate, it should be explicitly initialised to zero (regulator-ramp-delay
      = <0>) for disabling ramp delay.
    $ref: "/schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32"

  regulator-enable-ramp-delay:
    description: The time taken, in microseconds, for the supply rail to
      reach the target voltage, plus/minus whatever tolerance the board
      design requires. This property describes the total system ramp time
      required due to the combination of internal ramping of the regulator
      itself, and board design issues such as trace capacitance and load
      on the supply.

    description: Settling time, in microseconds, for voltage increase if
      the regulator needs a constant time to settle after voltage increases
