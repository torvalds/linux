title: QCOM SMD RPM REGULATOR

description:
  The Qualcomm RPM over SMD regulator is modelled as a subdevice of the RPM.
  Because SMD is used as the communication transport mechanism, the RPM
  resides as a subnode of the SMD.  As such, the SMD-RPM regulator requires
  that the SMD and RPM nodes be present.

  Please refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/qcom/qcom,smd.txt for
  information pertaining to the SMD node.

  Please refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/qcom/qcom,smd-rpm.yaml
  for information regarding the RPM node.

  The regulator node houses sub-nodes for each regulator within the device.
  Each sub-node is identified using the node's name, with valid values listed
  for each of the pmics below.
