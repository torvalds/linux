description: |
  This is a part of device tree bindings for S2M and S5M family of Power
  Management IC (PMIC).

  The S2MPA01 provides buck and LDO regulators.

  See also Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/samsung,s2mpa01.yaml for
  additional information and example.

    properties:
      regulator-ramp-delay:
        enum: [0, 6250, 12500, 25000, 50000]
        default: 12500
        description: |
          May be 0 for disabling the ramp delay on BUCK{1,2,3,4}.

          In the absence of the regulator-ramp-delay property, the default ramp
          delay will be used.

          Note: Some bucks share the ramp rate setting i.e. same ramp value
          will be set for a particular group of bucks so provide the same
          regulator-ramp-delay value for them.
          Groups sharing ramp rate:
            * buck{1,6},
            * buck{2,4},
            * buck{8,9,10}.
