* palmas regulator IP block devicetree bindings

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be from the list
  ti,twl6035-pmic
  ti,twl6036-pmic
  ti,twl6037-pmic
  ti,tps65913-pmic
  ti,tps65914-pmic
and also the generic series names
  ti,palmas-pmic
- interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller which is palmas.
- interrupts : The interrupt number and the type which can be looked up here:
	       arch/arm/boot/dts/include/dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h
- interrupts-name: The names of the individual interrupts.

Optional properties:
- ti,ldo6-vibrator : ldo6 is in vibrator mode

Optional nodes:
- regulators : Must contain a sub-node per regulator from the list below.
	       Each sub-node should contain the constraints and initialization
	       information for that regulator. See regulator.txt for a
	       description of standard properties for these sub-nodes.
	       Additional custom properties  are listed below.

	       For ti,palmas-pmic - smps12, smps123, smps3 depending on OTP,
	       smps45, smps457, smps7 depending on variant, smps6, smps[8-10],
	       ldo[1-9], ldoln, ldousb.

	       Optional sub-node properties:
	       ti,warm-reset - maintain voltage during warm reset(boolean)
	       ti,roof-floor - control voltage selection by pin(boolean)
	       ti,mode-sleep - mode to adopt in pmic sleep 0 - off, 1 - auto,
	       2 - eco, 3 - forced pwm
	       ti,smps-range - OTP has the wrong range set for the hardware so override
	       0 - low range, 1 - high range.

Example:

#include <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h>

pmic {
	compatible = "ti,twl6035-pmic", "ti,palmas-pmic";
	interrupt-parent = <&palmas>;
	interrupts = <14 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
	interrupts-name = "short-irq";

	ti,ldo6-vibrator;

	regulators {
		smps12_reg : smps12 {
			regulator-name = "smps12";
			regulator-min-microvolt = < 600000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1500000>;
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-boot-on;
			ti,warm-reset;
			ti,roof-floor;
			ti,mode-sleep = <0>;
			ti,smps-range = <1>;
		};

		ldo1_reg: ldo1 {
			regulator-name = "ldo1";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <2800000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <2800000>;
		};
	};
};
