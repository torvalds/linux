description: |
  List of regulators provided by this controller. BD71847 regulators node
  should be sub node of the BD71847 MFD node. See BD71847 MFD bindings at
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/rohm,bd71847-pmic.yaml
  Regulator nodes should be named to BUCK_<number> and LDO_<number>. The
  definition for each of these nodes is defined using the standard
  binding for regulators at
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.
  Note that if BD71847 starts at RUN state you probably want to use
  regulator-boot-on at least for BUCK5. LDO6 is supplied by it and it must
  not be disabled by driver at startup. If BUCK5 is disabled at startup the
  voltage monitoring for LDO5/LDO6 can cause PMIC to reset.

#The valid names for BD71847 regulator nodes are:
#BUCK1, BUCK2, BUCK3, BUCK4, BUCK5, BUCK6
#LDO1, LDO2, LDO3, LDO4, LDO5, LDO6

      # BD718(47/50) power outputs can either be controlled by the PMIC internal
      # hardware state machine or by software. If you need regulators to be
      # turned ON/OFF for example based on PMIC_STBY_REQ line (which toggles
      # PMIC HW state machine) - then you should set this property.
      # Tradeoff is that then SW can't control the ON/OFF state for this
      # regulator (other than invoking a PMIC state change).

      # Setups where regulator (especially the buck8) output voltage is scaled
      # by adding external connection where some other regulator output is
      # connected to feedback-pin (over suitable resistors) is getting popular
      # amongst users of BD71837. (This allows for example scaling down the
      # buck8 voltages to suit lover GPU voltages for projects where buck8 is
      # (ab)used to supply power for GPU.
      #
      # So we allow describing this external connection from DT and scale the
      # voltages accordingly. This is what the connection should look like:
      #
      # |---------------|
      # |       buck 8  |-------+----->Vout
      # |               |       |

      # Here the buck output is sifted according to formula:
      #
      # Vout_o = Vo - (Vpu - Vo)*R2/R1
      # Linear_step = step_orig*(R1+R2)/R1
      #
      # where:
      # Vout_o is adjusted voltage output at vsel reg value 0
      # Vo is original voltage output at vsel reg value 0
      # Vpu is the pull-up voltage V FB-pull-up in the picture
      # R1 and R2 are resistor values.
