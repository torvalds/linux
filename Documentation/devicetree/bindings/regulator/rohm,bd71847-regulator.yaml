  List of regulators provided by this controller. BD71847 regulators node
  should be sub node of the BD71847 MFD node. See BD71847 MFD bindings at
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/rohm,bd71847-pmic.yaml
  Regulator nodes should be named to BUCK_<number> and LDO_<number>. The
  definition for each of these nodes is defined using the standard
  binding for regulators at
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.
  Note that if BD71847 starts at RUN state you probably want to use
  regulator-boot-on at least for BUCK5. LDO6 is supplied by it and it must
  not be disabled by driver at startup. If BUCK5 is disabled at startup the
  voltage monitoring for LDO5/LDO6 can cause PMIC to reset.

#The valid names for BD71847 regulator nodes are:
#BUCK1, BUCK2, BUCK3, BUCK4, BUCK5, BUCK6
#LDO1, LDO2, LDO3, LDO4, LDO5, LDO6
