Xilinx AXI VDMA engine, it does transfers between memory and video devices.
It can be configured to have one channel or two channels. If configured
as two channels, one is to transmit to the video device and another is
to receive from the video device.

Xilinx AXI DMA engine, it does transfers between memory and AXI4 stream
target devices. It can be configured to have one channel or two channels.
If configured as two channels, one is to transmit to the device and another
is to receive from the device.

Xilinx AXI CDMA engine, it does transfers between memory-mapped source
address and a memory-mapped destination address.

Xilinx AXI MCDMA engine, it does transfer between memory and AXI4 stream
target devices. It can be configured to have up to 16 independent transmit
and receive channels.
