Xilinx ZynqMP DMA engine, it does support memory to memory transfers,
memory to device and device to memory transfers. It also has flow
control and rate control support for slave/peripheral dma access.

Required properties:
- compatible		: Should be "xlnx,zynqmp-dma-1.0"
- reg			: Memory map for gdma/adma module access.
- interrupt-parent	: Interrupt controller the interrupt is routed through
- interrupts		: Should contain DMA channel interrupt.
- xlnx,bus-width	: Axi buswidth in bits. Should contain 128 or 64
- clock-names		: List of input clocks "clk_main", "clk_apb"
			  (see clock bindings for details)

Optional properties:
- dma-coherent		: Present if dma operations are coherent.

Example:
++++++++
fpd_dma_chan1: dma@fd500000 {
	compatible = "xlnx,zynqmp-dma-1.0";
	reg = <0x0 0xFD500000 0x1000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
	interrupts = <0 117 4>;
	clock-names = "clk_main", "clk_apb";
	xlnx,bus-width = <128>;
	dma-coherent;
};
