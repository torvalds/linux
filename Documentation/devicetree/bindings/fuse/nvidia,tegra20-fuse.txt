NVIDIA Tegra20/Tegra30/Tegr114/Tegra124 fuse block.

Required properties:
- compatible : For Tegra20, must contain "nvidia,tegra20-efuse".  For Tegra30,
  must contain "nvidia,tegra30-efuse".  For Tegra114, must contain
  "nvidia,tegra114-efuse".  For Tegra124, must contain "nvidia,tegra124-efuse".
  For Tegra132 must contain "nvidia,tegra132-efuse", "nvidia,tegra124-efuse".
  For Tegra210 must contain "nvidia,tegra210-efuse". For Tegra186 must contain
  "nvidia,tegra186-efuse". For Tegra194 must contain "nvidia,tegra194-efuse".
  Details:
  nvidia,tegra20-efuse: Tegra20 requires using APB DMA to read the fuse data
	due to a hardware bug. Tegra20 also lacks certain information which is
	available in later generations such as fab code, lot code, wafer id,..
  nvidia,tegra30-efuse, nvidia,tegra114-efuse and nvidia,tegra124-efuse:
	The differences between these SoCs are the size of the efuse array,
	the location of the spare (OEM programmable) bits and the location of
	the speedo data.
- reg: Should contain 1 entry: the entry gives the physical address and length
       of the fuse registers.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  - fuse
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
 - fuse

Example:

	fuse@7000f800 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-efuse";
		reg = <0x7000f800 0x400>,
		      <0x70000000 0x400>;
		clocks = <&tegra_car TEGRA20_CLK_FUSE>;
		clock-names = "fuse";
		resets = <&tegra_car 39>;
		reset-names = "fuse";
	};
