* Solomon SSD1307 Framebuffer Driver

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "solomon,<chip>fb-<bus>". The only supported bus for
    now is i2c, and the supported chips are ssd1305, ssd1306 and ssd1307.
  - reg: Should contain address of the controller on the I2C bus. Most likely
         0x3c or 0x3d
  - pwm: Should contain the pwm to use according to the OF device tree PWM
         specification [0]. Only required for the ssd1307.
  - reset-gpios: Should contain the GPIO used to reset the OLED display
  - solomon,height: Height in pixel of the screen driven by the controller
  - solomon,width: Width in pixel of the screen driven by the controller
  - solomon,page-offset: Offset of pages (band of 8 pixels) that the screen is
    mapped to.

Optional properties:
  - reset-active-low: Is the reset gpio is active on physical low?
  - solomon,segment-no-remap: Display needs normal (non-inverted) data column
                              to segment mapping
  - solomon,com-seq: Display uses sequential COM pin configuration
  - solomon,com-lrremap: Display uses left-right COM pin remap
  - solomon,com-invdir: Display uses inverted COM pin scan direction
  - solomon,com-offset: Number of the COM pin wired to the first display line
  - solomon,prechargep1: Length of deselect period (phase 1) in clock cycles.
  - solomon,prechargep2: Length of precharge period (phase 2) in clock cycles.
                         This needs to be the higher, the higher the capacitance
                         of the OLED's pixels is

Examples:
ssd1307: oled@3c {
        compatible = "solomon,ssd1307fb-i2c";
        reg = <0x3c>;
        pwms = <&pwm 4 3000>;
        reset-gpios = <&gpio2 7>;
        reset-active-low;
};

ssd1306: oled@3c {
        compatible = "solomon,ssd1306fb-i2c";
        reg = <0x3c>;
        pwms = <&pwm 4 3000>;
        reset-gpios = <&gpio2 7>;
        reset-active-low;
        solomon,com-lrremap;
        solomon,com-invdir;
        solomon,com-offset = <32>;
};
