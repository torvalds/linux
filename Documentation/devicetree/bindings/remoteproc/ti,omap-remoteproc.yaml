description:
  The OMAP family of SoCs usually have one or more slave processor sub-systems
  that are used to offload some of the processor-intensive tasks, or to manage
  other hardware accelerators, for achieving various system level goals.

  The processor cores in the sub-system are usually behind an IOMMU, and may
  contain additional sub-modules like Internal RAM and/or ROMs, L1 and/or L2
  caches, an Interrupt Controller, a Cache Controller etc.

  The OMAP SoCs usually have a DSP processor sub-system and/or an IPU processor
  sub-system. The DSP processor sub-system can contain any of the TI's C64x,
  C66x or C67x family of DSP cores as the main execution unit. The IPU processor
  sub-system usually contains either a Dual-Core Cortex-M3 or Dual-Core
  Cortex-M4 processors.

  Each remote processor sub-system is represented as a single DT node. Each node
  has a number of required or optional properties that enable the OS running on
  the host processor (MPU) to perform the device management of the remote
  processor and to communicate with the remote processor. The various properties
  can be classified as constant or variable. The constant properties are
  dictated by the SoC and does not change from one board to another having the
  same SoC. Examples of constant properties include 'iommus', 'reg'. The
  variable properties are dictated by the system integration aspects such as
  memory on the board, or configuration used within the corresponding firmware
  image. Examples of variable properties include 'mboxes', 'memory-region',
  'timers', 'watchdog-timers' etc.

    description: |
      phandles to OMAP IOMMU nodes, that need to be programmed
      for this remote processor to access any external RAM memory or
      other peripheral device address spaces. This property usually
      has only a single phandle. Multiple phandles are used only in
      cases where the sub-system has different ports for different
      sub-modules within the processor sub-system (eg: DRA7 DSPs),
      and need the same programming in both the MMUs.

      OMAP Mailbox specifier denoting the sub-mailbox, to be used for
      communication with the remote processor. The specifier format is
      as per the bindings,
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/ti,omap-mailbox.yaml
      This property should match with the sub-mailbox node used in
      the firmware image.

  firmware-name:
    description: |
      Default name of the firmware to load to the remote processor.

# Optional properties:
# --------------------
# Some of these properties are mandatory on some SoCs, and some are optional
# depending on the configuration of the firmware image to be executed on the
# remote processor. The conditions are mentioned for each property.
#
# The following are the optional properties:

  memory-region:
    maxItems: 1
    description: |
      phandle to the reserved memory node to be associated
      with the remoteproc device. The reserved memory node
      can be a CMA memory node, and should be defined as
      per the bindings,
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt

  reg:
    description: |
      Address space for any remoteproc memories present on
      the SoC. Should contain an entry for each value in
      'reg-names'. These are mandatory for all DSP and IPU
      processors that have them (OMAP4/OMAP5 DSPs do not have
      any RAMs)

  reg-names:
    description: |
      Required names for each of the address spaces defined in
      the 'reg' property. Expects the names from the following
      list, in the specified order, each representing the corresponding
      internal RAM memory region.

    description:
      This property is required for all the DSP instances on OMAP4, OMAP5
      and DRA7xx SoCs.

  ti,autosuspend-delay-ms:
    description: |
      Custom autosuspend delay for the remoteproc in milliseconds.
      Recommended values is preferable to be in the order of couple
      of seconds. A negative value can also be used to disable the
      autosuspend behavior.

  ti,timers:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/phandle-array
    items:
      maxItems: 1
    description: |
      One or more phandles to OMAP DMTimer nodes, that serve
      as System/Tick timers for the OS running on the remote
      processors. This will usually be a single timer if the
      processor sub-system is running in SMP mode, or one per
      core in the processor sub-system. This can also be used
      to reserve specific timers to be dedicated to the
      remote processors.

      This property is mandatory on remote processors requiring
      external tick wakeup, and to support Power Management
      features. The timers to be used should match with the
      timers used in the firmware image.

  ti,watchdog-timers:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/phandle-array
    items:
      maxItems: 1
    description: |
      One or more phandles to OMAP DMTimer nodes, used to
      serve as Watchdog timers for the processor cores. This
      will usually be one per executing processor core, even
      if the processor sub-system is running a SMP OS.

      The timers to be used should match with the watchdog
      timers used in the firmware image.
