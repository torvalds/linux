Qualcomm Hexagon Peripheral Image Loader

This document defines the binding for a component that loads and boots firmware
on the Qualcomm Hexagon core.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,q6v5-pil",

		    "qcom,msm8974-mss-pil"
		    "qcom,msm8996-mss-pil"
		    "qcom,sdm845-mss-pil"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: must specify the base address and size of the qdsp6 and
		    rmb register blocks

- reg-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "q6dsp" and "rmb"

- interrupts-extended:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: must list the watchdog, fatal IRQs ready, handover and
		    stop-ack IRQs

- interrupt-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "wdog", "fatal", "ready", "handover", "stop-ack"

- clocks:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the iface, bus and mem clocks to be held on
		    behalf of the booting of the Hexagon core

- clock-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "iface", "bus", "mem"

- resets:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the reset-controller for the modem sub-system
		    reference to the list of 3 reset-controllers for the
		    wcss sub-system

- reset-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "mss_restart" for the modem sub-system
	Definition: must be "wcss_aon_reset", "wcss_reset", "wcss_q6_reset"
		    for the wcss syb-system

- cx-supply:
- mss-supply:
- mx-supply:
- pll-supply:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the regulators to be held on behalf of the
		    booting of the Hexagon core

- qcom,smem-states:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the smem state for requesting the Hexagon to
		    shut down

- qcom,smem-state-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "stop"

- qcom,halt-regs:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: a phandle reference to a syscon representing TCSR followed
		    by the three offsets within syscon for q6, modem and nc
		    halt registers.

= SUBNODES:
The Hexagon node must contain two subnodes, named "mba" and "mpss" representing
the memory regions used by the Hexagon firmware. Each sub-node must contain:

- memory-region:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the reserved-memory for the region

The Hexagon node may also have an subnode named either "smd-edge" or
"glink-edge" that describes the communication edge, channels and devices
related to the Hexagon.  See ../soc/qcom/qcom,smd.txt and
../soc/qcom/qcom,glink.txt for details on how to describe these.

= EXAMPLE
The following example describes the resources needed to boot control the
Hexagon, as it is found on MSM8974 boards.

	modem-rproc@fc880000 {
		compatible = "qcom,q6v5-pil";
		reg = <0xfc880000 0x100>,
		      <0xfc820000 0x020>;
		reg-names = "qdsp6", "rmb";

		interrupts-extended = <&intc 0 24 1>,
				      <&modem_smp2p_in 0 0>,
				      <&modem_smp2p_in 1 0>,
				      <&modem_smp2p_in 2 0>,
				      <&modem_smp2p_in 3 0>;
		interrupt-names = "wdog",
				  "fatal",
				  "ready",
				  "handover",
				  "stop-ack";

		clocks = <&gcc GCC_MSS_Q6_BIMC_AXI_CLK>,
			 <&gcc GCC_MSS_CFG_AHB_CLK>,
			 <&gcc GCC_BOOT_ROM_AHB_CLK>;
		clock-names = "iface", "bus", "mem";

		qcom,halt-regs = <&tcsr_mutex_block 0x1180 0x1200 0x1280>;

		resets = <&gcc GCC_MSS_RESTART>;
		reset-names = "mss_restart";

		cx-supply = <&pm8841_s2>;
		mss-supply = <&pm8841_s3>;
		mx-supply = <&pm8841_s1>;
		pll-supply = <&pm8941_l12>;

		qcom,smem-states = <&modem_smp2p_out 0>;
		qcom,smem-state-names = "stop";

		mba {
			memory-region = <&mba_region>;
		};

		mpss {
			memory-region = <&mpss_region>;
