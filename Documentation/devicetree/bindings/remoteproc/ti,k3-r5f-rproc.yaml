description: |
  The TI K3 family of SoCs usually have one or more dual-core Arm Cortex R5F
  processor subsystems/clusters (R5FSS). The dual core cluster can be used
  either in a LockStep mode providing safety/fault tolerance features or in a
  Split mode providing two individual compute cores for doubling the compute
  capacity on most SoCs. These are used together with other processors present
  on the SoC to achieve various system level goals.

  AM64x SoCs do not support LockStep mode, but rather a new non-safety mode
  called "Single-CPU" mode, where only Core0 is used, but with ability to use
  Core1's TCMs as well.

  Each Dual-Core R5F sub-system is represented as a single DTS node
  representing the cluster, with a pair of child DT nodes representing
  the individual R5F cores. Each node has a number of required or optional
  properties that enable the OS running on the host processor to perform
  the device management of the remote processor and to communicate with the
  remote processor.

# R5F Processor Child Nodes:
# ==========================

    description: |
      The R5F Sub-System device node should define two R5F child nodes, each
      node representing a TI instantiation of the Arm Cortex R5F core. There
      are some specific integration differences for the IP like the usage of
      a Region Address Translator (RAT) for translating the larger SoC bus
      addresses into a 32-bit address space for the processor.

      Each R5F core has an associated 64 KB of Tightly-Coupled Memory (TCM)
      internal memories split between two banks - TCMA and TCMB (further
      interleaved into two banks TCMB0 and TCMB1). These memories (also called
      ATCM and BTCM) provide read/write performance on par with the core's L1
      caches. Each of the TCMs can be enabled or disabled independently and
      either of them can be configured to appear at that R5F's address 0x0.

      The cores do not use an MMU, but has a Region Address Translater
      (RAT) module that is accessible only from the R5Fs for providing
      translations between 32-bit CPU addresses into larger system bus
      addresses. Cache and memory access settings are provided through a
      Memory Protection Unit (MPU), programmable only from the R5Fs.
