Qualcomm ADSP Peripheral Image Loader

This document defines the binding for a component that loads and boots firmware
on the Qualcomm ADSP Hexagon core.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,msm8974-adsp-pil"
		    "qcom,msm8996-adsp-pil"

- interrupts-extended:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: must list the watchdog, fatal IRQs ready, handover and
		    stop-ack IRQs

- interrupt-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "wdog", "fatal", "ready", "handover", "stop-ack"

- clocks:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: reference to the xo clock to be held on behalf of the
		    booting Hexagon core

- clock-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "xo"

- cx-supply:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the regulator to be held on behalf of the
		    booting Hexagon core

- memory-region:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the reserved-memory for the ADSP

- qcom,smem-states:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: reference to the smem state for requesting the ADSP to
		    shut down

- qcom,smem-state-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "stop"


= SUBNODES
The adsp node may have an subnode named "smd-edge" that describes the SMD edge,
channels and devices related to the ADSP.  See ../soc/qcom/qcom,smd.txt for
details on how to describe the SMD edge.


= EXAMPLE
The following example describes the resources needed to boot control the
ADSP, as it is found on MSM8974 boards.

	adsp {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8974-adsp-pil";

		interrupts-extended = <&intc 0 162 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
				      <&adsp_smp2p_in 0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
				      <&adsp_smp2p_in 1 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
				      <&adsp_smp2p_in 2 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
				      <&adsp_smp2p_in 3 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		interrupt-names = "wdog",
				  "fatal",
				  "ready",
				  "handover",
				  "stop-ack";

		clocks = <&rpmcc RPM_CXO_CLK>;
		clock-names = "xo";

		cx-supply = <&pm8841_s2>;

		memory-region = <&adsp_region>;

		qcom,smem-states = <&adsp_smp2p_out 0>;
		qcom,smem-state-names = "stop";

		smd-edge {
			interrupts = <0 156 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;

			qcom,ipc = <&apcs 8 8>;
			qcom,smd-edge = <1>;
		};
	};
