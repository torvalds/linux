	Definition: must be "stop"


= SUBNODES
The adsp node may have an subnode named either "smd-edge" or "glink-edge" that
describes the communication edge, channels and devices related to the ADSP.
See ../soc/qcom/qcom,smd.txt and ../soc/qcom/qcom,glink.txt for details on how
to describe these.


= EXAMPLE
The following example describes the resources needed to boot control the
ADSP, as it is found on MSM8974 boards.

	adsp {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8974-adsp-pil";

		interrupts-extended = <&intc 0 162 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
				      <&adsp_smp2p_in 0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
				      <&adsp_smp2p_in 1 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
				      <&adsp_smp2p_in 2 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
				      <&adsp_smp2p_in 3 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		interrupt-names = "wdog",
				  "fatal",
				  "ready",
				  "handover",
				  "stop-ack";

		clocks = <&rpmcc RPM_CXO_CLK>;
		clock-names = "xo";

		cx-supply = <&pm8841_s2>;

		memory-region = <&adsp_region>;

		qcom,smem-states = <&adsp_smp2p_out 0>;
		qcom,smem-state-names = "stop";

		smd-edge {
			interrupts = <0 156 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;

			qcom,ipc = <&apcs 8 8>;
			qcom,smd-edge = <1>;
		};
	};

The following example describes the resources needed to boot control the
SLPI, as it is found on MSM8996 boards.

	slpi {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8996-slpi-pil";
		interrupts-extended = <&intc 0 390 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
				      <&slpi_smp2p_in 0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
				      <&slpi_smp2p_in 1 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
				      <&slpi_smp2p_in 2 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
				      <&slpi_smp2p_in 3 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		interrupt-names = "wdog",
				  "fatal",
				  "ready",
				  "handover",
				  "stop-ack";

		clocks = <&rpmcc MSM8996_RPM_SMD_XO_CLK_SRC>,
		         <&rpmcc MSM8996_RPM_SMD_AGGR2_NOC_CLK>;
		clock-names = "xo", "aggre2";

		cx-supply = <&pm8994_l26>;
		px-supply = <&pm8994_lvs2>;

		memory-region = <&slpi_region>;
		qcom,smem-states = <&slpi_smp2p_out 0>;
		qcom,smem-state-names = "stop";
        };
