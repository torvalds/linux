description: |
  The Xilinx platforms include a pair of Cortex-R5F processors (RPU) for
  real-time processing based on the Cortex-R5F processor core from ARM.
  The Cortex-R5F processor implements the Arm v7-R architecture and includes a
  floating-point unit that implements the Arm VFPv3 instruction set.

      The RPU MPCore can operate in split mode (Dual-processor performance), Safety
      lock-step mode(Both RPU cores execute the same code in lock-step,
      clock-for-clock) or Single CPU mode (RPU core 0 is held in reset while
      core 1 runs normally). The processor does not support dynamic configuration.
      Switching between modes is only permitted immediately after a processor reset.
      If set to  1 then lockstep mode and if 0 then split mode.
      If set to  2 then single CPU mode. When not defined, default will be lockstep mode.
      In summary,
      0: split mode
      1: lockstep mode (default)
      2: single cpu mode

      The RPU is located in the Low Power Domain of the Processor Subsystem.
      Each processor includes separate L1 instruction and data caches and
      tightly coupled memories (TCM). System memory is cacheable, but the TCM
      memory space is non-cacheable.

      Each RPU contains one 64KB memory and two 32KB memories that
      are accessed via the TCM A and B port interfaces, for a total of 128KB
      per processor. In lock-step mode, the processor has access to 256KB of
      TCM memory.

          phandles to one or more reserved on-chip SRAM regions. Other than TCM,
          the RPU can execute instructions and access data from the OCM memory,
          the main DDR memory, and other system memories.

          The regions should be defined as child nodes of the respective SRAM
          node, and should be defined as per the generic bindings in
          Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sram/sram.yaml

          the remote processor (e.g. remoteproc firmware and carveouts, rpmsg
          vrings, ...). This reserved memory region will be allocated in DDR memory.
