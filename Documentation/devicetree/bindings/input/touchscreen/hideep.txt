* HiDeep Finger and Stylus touchscreen controller

Required properties:
- compatible		: must be "hideep,hideep-ts"
- reg			: I2C slave address, (e.g. 0x6C).
- interrupt-parent : Interrupt controller to which the chip is connected.
- interrupts : Interrupt to which the chip is connected.

Optional properties:
- vdd-supply	: It is the controller supply for controlling
					 main voltage(3.3V) through the regulator.
- vid-supply	: It is the controller supply for controlling
					IO voltage(1.8V) through the regulator.
- reset-gpios	: Define for reset gpio pin.
						It is to use for reset IC.
- touchscreen-size-x	: X axis size of touchscreen
- touchscreen-size-y	: Y axis size of touchscreen
- linux,keycodes	: Specifies an array of numeric keycode values to
			be used for reporting button presses. The array can
			contain up to 3 entries.

Example:

#include "dt-bindings/input/input.h"

i2c@00000000 {

	/* ... */

	touchscreen@6c {
		compatible = "hideep,hideep-ts";
		reg = <0x6c>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpx1>;
		interrupts = <2 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		vdd-supply = <&ldo15_reg>;
		vid-supply = <&ldo18_reg>;
		reset-gpios = <&gpx1 5 0>;
		touchscreen-size-x = <1080>;
		touchscreen-size-y = <1920>;
		linux,keycodes = <KEY_HOME>, <KEY_MENU>, <KEY_BACK>;
	};
};
