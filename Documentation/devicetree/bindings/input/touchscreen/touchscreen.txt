General Touchscreen Properties:

Optional properties for Touchscreens:
 - touchscreen-min-size-x	: minimal reported horizontal resolution of
				  touchscreen (in pixels)
 - touchscreen-min-size-y	: minimal reported vertical resolution of
				  touchscreen (in pixels)
 - touchscreen-max-size-x	: maximal reported horizontal resolution of
				  touchscreen (in pixels)
 - touchscreen-max-size-y	: maximal reported vertical resolution of touchscreen
				  touchscreen (in pixels)
 - touchscreen-max-pressure	: maximum reported pressure (arbitrary range
				  dependent on the controller)
 - touchscreen-fuzz-x		: horizontal noise value of the absolute input
				  device (in pixels)
 - touchscreen-fuzz-y		: vertical noise value of the absolute input
				  device (in pixels)
 - touchscreen-fuzz-pressure	: pressure noise value of the absolute input
				  device (arbitrary range dependent on the
				  controller)
 - touchscreen-average-samples : Number of data samples which are averaged
				  for each read (valid values dependent on the
				  controller)
 - touchscreen-inverted-x	: X axis is inverted (boolean)
 - touchscreen-inverted-y	: Y axis is inverted (boolean)
 - touchscreen-swapped-x-y	: X and Y axis are swapped (boolean)
				  Swapping is done after inverting the axis
 - touchscreen-x-mm		: horizontal length in mm of the touchscreen
 - touchscreen-y-mm		: vertical length in mm of the touchscreen
