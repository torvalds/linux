Elantech I2C Touchscreen

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "elan,ekth3500".
- reg: I2C address of the chip.
- interrupt-parent: a phandle for the interrupt controller (see interrupt
  binding[0]).
- interrupts: interrupt to which the chip is connected (see interrupt
  binding[0]).

Optional properties:
- wakeup-source: touchscreen can be used as a wakeup source.
- pinctrl-names: should be "default" (see pinctrl binding [1]).
- pinctrl-0: a phandle pointing to the pin settings for the device (see
  pinctrl binding [1]).
- reset-gpios: reset gpio the chip is connected to.
- vcc33-supply: a phandle for the regulator supplying 3.3V power.
- vccio-supply: a phandle for the regulator supplying IO power.
