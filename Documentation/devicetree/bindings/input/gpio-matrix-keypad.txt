* GPIO driven matrix keypad device tree bindings

GPIO driven matrix keypad is used to interface a SoC with a matrix keypad.
The matrix keypad supports multiple row and column lines, a key can be
placed at each intersection of a unique row and a unique column. The matrix
keypad can sense a key-press and key-release by means of GPIO lines and
report the event using GPIO interrupts to the cpu.

Required Properties:
- compatible:		Should be "gpio-matrix-keypad"
- row-gpios:		List of gpios used as row lines. The gpio specifier
			for this property depends on the gpio controller to
			which these row lines are connected.
- col-gpios:		List of gpios used as column lines. The gpio specifier
			for this property depends on the gpio controller to
			which these column lines are connected.
- linux,keymap:		The definition can be found at
			bindings/input/matrix-keymap.txt

Optional Properties:
- linux,no-autorepeat:	do no enable autorepeat feature.
- wakeup-source:	use any event on keypad as wakeup event.
- debounce-delay-ms:	debounce interval in milliseconds
- col-scan-delay-us:	delay, measured in microseconds, that is needed
			before we can scan keypad after activating column gpio

Example:
	matrix-keypad {
		compatible = "gpio-matrix-keypad";
		debounce-delay-ms = <5>;
		col-scan-delay-us = <2>;

		row-gpios = <&gpio2 25 0
			     &gpio2 26 0
			     &gpio2 27 0>;

		col-gpios = <&gpio2 21 0
			     &gpio2 22 0>;

		linux,keymap = <0x0000008B
				0x0100009E
				0x02000069
				0x0001006A
				0x0101001C
				0x0201006C>;
	};
