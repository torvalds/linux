STMicroelectronics STi family Sysconfig Peripheral Powerdown Reset Controller
=============================================================================

This binding describes a reset controller device that is used to enable and
disable on-chip peripheral controllers such as USB and SATA, using
"powerdown" control bits found in the STi family SoC system configuration
registers. These have been grouped together into a single reset controller
device for convenience.

The actual action taken when powerdown is asserted is hardware dependent.
However, when asserted it may not be possible to access the hardware's
registers and after an assert/deassert sequence the hardware's previous state
may no longer be valid.

Please refer to reset.txt in this directory for common reset
controller binding usage.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "st,<chip>-powerdown"
	ex: "st,stih415-powerdown", "st,stih416-powerdown"
- #reset-cells: 1, see below

example:

	powerdown: powerdown-controller {
		#reset-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "st,stih415-powerdown";
	};


Specifying powerdown control of devices
=======================================

Device nodes should specify the reset channel required in their "resets"
property, containing a phandle to the powerdown device node and an
index specifying which channel to use, as described in reset.txt

example:

	usb1: usb@fe200000 {
		resets	= <&powerdown STIH41X_USB1_POWERDOWN>;
	};

Macro definitions for the supported reset channels can be found in:
