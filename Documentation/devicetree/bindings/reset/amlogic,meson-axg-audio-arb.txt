* Amlogic audio memory arbiter controller

The Amlogic Audio ARB is a simple device which enables or
disables the access of Audio FIFOs to DDR on AXG based SoC.

Required properties:
- compatible: 'amlogic,meson-axg-audio-arb'
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory
       mapped region.
- clocks: phandle to the fifo peripheral clock provided by the audio
	  clock controller.
- #reset-cells: must be 1.

Example on the A113 SoC:

arb: reset-controller@280 {
	compatible = "amlogic,meson-axg-audio-arb";
	reg = <0x0 0x280 0x0 0x4>;
	#reset-cells = <1>;
	clocks = <&clkc_audio AUD_CLKID_DDR_ARB>;
};
