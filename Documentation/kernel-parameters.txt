                          Kernel Parameters
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a consolidated list of the kernel parameters as implemented
(mostly) by the __setup() macro and sorted into English Dictionary order
(defined as ignoring all punctuation and sorting digits before letters in a
case insensitive manner), and with descriptions where known.

Module parameters for loadable modules are specified only as the
parameter name with optional '=' and value as appropriate, such as:

	modprobe usbcore blinkenlights=1

Module parameters for modules that are built into the kernel image
are specified on the kernel command line with the module name plus
'.' plus parameter name, with '=' and value if appropriate, such as:

	usbcore.blinkenlights=1

This document may not be entirely up to date and comprehensive. The command
"modinfo -p ${modulename}" shows a current list of all parameters of a loadable
module. Loadable modules, after being loaded into the running kernel, also
reveal their parameters in /sys/module/${modulename}/parameters/. Some of these
parameters may be changed at runtime by the command
"echo -n ${value} > /sys/module/${modulename}/parameters/${parm}".

The parameters listed below are only valid if certain kernel build options were
enabled and if respective hardware is present. The text in square brackets at
the beginning of each description states the restrictions within which a

In addition, the following text indicates that the option:

	BUGS=	Relates to possible processor bugs on the said processor.
	KNL	Is a kernel start-up parameter.
	BOOT	Is a boot loader parameter.

Parameters denoted with BOOT are actually interpreted by the boot
loader, and have no meaning to the kernel directly.
Do not modify the syntax of boot loader parameters without extreme
need or coordination with <Documentation/i386/boot.txt>.

There are also arch-specific kernel-parameters not documented here.
See for example <Documentation/x86_64/boot-options.txt>.

Note that ALL kernel parameters listed below are CASE SENSITIVE, and that
a trailing = on the name of any parameter states that that parameter will
be entered as an environment variable, whereas its absence indicates that
it will appear as a kernel argument readable via /proc/cmdline by programs
running once the system is up.

The number of kernel parameters is not limited, but the length of the
complete command line (parameters including spaces etc.) is limited to
a fixed number of characters. This limit depends on the architecture
and is between 256 and 4096 characters. It is defined in the file
./include/asm/setup.h as COMMAND_LINE_SIZE.

	idle=		[X86]
			Format: idle=poll or idle=mwait
			Poll forces a polling idle loop that can slightly improves the performance
			of waking up a idle CPU, but will use a lot of power and make the system
			run hot. Not recommended.
			idle=mwait. On systems which support MONITOR/MWAIT but the kernel chose
			to not use it because it doesn't save as much power as a normal idle
			loop use the MONITOR/MWAIT idle loop anyways. Performance should be the same
			as idle=poll.

	ignore_loglevel	[KNL]
			Ignore loglevel setting - this will print /all/
			kernel messages to the console. Useful for debugging.

	ihash_entries=	[KNL]

		off
			Disable intel iommu driver.
		igfx_off [Default Off]
			By default, gfx is mapped as normal device. If a gfx
			device has a dedicated DMAR unit, the DMAR unit is
			bypassed by not enabling DMAR with this option. In
			this case, gfx device will use physical address for
			DMA.
		forcedac [x86_64]
			With this option iommu will not optimize to look
			for io virtual address below 32 bit forcing dual
			address cycle on pci bus for cards supporting greater
			than 32 bit addressing. The default is to look
			for translation below 32 bit and if not available
			then look in the higher range.

	isolcpus=	[KNL,SMP] Isolate CPUs from the general scheduler.
			Format:
			<cpu number>,...,<cpu number>
			or
			<cpu number>-<cpu number>  (must be a positive range in ascending order)
			or a mixture
			<cpu number>,...,<cpu number>-<cpu number>
			This option can be used to specify one or more CPUs
			to isolate from the general SMP balancing and scheduling
			algorithms. The only way to move a process onto or off
			an "isolated" CPU is via the CPU affinity syscalls.
			<cpu number> begins at 0 and the maximum value is
			"number of CPUs in system - 1".

			This option is the preferred way to isolate CPUs. The
			alternative -- manually setting the CPU mask of all
			tasks in the system -- can cause problems and
			suboptimal load balancer performance.

	js=		[HW,JOY] Analog joystick
			See Documentation/input/joystick.txt.

	kernelcore=nn[KMG]	[KNL,X86-32,IA-64,PPC,X86-64] This parameter
			specifies the amount of memory usable by the kernel
			for non-movable allocations.  The requested amount is
			spread evenly throughout all nodes in the system. The
			remaining memory in each node is used for Movable
			pages. In the event, a node is too small to have both
			kernelcore and Movable pages, kernelcore pages will
			take priority and other nodes will have a larger number
			of kernelcore pages.  The Movable zone is used for the
			allocation of pages that may be reclaimed or moved
			by the page migration subsystem.  This means that
			HugeTLB pages may not be allocated from this zone.
			Note that allocations like PTEs-from-HighMem still
			use the HighMem zone if it exists, and the Normal
			zone if it does not.

	movablecore=nn[KMG]	[KNL,X86-32,IA-64,PPC,X86-64] This parameter
			is similar to kernelcore except it specifies the
			amount of memory used for migratable allocations.
			If both kernelcore and movablecore is specified,
			then kernelcore will be at *least* the specified
			value but may be more. If movablecore on its own
			is specified, the administrator must be careful
			that the amount of memory usable for all allocations
			is not too small.

	keepinitrd	[HW,ARM]

	kstack=N	[X86-32,X86-64] Print N words from the kernel stack
			in oops dumps.

	l2cr=		[PPC]

	logibm.irq=	[HW,MOUSE] Logitech Bus Mouse Driver
			Format: <irq>

	loglevel=	All Kernel Messages with a loglevel smaller than the
			console loglevel will be printed to the console. It can
			also be changed with klogd or other programs. The
			loglevels are defined as follows:

			0 (KERN_EMERG)		system is unusable
			1 (KERN_ALERT)		action must be taken immediately
			2 (KERN_CRIT)		critical conditions
			3 (KERN_ERR)		error conditions
			4 (KERN_WARNING)	warning conditions
			5 (KERN_NOTICE)		normal but significant condition

			is set in the kernel config file.

	logo.nologo	[FB] Disables display of the built-in Linux logo.
			This may be used to provide more screen space for
			kernel log messages and is useful when debugging
			kernel boot problems.

	lp=0		[LP]	Specify parallel ports to use, e.g,
	lp=port[,port...]	lp=none,parport0 (lp0 not configured, lp1 uses
	lp=reset		first parallel port). 'lp=0' disables the
	lp=auto			printer driver. 'lp=reset' (which can be
				specified in addition to the ports) causes
				attached printers to be reset. Using
				lp=port1,port2,... specifies the parallel ports
				to associate lp devices with, starting with
				lp0. A port specification may be 'none' to skip
				that lp device, or a parport name such as
				'parport0'. Specifying 'lp=auto' instead of a
				port specification list means that device IDs
				from each port should be examined, to see if
				an IEEE 1284-compliant printer is attached; if
				so, the driver will manage that printer.
				See also header of drivers/char/lp.c.

	lpj=n		[KNL]
			Sets loops_per_jiffy to given constant, thus avoiding
			time-consuming boot-time autodetection (up to 250 ms per
			CPU). 0 enables autodetection (default). To determine
			the correct value for your kernel, boot with normal
			autodetection and see what value is printed. Note that
			on SMP systems the preset will be applied to all CPUs,
			which is likely to cause problems if your CPUs need
			significantly divergent settings. An incorrect value
			will cause delays in the kernel to be wrong, leading to
			unpredictable I/O errors and other breakage. Although
			unlikely, in the extreme case this might damage your
			hardware.

				on several machines and they hang the machine
				when used, but on other computers it's the only
				way to get the interrupt routing table. Try
				this option if the kernel is unable to allocate
				IRQs or discover secondary PCI buses on your
				motherboard.
		rom		[X86-32] Assign address space to expansion ROMs.
				Use with caution as certain devices share
				address decoders between ROMs and other
				resources.
		irqmask=0xMMMM	[X86-32] Set a bit mask of IRQs allowed to be

				whatever the firmware may have done.
		usepirqmask	[X86-32] Honor the possible IRQ mask stored
				in the BIOS $PIR table. This is needed on

				or for PCI scanning.
		use_crs		[X86-32] Use _CRS for PCI resource
				allocation.

				so this option is a temporary workaround
				for broken drivers that don't call it.
		firmware	[ARM] Do not re-enumerate the bus but instead
				just use the configuration from the
				bootloader. This is currently used on
				IXP2000 systems where the bus has to be
				configured a certain way for adjunct CPUs.
		noearly		[X86] Don't do any early type 1 scanning.
				This might help on some broken boards which
				machine check when some devices' config space
				is read. But various workarounds are disabled
				and some IOMMU drivers will not work.
		bfsort		Sort PCI devices into breadth-first order.
				This sorting is done to get a device
				order compatible with older (<= 2.4) kernels.
		nobfsort	Don't sort PCI devices into breadth-first order.
		cbiosize=nn[KMG]	The fixed amount of bus space which is
				reserved for the CardBus bridge's IO window.
				The default value is 256 bytes.
		cbmemsize=nn[KMG]	The fixed amount of bus space which is
