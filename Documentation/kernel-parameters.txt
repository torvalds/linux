                          Kernel Parameters
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a consolidated list of the kernel parameters as implemented
(mostly) by the __setup() macro and sorted into English Dictionary order
(defined as ignoring all punctuation and sorting digits before letters in a
case insensitive manner), and with descriptions where known.

Module parameters for loadable modules are specified only as the
parameter name with optional '=' and value as appropriate, such as:

	modprobe usbcore blinkenlights=1

Module parameters for modules that are built into the kernel image
are specified on the kernel command line with the module name plus
'.' plus parameter name, with '=' and value if appropriate, such as:

	usbcore.blinkenlights=1

Hyphens (dashes) and underscores are equivalent in parameter names, so
	log_buf_len=1M print-fatal-signals=1
can also be entered as
	log-buf-len=1M print_fatal_signals=1


This document may not be entirely up to date and comprehensive. The command
"modinfo -p ${modulename}" shows a current list of all parameters of a loadable
module. Loadable modules, after being loaded into the running kernel, also
reveal their parameters in /sys/module/${modulename}/parameters/. Some of these
parameters may be changed at runtime by the command
"echo -n ${value} > /sys/module/${modulename}/parameters/${parm}".

The parameters listed below are only valid if certain kernel build options were
enabled and if respective hardware is present. The text in square brackets at

	XEN	Xen support is enabled

In addition, the following text indicates that the option:

	BUGS=	Relates to possible processor bugs on the said processor.
	KNL	Is a kernel start-up parameter.
	BOOT	Is a boot loader parameter.

Parameters denoted with BOOT are actually interpreted by the boot
loader, and have no meaning to the kernel directly.
Do not modify the syntax of boot loader parameters without extreme
need or coordination with <Documentation/x86/boot.txt>.

There are also arch-specific kernel-parameters not documented here.
See for example <Documentation/x86/x86_64/boot-options.txt>.

Note that ALL kernel parameters listed below are CASE SENSITIVE, and that
a trailing = on the name of any parameter states that that parameter will
be entered as an environment variable, whereas its absence indicates that
it will appear as a kernel argument readable via /proc/cmdline by programs
running once the system is up.

The number of kernel parameters is not limited, but the length of the
complete command line (parameters including spaces etc.) is limited to
a fixed number of characters. This limit depends on the architecture
and is between 256 and 4096 characters. It is defined in the file
./include/asm/setup.h as COMMAND_LINE_SIZE.

Finally, the [KMG] suffix is commonly described after a number of kernel
parameter values. These 'K', 'M', and 'G' letters represent the _binary_
multipliers 'Kilo', 'Mega', and 'Giga', equalling 2^10, 2^20, and 2^30
bytes respectively. Such letter suffixes can also be entirely omitted.


	acpi=		[HW,ACPI,X86]
			Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
			Format: { force | off | strict | noirq | rsdt }
			force -- enable ACPI if default was off
			off -- disable ACPI if default was on
			noirq -- do not use ACPI for IRQ routing
			strict -- Be less tolerant of platforms that are not
				strictly ACPI specification compliant.
			rsdt -- prefer RSDT over (default) XSDT
			copy_dsdt -- copy DSDT to memory

			See also Documentation/power/runtime_pm.txt, pci=noacpi

	acpi_rsdp=	[ACPI,EFI,KEXEC]
			Pass the RSDP address to the kernel, mostly used
			on machines running EFI runtime service to boot the
			second kernel for kdump.

	acpi_apic_instance=	[ACPI, IOAPIC]
			Format: <int>
			2: use 2nd APIC table, if available
			1,0: use 1st APIC table
			default: 0

	acpi_backlight=	[HW,ACPI]
			acpi_backlight=vendor
			acpi_backlight=video
			If set to vendor, prefer vendor specific driver
			(e.g. thinkpad_acpi, sony_acpi, etc.) instead
			of the ACPI video.ko driver.

	acpi.debug_layer=	[HW,ACPI,ACPI_DEBUG]
	acpi.debug_level=	[HW,ACPI,ACPI_DEBUG]
			Format: <int>
			CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG must be enabled to produce any ACPI
			debug output.  Bits in debug_layer correspond to a
			_COMPONENT in an ACPI source file, e.g.,
			    #define _COMPONENT ACPI_PCI_COMPONENT
			Bits in debug_level correspond to a level in
			ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT statements, e.g.,
			    ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT((ACPI_DB_INFO, ...
			The debug_level mask defaults to "info".  See
			Documentation/acpi/debug.txt for more information about
			debug layers and levels.

			Enable processor driver info messages:
			    acpi.debug_layer=0x20000000
			Enable PCI/PCI interrupt routing info messages:
			    acpi.debug_layer=0x400000
			Enable AML "Debug" output, i.e., stores to the Debug
			object while interpreting AML:
			    acpi.debug_layer=0xffffffff acpi.debug_level=0x2
			Enable all messages related to ACPI hardware:
			    acpi.debug_layer=0x2 acpi.debug_level=0xffffffff

			Some values produce so much output that the system is
			unusable.  The "log_buf_len" parameter may be useful
			if you need to capture more output.

	acpi_irq_balance [HW,ACPI]
			ACPI will balance active IRQs
			default in APIC mode

	acpi_irq_nobalance [HW,ACPI]
			ACPI will not move active IRQs (default)
			default in PIC mode

	acpi_irq_isa=	[HW,ACPI] If irq_balance, mark listed IRQs used by ISA
			Format: <irq>,<irq>...

	acpi_irq_pci=	[HW,ACPI] If irq_balance, clear listed IRQs for
			use by PCI
			Format: <irq>,<irq>...

	acpi_no_auto_ssdt	[HW,ACPI] Disable automatic loading of SSDT

	acpi_os_name=	[HW,ACPI] Tell ACPI BIOS the name of the OS
			Format: To spoof as Windows 98: ="Microsoft Windows"

	acpi_osi=	[HW,ACPI] Modify list of supported OS interface strings
			acpi_osi="string1"	# add string1 -- only one string
			acpi_osi="!string2"	# remove built-in string2
			acpi_osi=		# disable all strings

	acpi_pm_good	[X86]
			Override the pmtimer bug detection: force the kernel
			to assume that this machine's pmtimer latches its value
			and always returns good values.

	acpi_sci=	[HW,ACPI] ACPI System Control Interrupt trigger mode
			Format: { level | edge | high | low }

	acpi_serialize	[HW,ACPI] force serialization of AML methods

	acpi_skip_timer_override [HW,ACPI]
			Recognize and ignore IRQ0/pin2 Interrupt Override.
			For broken nForce2 BIOS resulting in XT-PIC timer.

	acpi_sleep=	[HW,ACPI] Sleep options
			Format: { s3_bios, s3_mode, s3_beep, s4_nohwsig,
				  old_ordering, nonvs, sci_force_enable }
			See Documentation/power/video.txt for information on
			s3_bios and s3_mode.
			s3_beep is for debugging; it makes the PC's speaker beep
			as soon as the kernel's real-mode entry point is called.
			s4_nohwsig prevents ACPI hardware signature from being
			used during resume from hibernation.
			old_ordering causes the ACPI 1.0 ordering of the _PTS
			control method, with respect to putting devices into
			low power states, to be enforced (the ACPI 2.0 ordering
			of _PTS is used by default).
			nonvs prevents the kernel from saving/restoring the
			ACPI NVS memory during suspend/hibernation and resume.
			sci_force_enable causes the kernel to set SCI_EN directly
			on resume from S1/S3 (which is against the ACPI spec,
			but some broken systems don't work without it).

	acpi_use_timer_override [HW,ACPI]
			Use timer override. For some broken Nvidia NF5 boards
			that require a timer override, but don't have HPET

	acpi_enforce_resources=	[ACPI]
			{ strict | lax | no }
			Check for resource conflicts between native drivers
			and ACPI OperationRegions (SystemIO and SystemMemory
			only). IO ports and memory declared in ACPI might be
			used by the ACPI subsystem in arbitrary AML code and
			can interfere with legacy drivers.
			strict (default): access to resources claimed by ACPI
			is denied; legacy drivers trying to access reserved
			resources will fail to bind to device using them.
			lax: access to resources claimed by ACPI is allowed;
			legacy drivers trying to access reserved resources
			will bind successfully but a warning message is logged.
			no: ACPI OperationRegions are not marked as reserved,
			no further checks are performed.

	add_efi_memmap	[EFI; X86] Include EFI memory map in
			kernel's map of available physical RAM.

	agp=		[AGP]
			{ off | try_unsupported }

				(may crash computer or cause data corruption)

	ALSA		[HW,ALSA]
			See Documentation/sound/alsa/alsa-parameters.txt

	alignment=	[KNL,ARM]
			Allow the default userspace alignment fault handler
			behaviour to be specified.  Bit 0 enables warnings,
			bit 1 enables fixups, and bit 2 sends a segfault.

	align_va_addr=	[X86-64]
			Align virtual addresses by clearing slice [14:12] when
			allocating a VMA at process creation time. This option
			gives you up to 3% performance improvement on AMD F15h
			machines (where it is enabled by default) for a
			CPU-intensive style benchmark, and it can vary highly in
			a microbenchmark depending on workload and compiler.

			32: only for 32-bit processes
			64: only for 64-bit processes
			on: enable for both 32- and 64-bit processes
			off: disable for both 32- and 64-bit processes

	alloc_snapshot	[FTRACE]
			Allocate the ftrace snapshot buffer on boot up when the
			main buffer is allocated. This is handy if debugging
			and you need to use tracing_snapshot() on boot up, and
			do not want to use tracing_snapshot_alloc() as it needs
			to be done where GFP_KERNEL allocations are allowed.

	amd_iommu=	[HW,X86-64]
			Pass parameters to the AMD IOMMU driver in the system.
			Possible values are:
			fullflush - enable flushing of IO/TLB entries when
				    they are unmapped. Otherwise they are
				    flushed before they will be reused, which
				    is a lot of faster
			off	  - do not initialize any AMD IOMMU found in
				    the system
			force_isolation - Force device isolation for all
					  devices. The IOMMU driver is not
					  allowed anymore to lift isolation
					  requirements as needed. This option
					  does not override iommu=pt

	amd_iommu_dump=	[HW,X86-64]
			Enable AMD IOMMU driver option to dump the ACPI table
			for AMD IOMMU. With this option enabled, AMD IOMMU
			driver will print ACPI tables for AMD IOMMU during
			IOMMU initialization.

	amijoy.map=	[HW,JOY] Amiga joystick support
			Map of devices attached to JOY0DAT and JOY1DAT
			Format: <a>,<b>
			See also Documentation/input/joystick.txt

	analog.map=	[HW,JOY] Analog joystick and gamepad support

			connected to one of 16 gameports
			Format: <type1>,<type2>,..<type16>

	apc=		[HW,SPARC]
			Power management functions (SPARCstation-4/5 + deriv.)
			Format: noidle
			Disable APC CPU standby support. SPARCstation-Fox does
			not play well with APC CPU idle - disable it if you have
			APC and your system crashes randomly.

	apic=		[APIC,X86-32] Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller
			Change the output verbosity whilst booting
			Format: { quiet (default) | verbose | debug }
			Change the amount of debugging information output
			when initialising the APIC and IO-APIC components.

	autoconf=	[IPV6]
			See Documentation/networking/ipv6.txt.

	show_lapic=	[APIC,X86] Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller
			Limit apic dumping. The parameter defines the maximal
			number of local apics being dumped. Also it is possible
			to set it to "all" by meaning -- no limit here.
			Format: { 1 (default) | 2 | ... | all }.
			The parameter valid if only apic=debug or
			apic=verbose is specified.
			Example: apic=debug show_lapic=all

	apm=		[APM] Advanced Power Management
			See header of arch/x86/kernel/apm_32.c.

	bttv.card=	[HW,V4L] bttv (bt848 + bt878 based grabber cards)
	bttv.radio=	Most important insmod options are available as
			kernel args too.
	bttv.pll=	See Documentation/video4linux/bttv/Insmod-options
	bttv.tuner=

	bulk_remove=off	[PPC]  This parameter disables the use of the pSeries
			firmware feature for flushing multiple hpte entries
			at a time.

	c101=		[NET] Moxa C101 synchronous serial card

	cachesize=	[BUGS=X86-32] Override level 2 CPU cache size detection.
			Sometimes CPU hardware bugs make them report the cache
			size incorrectly. The kernel will attempt work arounds
			to fix known problems, but for some CPUs it is not
			possible to determine what the correct size should be.
			This option provides an override for these situations.

	ccw_timeout_log [S390]
			See Documentation/s390/CommonIO for details.

	cgroup_disable= [KNL] Disable a particular controller
			Format: {name of the controller(s) to disable}
				{Currently supported controllers - "memory"}

	checkreqprot	[SELINUX] Set initial checkreqprot flag value.
			Format: { "0" | "1" }
			See security/selinux/Kconfig help text.
			0 -- check protection applied by kernel (includes
				any implied execute protection).
			1 -- check protection requested by application.
			Default value is set via a kernel config option.
			Value can be changed at runtime via
				/selinux/checkreqprot.

	cio_ignore=	[S390]
			See Documentation/s390/CommonIO for details.
	clk_ignore_unused
			[CLK]
			Keep all clocks already enabled by bootloader on,
			even if no driver has claimed them. This is useful
			for debug and development, but should not be
			needed on a platform with proper driver support.
			For more information, see Documentation/clk.txt.

	clock=		[BUGS=X86-32, HW] gettimeofday clocksource override.
			[Deprecated]
			Forces specified clocksource (if available) to be used
			when calculating gettimeofday(). If specified
			clocksource is not available, it defaults to PIT.

	clocksource=	Override the default clocksource
			Format: <string>
			Override the default clocksource and use the clocksource
			with the name specified.
			Some clocksource names to choose from, depending on
			the platform:
			[all] jiffies (this is the base, fallback clocksource)
			[ACPI] acpi_pm
			[ARM] imx_timer1,OSTS,netx_timer,mpu_timer2,
				pxa_timer,timer3,32k_counter,timer0_1

			[S390] tod
			[SH] SuperH
			[SPARC64] tick
			[X86-64] hpet,tsc

	clearcpuid=BITNUM [X86]
			Disable CPUID feature X for the kernel. See
			arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h for the valid bit
			numbers. Note the Linux specific bits are not necessarily
			stable over kernel options, but the vendor specific
			ones should be.
			Also note that user programs calling CPUID directly
			or using the feature without checking anything
			will still see it. This just prevents it from
			being used by the kernel or shown in /proc/cpuinfo.
			Also note the kernel might malfunction if you disable
			some critical bits.

	cma=nn[MG]	[ARM,KNL]
			Sets the size of kernel global memory area for contiguous
			memory allocations. For more information, see
			include/linux/dma-contiguous.h

	cmo_free_hint=	[PPC] Format: { yes | no }

			ARCnet - COM90xx chipset (memory-mapped buffers)
			Format: <io>[,<irq>[,<memstart>]]

	condev=		[HW,S390] console device
	conmode=

	console=	[KNL] Output console device and options.

		tty<n>	Use the virtual console device <n>.

		ttyS<n>[,options]
		ttyUSB0[,options]
			Use the specified serial port.  The options are of
			the form "bbbbpnf", where "bbbb" is the baud rate,
			"p" is parity ("n", "o", or "e"), "n" is number of
			bits, and "f" is flow control ("r" for RTS or
			omit it).  Default is "9600n8".

			See Documentation/serial-console.txt for more
			information.  See
			Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt for an
			alternative.

		uart[8250],io,<addr>[,options]
		uart[8250],mmio,<addr>[,options]
			Start an early, polled-mode console on the 8250/16550
			UART at the specified I/O port or MMIO address,
			switching to the matching ttyS device later.  The
			options are the same as for ttyS, above.
		hvc<n>	Use the hypervisor console device <n>. This is for
			both Xen and PowerPC hypervisors.

                If the device connected to the port is not a TTY but a braille
                device, prepend "brl," before the device type, for instance
			console=brl,ttyS0
		For now, only VisioBraille is supported.

	consoleblank=	[KNL] The console blank (screen saver) timeout in
			seconds. Defaults to 10*60 = 10mins. A value of 0
			disables the blank timer.

	coredump_filter=
			[KNL] Change the default value for
			/proc/<pid>/coredump_filter.
			See also Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt.

	cpuidle.off=1	[CPU_IDLE]
			disable the cpuidle sub-system

	cpcihp_generic=	[HW,PCI] Generic port I/O CompactPCI driver
			Format:
			<first_slot>,<last_slot>,<port>,<enum_bit>[,<debug>]

	crashkernel=size[KMG][@offset[KMG]]
			[KNL] Using kexec, Linux can switch to a 'crash kernel'
			upon panic. This parameter reserves the physical
			memory region [offset, offset + size] for that kernel
			image. If '@offset' is omitted, then a suitable offset
			is selected automatically. Check
			Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt for further details.

	crashkernel=range1:size1[,range2:size2,...][@offset]
			[KNL] Same as above, but depends on the memory
			in the running system. The syntax of range is
			start-[end] where start and end are both
			a memory unit (amount[KMG]). See also
			Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt for an example.

	crashkernel=size[KMG],high
			[KNL, x86_64] range could be above 4G. Allow kernel
			to allocate physical memory region from top, so could
			be above 4G if system have more than 4G ram installed.
			Otherwise memory region will be allocated below 4G, if
			available.
			It will be ignored if crashkernel=X is specified.
	crashkernel=size[KMG],low
			[KNL, x86_64] range under 4G. When crashkernel=X,high
			is passed, kernel could allocate physical memory region
			above 4G, that cause second kernel crash on system
			that require some amount of low memory, e.g. swiotlb
			requires at least 64M+32K low memory.  Kernel would
			try to allocate 72M below 4G automatically.
			This one let user to specify own low range under 4G
			for second kernel instead.
			0: to disable low allocation.
			It will be ignored when crashkernel=X,high is not used
			or memory reserved is below 4G.

	cs89x0_dma=	[HW,NET]
			Format: <dma>

	cs89x0_media=	[HW,NET]

			Format: <port#>,<type>
			See also Documentation/input/joystick-parport.txt

	ddebug_query=   [KNL,DYNAMIC_DEBUG] Enable debug messages at early boot
			time. See Documentation/dynamic-debug-howto.txt for
			details.  Deprecated, see dyndbg.

	debug		[KNL] Enable kernel debugging (events log level).

	debug_locks_verbose=
			[KNL] verbose self-tests
			Format=<0|1>
			Print debugging info while doing the locking API
			self-tests.
			We default to 0 (no extra messages), setting it to
			1 will print _a lot_ more information - normally
			only useful to kernel developers.

	debug_objects	[KNL] Enable object debugging

	no_debug_objects
			[KNL] Disable object debugging

	debug_guardpage_minorder=
			[KNL] When CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is set, this
			parameter allows control of the order of pages that will
			be intentionally kept free (and hence protected) by the
			buddy allocator. Bigger value increase the probability
			of catching random memory corruption, but reduce the
			amount of memory for normal system use. The maximum
			possible value is MAX_ORDER/2.  Setting this parameter
			to 1 or 2 should be enough to identify most random
			memory corruption problems caused by bugs in kernel or
			driver code when a CPU writes to (or reads from) a
			random memory location. Note that there exists a class
			of memory corruptions problems caused by buggy H/W or
			F/W or by drivers badly programing DMA (basically when
			memory is written at bus level and the CPU MMU is
			bypassed) which are not detectable by
			CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, hence this option will not help
			tracking down these problems.

	debugpat	[X86] Enable PAT debugging

	decnet.addr=	[HW,NET]
			Format: <area>[,<node>]
			See also Documentation/networking/decnet.txt.

	default_hugepagesz=
			[same as hugepagesz=] The size of the default
			HugeTLB page size. This is the size represented by
			the legacy /proc/ hugepages APIs, used for SHM, and
			default size when mounting hugetlbfs filesystems.
			Defaults to the default architecture's huge page size
			if not specified.

	dhash_entries=	[KNL]
			Set number of hash buckets for dentry cache.

	digi=		[HW,SERIAL]
			IO parameters + enable/disable command.

	digiepca=	[HW,SERIAL]
			See drivers/char/README.epca and
			Documentation/serial/digiepca.txt.

	disable=	[IPV6]
			See Documentation/networking/ipv6.txt.

	disable_ddw     [PPC/PSERIES]
			Disable Dynamic DMA Window support. Use this if
			to workaround buggy firmware.

	disable_ipv6=	[IPV6]
			See Documentation/networking/ipv6.txt.

	disable_mtrr_cleanup [X86]
			The kernel tries to adjust MTRR layout from continuous
			to discrete, to make X server driver able to add WB
			entry later. This parameter disables that.

	disable_mtrr_trim [X86, Intel and AMD only]
			By default the kernel will trim any uncacheable
			memory out of your available memory pool based on
			MTRR settings.  This parameter disables that behavior,
			possibly causing your machine to run very slowly.

	disable_timer_pin_1 [X86]
			Disable PIN 1 of APIC timer
			Can be useful to work around chipset bugs.

	dma_debug=off	If the kernel is compiled with DMA_API_DEBUG support,
			this option disables the debugging code at boot.

	dma_debug_entries=<number>
			This option allows to tune the number of preallocated
			entries for DMA-API debugging code. One entry is
			required per DMA-API allocation. Use this if the
			DMA-API debugging code disables itself because the
			architectural default is too low.

	dma_debug_driver=<driver_name>
			With this option the DMA-API debugging driver
			filter feature can be enabled at boot time. Just
			pass the driver to filter for as the parameter.
			The filter can be disabled or changed to another
			driver later using sysfs.

	drm_kms_helper.edid_firmware=[<connector>:]<file>
			Broken monitors, graphic adapters and KVMs may
			send no or incorrect EDID data sets. This parameter
			allows to specify an EDID data set in the
			/lib/firmware directory that is used instead.
			Generic built-in EDID data sets are used, if one of
			edid/1024x768.bin, edid/1280x1024.bin,
			edid/1680x1050.bin, or edid/1920x1080.bin is given
			and no file with the same name exists. Details and
			instructions how to build your own EDID data are
			available in Documentation/EDID/HOWTO.txt. An EDID
			data set will only be used for a particular connector,
			if its name and a colon are prepended to the EDID
			name.

	dscc4.setup=	[NET]

	dyndbg[="val"]		[KNL,DYNAMIC_DEBUG]
	module.dyndbg[="val"]
			Enable debug messages at boot time.  See
			Documentation/dynamic-debug-howto.txt for details.

	earlycon=	[KNL] Output early console device and options.
		uart[8250],io,<addr>[,options]
		uart[8250],mmio,<addr>[,options]
		uart[8250],mmio32,<addr>[,options]
			Start an early, polled-mode console on the 8250/16550
			UART at the specified I/O port or MMIO address.
			MMIO inter-register address stride is either 8-bit
			(mmio) or 32-bit (mmio32).
			The options are the same as for ttyS, above.

	earlyprintk=	[X86,SH,BLACKFIN,ARM]
			earlyprintk=vga
			earlyprintk=xen
			earlyprintk=serial[,ttySn[,baudrate]]
			earlyprintk=serial[,0x...[,baudrate]]
			earlyprintk=ttySn[,baudrate]
			earlyprintk=dbgp[debugController#]

			earlyprintk is useful when the kernel crashes before
			the normal console is initialized. It is not enabled by
			default because it has some cosmetic problems.

			Append ",keep" to not disable it when the real console
			takes over.

			Only vga or serial or usb debug port at a time.

			Currently only ttyS0 and ttyS1 may be specified by
			name.  Other I/O ports may be explicitly specified
			on some architectures (x86 and arm at least) by
			replacing ttySn with an I/O port address, like this:
				earlyprintk=serial,0x1008,115200
			You can find the port for a given device in
			/proc/tty/driver/serial:
				2: uart:ST16650V2 port:00001008 irq:18 ...

			Interaction with the standard serial driver is not
			very good.

			The VGA output is eventually overwritten by the real
			console.

			The xen output can only be used by Xen PV guests.

	ekgdboc=	[X86,KGDB] Allow early kernel console debugging
			ekgdboc=kbd

			This is designed to be used in conjunction with
			the boot argument: earlyprintk=vga

			to discrete, to make X server driver able to add WB
			entry later. This parameter enables that.

	enable_timer_pin_1 [X86]
			Enable PIN 1 of APIC timer
			Can be useful to work around chipset bugs
			(in particular on some ATI chipsets).
			The kernel tries to set a reasonable default.

			See Documentation/blockdev/floppy.txt.

	force_pal_cache_flush
			[IA-64] Avoid check_sal_cache_flush which may hang on
			buggy SAL_CACHE_FLUSH implementations. Using this
			parameter will force ia64_sal_cache_flush to call
			ia64_pal_cache_flush instead of SAL_CACHE_FLUSH.

	ftrace=[tracer]
			[FTRACE] will set and start the specified tracer
			as early as possible in order to facilitate early
			boot debugging.

	ftrace_dump_on_oops[=orig_cpu]
			[FTRACE] will dump the trace buffers on oops.

			buffers of all CPUs, but if you pass orig_cpu, it will
			dump only the buffer of the CPU that triggered the
			oops.

	ftrace_filter=[function-list]
			[FTRACE] Limit the functions traced by the function
			tracer at boot up. function-list is a comma separated
			list of functions. This list can be changed at run
			time by the set_ftrace_filter file in the debugfs
			tracing directory.

	ftrace_notrace=[function-list]
			[FTRACE] Do not trace the functions specified in
			function-list. This list can be changed at run time
			by the set_ftrace_notrace file in the debugfs
			tracing directory.

	ftrace_graph_filter=[function-list]
			[FTRACE] Limit the top level callers functions traced
			by the function graph tracer at boot up.
			function-list is a comma separated list of functions

			between unregistering the boot console and initializing
			the real console.

	i2c_bus=	[HW] Override the default board specific I2C bus speed
			     or register an additional I2C bus that is not

			capability is set.

	i915.invert_brightness=
			[DRM] Invert the sense of the variable that is used to
			set the brightness of the panel backlight. Normally a
			brightness value of 0 indicates backlight switched off,
			and the maximum of the brightness value sets the backlight
			to maximum brightness. If this parameter is set to 0
			(default) and the machine requires it, or this parameter
			is set to 1, a brightness value of 0 sets the backlight
			to maximum brightness, and the maximum of the brightness

	idle=		[X86]
			Format: idle=poll, idle=halt, idle=nomwait
			Poll forces a polling idle loop that can slightly
			improve the performance of waking up a idle CPU, but
			will use a lot of power and make the system run hot.
			Not recommended.
			idle=halt: Halt is forced to be used for CPU idle.
			In such case C2/C3 won't be used again.
			idle=nomwait: Disable mwait for CPU C-states

	ignore_loglevel	[KNL]
			Ignore loglevel setting - this will print /all/
			kernel messages to the console. Useful for debugging.

			/sys/module/printk/parameters/ignore_loglevel.

	ihash_entries=	[KNL]
			Set number of hash buckets for inode cache.

	ima_appraise=	[IMA] appraise integrity measurements

	intel_iommu=	[DMAR] Intel IOMMU driver (DMAR) option
		on
			Enable intel iommu driver.
		off
			Disable intel iommu driver.
		igfx_off [Default Off]
			By default, gfx is mapped as normal device. If a gfx
			device has a dedicated DMAR unit, the DMAR unit is
			bypassed by not enabling DMAR with this option. In
			this case, gfx device will use physical address for
			DMA.
		forcedac [x86_64]
			With this option iommu will not optimize to look
			for io virtual address below 32-bit forcing dual
			address cycle on pci bus for cards supporting greater
			than 32-bit addressing. The default is to look
			for translation below 32-bit and if not available
			then look in the higher range.
		strict [Default Off]
			With this option on every unmap_single operation will
			result in a hardware IOTLB flush operation as opposed
			to batching them for performance.
		sp_off [Default Off]

	irqfixup	[HW]
			When an interrupt is not handled search all handlers
			for it. Intended to get systems with badly broken
			firmware running.

	isapnp=		[ISAPNP]
			Format: <RDP>,<reset>,<pci_scan>,<verbosity>

	isolcpus=	[KNL,SMP] Isolate CPUs from the general scheduler.
			Format:
			<cpu number>,...,<cpu number>
			or
			<cpu number>-<cpu number>
			(must be a positive range in ascending order)
			or a mixture
			<cpu number>,...,<cpu number>-<cpu number>

			This option can be used to specify one or more CPUs
			to isolate from the general SMP balancing and scheduling
			algorithms. You can move a process onto or off an
			"isolated" CPU via the CPU affinity syscalls or cpuset.
			<cpu number> begins at 0 and the maximum value is
			"number of CPUs in system - 1".

			This option is the preferred way to isolate CPUs. The
			alternative -- manually setting the CPU mask of all
			tasks in the system -- can cause problems and
			suboptimal load balancer performance.

	iucv=		[HW,NET]

	ivrs_ioapic	[HW,X86_64]
			Provide an override to the IOAPIC-ID<->DEVICE-ID
			mapping provided in the IVRS ACPI table. For

	keepinitrd	[HW,ARM]

	kernelcore=nn[KMG]	[KNL,X86,IA-64,PPC] This parameter
			specifies the amount of memory usable by the kernel
			for non-movable allocations.  The requested amount is
			spread evenly throughout all nodes in the system. The
			remaining memory in each node is used for Movable
			pages. In the event, a node is too small to have both
			kernelcore and Movable pages, kernelcore pages will
			take priority and other nodes will have a larger number
			of kernelcore pages.  The Movable zone is used for the
			allocation of pages that may be reclaimed or moved
			by the page migration subsystem.  This means that
			HugeTLB pages may not be allocated from this zone.
			Note that allocations like PTEs-from-HighMem still
			use the HighMem zone if it exists, and the Normal
			zone if it does not.

	kgdbdbgp=	[KGDB,HW] kgdb over EHCI usb debug port.
			Format: <Controller#>[,poll interval]
			The controller # is the number of the ehci usb debug
			port as it is probed via PCI.  The poll interval is
			optional and is the number seconds in between
			each poll cycle to the debug port in case you need
			the functionality for interrupting the kernel with
			gdb or control-c on the dbgp connection.  When
			not using this parameter you use sysrq-g to break into
			the kernel debugger.

	kgdboc=		[KGDB,HW] kgdb over consoles.

			KVM MMU at runtime.
			Default is 0 (off)

	kvm-amd.nested=	[KVM,AMD] Allow nested virtualization in KVM/SVM.
			Default is 1 (enabled)

	lapic		[X86-32,APIC] Enable the local APIC even if BIOS
			disabled it.

	lapic=		[x86,APIC] "notscdeadline" Do not use TSC deadline
			value for LAPIC timer one-shot implementation. Default
			back to the programmable timer unit in the LAPIC.

			in C2 power state.

	libata.dma=	[LIBATA] DMA control
			libata.dma=0	  Disable all PATA and SATA DMA
			libata.dma=1	  PATA and SATA Disk DMA only
			libata.dma=2	  ATAPI (CDROM) DMA only
			libata.dma=4	  Compact Flash DMA only
			Combinations also work, so libata.dma=3 enables DMA
			for disks and CDROMs, but not CFs.

	libata.ignore_hpa=	[LIBATA] Ignore HPA limit

			libata.ignore_hpa=1	  ignore limits, using full disk

	libata.noacpi	[LIBATA] Disables use of ACPI in libata suspend/resume
			when set.
			Format: <int>

	libata.force=	[LIBATA] Force configurations.  The format is comma
			separated list of "[ID:]VAL" where ID is
			PORT[.DEVICE].  PORT and DEVICE are decimal numbers
			matching port, link or device.  Basically, it matches
			the ATA ID string printed on console by libata.  If
			the whole ID part is omitted, the last PORT and DEVICE
			values are used.  If ID hasn't been specified yet, the
			configuration applies to all ports, links and devices.

			If only DEVICE is omitted, the parameter applies to
			the port and all links and devices behind it.  DEVICE
			number of 0 either selects the first device or the
			first fan-out link behind PMP device.  It does not
			select the host link.  DEVICE number of 15 selects the
			host link and device attached to it.

			The VAL specifies the configuration to force.  As long
			as there's no ambiguity shortcut notation is allowed.
			For example, both 1.5 and 1.5G would work for 1.5Gbps.
			The following configurations can be forced.

			* Cable type: 40c, 80c, short40c, unk, ign or sata.
			  Any ID with matching PORT is used.

			* SATA link speed limit: 1.5Gbps or 3.0Gbps.

			* Transfer mode: pio[0-7], mwdma[0-4] and udma[0-7].
			  udma[/][16,25,33,44,66,100,133] notation is also
			  allowed.

			* [no]ncq: Turn on or off NCQ.

			* nohrst, nosrst, norst: suppress hard, soft
                          and both resets.

			* rstonce: only attempt one reset during
			  hot-unplug link recovery

			* dump_id: dump IDENTIFY data.

			* atapi_dmadir: Enable ATAPI DMADIR bridge support

			If there are multiple matching configurations changing
			the same attribute, the last one is used.

	memblock=debug	[KNL] Enable memblock debug messages.

	load_ramdisk=	[RAM] List of ramdisks to load from floppy
			See Documentation/blockdev/ramdisk.txt.

	lockd.nlm_grace_period=P  [NFS] Assign grace period.
			Format: <integer>

	lockd.nlm_tcpport=N	[NFS] Assign TCP port.
			Format: <integer>

	lockd.nlm_timeout=T	[NFS] Assign timeout value.
			Format: <integer>

	lockd.nlm_udpport=M	[NFS] Assign UDP port.
			Format: <integer>

	logibm.irq=	[HW,MOUSE] Logitech Bus Mouse Driver
			Format: <irq>

	loglevel=	All Kernel Messages with a loglevel smaller than the
			console loglevel will be printed to the console. It can
			also be changed with klogd or other programs. The
			loglevels are defined as follows:

			0 (KERN_EMERG)		system is unusable
			1 (KERN_ALERT)		action must be taken immediately
			2 (KERN_CRIT)		critical conditions
			3 (KERN_ERR)		error conditions
			4 (KERN_WARNING)	warning conditions
			5 (KERN_NOTICE)		normal but significant condition
			6 (KERN_INFO)		informational
			7 (KERN_DEBUG)		debug-level messages

	log_buf_len=n[KMG]	Sets the size of the printk ring buffer,
			in bytes.  n must be a power of two.  The default
			size is set in the kernel config file.

	logo.nologo	[FB] Disables display of the built-in Linux logo.
			This may be used to provide more screen space for
			kernel log messages and is useful when debugging
			kernel boot problems.

	lp=0		[LP]	Specify parallel ports to use, e.g,
	lp=port[,port...]	lp=none,parport0 (lp0 not configured, lp1 uses
	lp=reset		first parallel port). 'lp=0' disables the
	lp=auto			printer driver. 'lp=reset' (which can be
				specified in addition to the ports) causes
				attached printers to be reset. Using
				lp=port1,port2,... specifies the parallel ports
				to associate lp devices with, starting with
				lp0. A port specification may be 'none' to skip
				that lp device, or a parport name such as
				'parport0'. Specifying 'lp=auto' instead of a
				port specification list means that device IDs
				from each port should be examined, to see if
				an IEEE 1284-compliant printer is attached; if
				so, the driver will manage that printer.
				See also header of drivers/char/lp.c.

	lpj=n		[KNL]
			Sets loops_per_jiffy to given constant, thus avoiding
			time-consuming boot-time autodetection (up to 250 ms per
			CPU). 0 enables autodetection (default). To determine
			the correct value for your kernel, boot with normal
			autodetection and see what value is printed. Note that
			on SMP systems the preset will be applied to all CPUs,
			which is likely to cause problems if your CPUs need
			significantly divergent settings. An incorrect value
			will cause delays in the kernel to be wrong, leading to
			unpredictable I/O errors and other breakage. Although
			unlikely, in the extreme case this might damage your
			hardware.

	ltpc=		[NET]
			Format: <io>,<irq>,<dma>

	machvec=	[IA-64] Force the use of a particular machine-vector
			(machvec) in a generic kernel.

	machtype=	[Loongson] Share the same kernel image file between different
			 yeeloong laptop.
			Example: machtype=lemote-yeeloong-2f-7inch

	max_addr=nn[KMG]	[KNL,BOOT,ia64] All physical memory greater
			than or equal to this physical address is ignored.

	maxcpus=	[SMP] Maximum number of processors that	an SMP kernel
			should make use of.  maxcpus=n : n >= 0 limits the
			kernel to using 'n' processors.  n=0 is a special case,
			it is equivalent to "nosmp", which also disables
			the IO APIC.

	max_loop=	[LOOP] The number of loop block devices that get
	(loop.max_loop)	unconditionally pre-created at init time. The default
			number is configured by BLK_DEV_LOOP_MIN_COUNT. Instead
			of statically allocating a predefined number, loop
			devices can be requested on-demand with the
			/dev/loop-control interface.

	mce		[X86-32] Machine Check Exception

	mce=option	[X86-64] See Documentation/x86/x86_64/boot-options.txt

	mem=nn[KMG]	[KNL,BOOT] Force usage of a specific amount of memory
			Amount of memory to be used when the kernel is not able
			to see the whole system memory or for test.
			[X86] Work as limiting max address. Use together
			with memmap= to avoid physical address space collisions.
			Without memmap= PCI devices could be placed at addresses
			belonging to unused RAM.

	mem=nopentium	[BUGS=X86-32] Disable usage of 4MB pages for kernel
			memory.

	memchunk=nn[KMG]
			[KNL,SH] Allow user to override the default size for
			per-device physically contiguous DMA buffers.

	memmap=exactmap	[KNL,X86] Enable setting of an exact
			E820 memory map, as specified by the user.
			Such memmap=exactmap lines can be constructed based on
			BIOS output or other requirements. See the memmap=nn@ss
			option description.

	memmap=nn[KMG]@ss[KMG]
			[KNL] Force usage of a specific region of memory
			Region of memory to be used, from ss to ss+nn.

	memmap=nn[KMG]#ss[KMG]
			[KNL,ACPI] Mark specific memory as ACPI data.
			Region of memory to be used, from ss to ss+nn.

	memmap=nn[KMG]$ss[KMG]
			[KNL,ACPI] Mark specific memory as reserved.
			Region of memory to be used, from ss to ss+nn.
			Example: Exclude memory from 0x18690000-0x1869ffff
			         memmap=64K$0x18690000
			         or
			         memmap=0x10000$0x18690000

	memory_corruption_check=0/1 [X86]
			Some BIOSes seem to corrupt the first 64k of
			memory when doing things like suspend/resume.
			Setting this option will scan the memory
			looking for corruption.  Enabling this will
			both detect corruption and prevent the kernel
			from using the memory being corrupted.
			However, its intended as a diagnostic tool; if
			repeatable BIOS-originated corruption always
			affects the same memory, you can use memmap=
			to prevent the kernel from using that memory.

	memory_corruption_check_size=size [X86]
			By default it checks for corruption in the low
			64k, making this memory unavailable for normal
			use.  Use this parameter to scan for
			corruption in more or less memory.

	memory_corruption_check_period=seconds [X86]
			By default it checks for corruption every 60
			seconds.  Use this parameter to check at some
			other rate.  0 disables periodic checking.

	memtest=	[KNL,X86] Enable memtest
			Format: <integer>
			default : 0 <disable>
			Specifies the number of memtest passes to be
			performed. Each pass selects another test
			pattern from a given set of patterns. Memtest
			fills the memory with this pattern, validates
			memory contents and reserves bad memory
			regions that are detected.

	meye.*=		[HW] Set MotionEye Camera parameters
			See Documentation/video4linux/meye.txt.

	mfgpt_irq=	[IA-32] Specify the IRQ to use for the
			Multi-Function General Purpose Timers on AMD Geode
			platforms.

	mfgptfix	[X86-32] Fix MFGPT timers on AMD Geode platforms when
			the BIOS has incorrectly applied a workaround. TinyBIOS
			version 0.98 is known to be affected, 0.99 fixes the
			problem by letting the user disable the workaround.

	mga=		[HW,DRM]

	min_addr=nn[KMG]	[KNL,BOOT,ia64] All physical memory below this
			physical address is ignored.

	mini2440=	[ARM,HW,KNL]
			Format:[0..2][b][c][t]
			Default: "0tb"
			MINI2440 configuration specification:
			0 - The attached screen is the 3.5" TFT
			1 - The attached screen is the 7" TFT
			2 - The VGA Shield is attached (1024x768)
			Leaving out the screen size parameter will not load
			the TFT driver, and the framebuffer will be left
			unconfigured.
			b - Enable backlight. The TFT backlight pin will be
			linked to the kernel VESA blanking code and a GPIO
			LED. This parameter is not necessary when using the
			VGA shield.
			c - Enable the s3c camera interface.
			t - Reserved for enabling touchscreen support. The
			touchscreen support is not enabled in the mainstream
			kernel as of 2.6.30, a preliminary port can be found
			in the "bleeding edge" mini2440 support kernel at
			http://repo.or.cz/w/linux-2.6/mini2440.git

	mminit_loglevel=
			[KNL] When CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMORY_INIT is set, this
			parameter allows control of the logging verbosity for
			the additional memory initialisation checks. A value
			of 0 disables mminit logging and a level of 4 will
			log everything. Information is printed at KERN_DEBUG
			so loglevel=8 may also need to be specified.

	module.sig_enforce
			[KNL] When CONFIG_MODULE_SIG is set, this means that
			modules without (valid) signatures will fail to load.
			Note that if CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE is set, that
			is always true, so this option does nothing.

	mousedev.tap_time=
			[MOUSE] Maximum time between finger touching and
			leaving touchpad surface for touch to be considered
			a tap and be reported as a left button click (for
			touchpads working in absolute mode only).
			Format: <msecs>
	mousedev.xres=	[MOUSE] Horizontal screen resolution, used for devices
			reporting absolute coordinates, such as tablets
	mousedev.yres=	[MOUSE] Vertical screen resolution, used for devices
			reporting absolute coordinates, such as tablets

	movablecore=nn[KMG]	[KNL,X86,IA-64,PPC] This parameter
			is similar to kernelcore except it specifies the
			amount of memory used for migratable allocations.
			If both kernelcore and movablecore is specified,
			then kernelcore will be at *least* the specified
			value but may be more. If movablecore on its own
			is specified, the administrator must be careful
			that the amount of memory usable for all allocations
			is not too small.

	MTD_Partition=	[MTD]
			Format: <name>,<region-number>,<size>,<offset>

	MTD_Region=	[MTD] Format:
			<name>,<region-number>[,<base>,<size>,<buswidth>,<altbuswidth>]

	mtdparts=	[MTD]
			See drivers/mtd/cmdlinepart.c.

	multitce=off	[PPC]  This parameter disables the use of the pSeries
			firmware feature for updating multiple TCE entries
			at a time.

	onenand.bdry=	[HW,MTD] Flex-OneNAND Boundary Configuration

			Format: [die0_boundary][,die0_lock][,die1_boundary][,die1_lock]

			boundary - index of last SLC block on Flex-OneNAND.
				   The remaining blocks are configured as MLC blocks.
			lock	 - Configure if Flex-OneNAND boundary should be locked.
				   Once locked, the boundary cannot be changed.
				   1 indicates lock status, 0 indicates unlock status.

	mtdset=		[ARM]
			ARM/S3C2412 JIVE boot control

			See arch/arm/mach-s3c2412/mach-jive.c

	mtouchusb.raw_coordinates=
			[HW] Make the MicroTouch USB driver use raw coordinates
			('y', default) or cooked coordinates ('n')

	mtrr_chunk_size=nn[KMG] [X86]
			used for mtrr cleanup. It is largest continuous chunk
			that could hold holes aka. UC entries.

	mtrr_gran_size=nn[KMG] [X86]
			Used for mtrr cleanup. It is granularity of mtrr block.
			Default is 1.
			Large value could prevent small alignment from
			using up MTRRs.

	mtrr_spare_reg_nr=n [X86]
			Format: <integer>
			Range: 0,7 : spare reg number
			Default : 1
			Used for mtrr cleanup. It is spare mtrr entries number.
			Set to 2 or more if your graphical card needs more.

	n2=		[NET] SDL Inc. RISCom/N2 synchronous serial card

	netdev=		[NET] Network devices parameters
			Format: <irq>,<io>,<mem_start>,<mem_end>,<name>
			Note that mem_start is often overloaded to mean
			something different and driver-specific.
			This usage is only documented in each driver source
			file if at all.

	nf_conntrack.acct=
			[NETFILTER] Enable connection tracking flow accounting
			0 to disable accounting
			1 to enable accounting
			Default value is 0.

	nfsaddrs=	[NFS] Deprecated.  Use ip= instead.
			See Documentation/filesystems/nfs/nfsroot.txt.

	nfsroot=	[NFS] nfs root filesystem for disk-less boxes.
			See Documentation/filesystems/nfs/nfsroot.txt.

	nfsrootdebug	[NFS] enable nfsroot debugging messages.
			See Documentation/filesystems/nfs/nfsroot.txt.

	nfs.callback_tcpport=
			[NFS] set the TCP port on which the NFSv4 callback
			channel should listen.

	nfs.cache_getent=
			[NFS] sets the pathname to the program which is used
			to update the NFS client cache entries.

	nfs.cache_getent_timeout=
			[NFS] sets the timeout after which an attempt to
			update a cache entry is deemed to have failed.

	nfs.idmap_cache_timeout=
			[NFS] set the maximum lifetime for idmapper cache
			entries.

	nfs.enable_ino64=
			[NFS] enable 64-bit inode numbers.
			If zero, the NFS client will fake up a 32-bit inode
			number for the readdir() and stat() syscalls instead
			of returning the full 64-bit number.
			The default is to return 64-bit inode numbers.

	nfs.max_session_slots=
			[NFSv4.1] Sets the maximum number of session slots
			the client will attempt to negotiate with the server.
			This limits the number of simultaneous RPC requests
			that the client can send to the NFSv4.1 server.
			Note that there is little point in setting this
			value higher than the max_tcp_slot_table_limit.

	nfs.nfs4_disable_idmapping=
			[NFSv4] When set to the default of '1', this option
			ensures that both the RPC level authentication
			scheme and the NFS level operations agree to use
			numeric uids/gids if the mount is using the
			'sec=sys' security flavour. In effect it is
			disabling idmapping, which can make migration from
			legacy NFSv2/v3 systems to NFSv4 easier.
			Servers that do not support this mode of operation
			will be autodetected by the client, and it will fall
			back to using the idmapper.
			To turn off this behaviour, set the value to '0'.
	nfs.nfs4_unique_id=
			[NFS4] Specify an additional fixed unique ident-
			ification string that NFSv4 clients can insert into
			their nfs_client_id4 string.  This is typically a
			UUID that is generated at system install time.

	nfs.send_implementation_id =
			[NFSv4.1] Send client implementation identification
			information in exchange_id requests.
			If zero, no implementation identification information
			will be sent.
			The default is to send the implementation identification
			information.

	nfsd.nfs4_disable_idmapping=
			[NFSv4] When set to the default of '1', the NFSv4
			server will return only numeric uids and gids to
			clients using auth_sys, and will accept numeric uids
			and gids from such clients.  This is intended to ease
			migration from NFSv2/v3.

	objlayoutdriver.osd_login_prog=
			[NFS] [OBJLAYOUT] sets the pathname to the program which
			is used to automatically discover and login into new
			osd-targets. Please see:
			Documentation/filesystems/pnfs.txt for more explanations

	nmi_debug=	[KNL,AVR32,SH] Specify one or more actions to take
			when a NMI is triggered.
			Format: [state][,regs][,debounce][,die]

	nmi_watchdog=	[KNL,BUGS=X86] Debugging features for SMP kernels
			Format: [panic,][nopanic,][num]
			Valid num: 0
			0 - turn nmi_watchdog off
			When panic is specified, panic when an NMI watchdog
			timeout occurs (or 'nopanic' to override the opposite
			default).
			This is useful when you use a panic=... timeout and
			need the box quickly up again.

	netpoll.carrier_timeout=
			[NET] Specifies amount of time (in seconds) that
			netpoll should wait for a carrier. By default netpoll
			waits 4 seconds.

	no387		[BUGS=X86-32] Tells the kernel to use the 387 maths
			emulation library even if a 387 maths coprocessor
			is present.

	no_console_suspend
			[HW] Never suspend the console
			Disable suspending of consoles during suspend and
			hibernate operations.  Once disabled, debugging
			messages can reach various consoles while the rest
			of the system is being put to sleep (ie, while
			debugging driver suspend/resume hooks).  This may
			not work reliably with all consoles, but is known
			to work with serial and VGA consoles.
			To facilitate more flexible debugging, we also add
			console_suspend, a printk module parameter to control
			it. Users could use console_suspend (usually
			/sys/module/printk/parameters/console_suspend) to
			turn on/off it dynamically.

	noaliencache	[MM, NUMA, SLAB] Disables the allocation of alien
			caches in the slab allocator.  Saves per-node memory,
			but will impact performance.

	noalign		[KNL,ARM]

			noexec=off: disable non-executable mappings

	nosmap		[X86]
			Disable SMAP (Supervisor Mode Access Prevention)
			even if it is supported by processor.

	nosmep		[X86]
			Disable SMEP (Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention)
			even if it is supported by processor.

	noexec32	[X86-64]
			This affects only 32-bit executables.
			noexec32=on: enable non-executable mappings (default)
				read doesn't imply executable mappings
			noexec32=off: disable non-executable mappings
				read implies executable mappings

	nofpu		[SH] Disable hardware FPU at boot time.

	nofxsr		[BUGS=X86-32] Disables x86 floating point extended
			register save and restore. The kernel will only save
			legacy floating-point registers on task switch.

	noxsave		[BUGS=X86] Disables x86 extended register state save
			and restore using xsave. The kernel will fallback to
			enabling legacy floating-point and sse state.

	eagerfpu=	[X86]
			on	enable eager fpu restore
			off	disable eager fpu restore
			auto	selects the default scheme, which automatically
				enables eagerfpu restore for xsaveopt.

	nohlt		[BUGS=ARM,SH] Tells the kernel that the sleep(SH) or
			wfi(ARM) instruction doesn't work correctly and not to
			use it. This is also useful when using JTAG debugger.

	no_file_caps	Tells the kernel not to honor file capabilities.  The
			only way then for a file to be executed with privilege
			is to be setuid root or executed by root.

	nohalt		[IA-64] Tells the kernel not to use the power saving
			function PAL_HALT_LIGHT when idle. This increases
			power-consumption. On the positive side, it reduces
			interrupt wake-up latency, which may improve performance
			in certain environments such as networked servers or
			real-time systems.

	nohz=		[KNL] Boottime enable/disable dynamic ticks
			Valid arguments: on, off
			Default: on

	nohz_full=	[KNL,BOOT]
			In kernels built with CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL=y, set
			the specified list of CPUs whose tick will be stopped
			whenever possible. The boot CPU will be forced outside
			the range to maintain the timekeeping.
			The CPUs in this range must also be included in the
			rcu_nocbs= set.

	noiotrap	[SH] Disables trapped I/O port accesses.

	cpu0_hotplug	[X86] Turn on CPU0 hotplug feature when
			CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HOTPLUG_CPU0 is off.
			Some features depend on CPU0. Known dependencies are:
			1. Resume from suspend/hibernate depends on CPU0.
			Suspend/hibernate will fail if CPU0 is offline and you
			need to online CPU0 before suspend/hibernate.
			2. PIC interrupts also depend on CPU0. CPU0 can't be
			removed if a PIC interrupt is detected.
			It's said poweroff/reboot may depend on CPU0 on some
			machines although I haven't seen such issues so far
			after CPU0 is offline on a few tested machines.
			If the dependencies are under your control, you can
			turn on cpu0_hotplug.

	nptcg=		[IA-64] Override max number of concurrent global TLB
			purges which is reported from either PAL_VM_SUMMARY or
			SAL PALO.

	nr_cpus=	[SMP] Maximum number of processors that	an SMP kernel
			could support.  nr_cpus=n : n >= 1 limits the kernel to

			Rather than timing out after 20 ms if an EC
			command is not properly ACKed, override the length
			of the timeout.  We have interrupts disabled while
			waiting for the ACK, so if this is set too high
			interrupts *may* be lost!

	omap_mux=	[OMAP] Override bootloader pin multiplexing.
			Format: <mux_mode0.mode_name=value>...
			For example, to override I2C bus2:

			Format: <mode>

	parport=	[HW,PPT] Specify parallel ports. 0 disables.
			Format: { 0 | auto | 0xBBB[,IRQ[,DMA]] }
			Use 'auto' to force the driver to use any
			IRQ/DMA settings detected (the default is to
			ignore detected IRQ/DMA settings because of
			possible conflicts). You can specify the base
			address, IRQ, and DMA settings; IRQ and DMA
			should be numbers, or 'auto' (for using detected
			settings on that particular port), or 'nofifo'
			(to avoid using a FIFO even if it is detected).
			Parallel ports are assigned in the order they
			are specified on the command line, starting
			with parport0.

	parport_init_mode=	[HW,PPT]
			Configure VIA parallel port to operate in
			a specific mode. This is necessary on Pegasos
			computer where firmware has no options for setting
			up parallel port mode and sets it to spp.
			Currently this function knows 686a and 8231 chips.
			Format: [spp|ps2|epp|ecp|ecpepp]

	pause_on_oops=
			Halt all CPUs after the first oops has been printed for

		earlydump	[X86] dump PCI config space before the kernel
			        changes anything
		off		[X86] don't probe for the PCI bus
		bios		[X86-32] force use of PCI BIOS, don't access
				the hardware directly. Use this if your machine
				has a non-standard PCI host bridge.
		nobios		[X86-32] disallow use of PCI BIOS, only direct
				hardware access methods are allowed. Use this
				if you experience crashes upon bootup and you
				suspect they are caused by the BIOS.
		conf1		[X86] Force use of PCI Configuration
				Mechanism 1.
		conf2		[X86] Force use of PCI Configuration
				Mechanism 2.
		noaer		[PCIE] If the PCIEAER kernel config parameter is
				enabled, this kernel boot option can be used to
				disable the use of PCIE advanced error reporting.
		nodomains	[PCI] Disable support for multiple PCI
				root domains (aka PCI segments, in ACPI-speak).
		nommconf	[X86] Disable use of MMCONFIG for PCI
				Configuration
		check_enable_amd_mmconf [X86] check for and enable
				properly configured MMIO access to PCI
				config space on AMD family 10h CPU
		nomsi		[MSI] If the PCI_MSI kernel config parameter is
				enabled, this kernel boot option can be used to
				disable the use of MSI interrupts system-wide.
		noioapicquirk	[APIC] Disable all boot interrupt quirks.
				Safety option to keep boot IRQs enabled. This
				should never be necessary.
		ioapicreroute	[APIC] Enable rerouting of boot IRQs to the
				primary IO-APIC for bridges that cannot disable
				boot IRQs. This fixes a source of spurious IRQs
				when the system masks IRQs.
		noioapicreroute	[APIC] Disable workaround that uses the
				boot IRQ equivalent of an IRQ that connects to
				a chipset where boot IRQs cannot be disabled.
				The opposite of ioapicreroute.
		biosirq		[X86-32] Use PCI BIOS calls to get the interrupt
				routing table. These calls are known to be buggy
				on several machines and they hang the machine
				when used, but on other computers it's the only
				way to get the interrupt routing table. Try
				this option if the kernel is unable to allocate
				IRQs or discover secondary PCI buses on your
				motherboard.
		rom		[X86] Assign address space to expansion ROMs.
				Use with caution as certain devices share
				address decoders between ROMs and other
				resources.
		norom		[X86] Do not assign address space to
				expansion ROMs that do not already have
				BIOS assigned address ranges.
		nobar		[X86] Do not assign address space to the
				BARs that weren't assigned by the BIOS.
		irqmask=0xMMMM	[X86] Set a bit mask of IRQs allowed to be
				assigned automatically to PCI devices. You can
				make the kernel exclude IRQs of your ISA cards
				this way.
		pirqaddr=0xAAAAA	[X86] Specify the physical address
				of the PIRQ table (normally generated
				by the BIOS) if it is outside the
				F0000h-100000h range.
		lastbus=N	[X86] Scan all buses thru bus #N. Can be
				useful if the kernel is unable to find your
				secondary buses and you want to tell it
				explicitly which ones they are.
		assign-busses	[X86] Always assign all PCI bus
				numbers ourselves, overriding
				whatever the firmware may have done.
		usepirqmask	[X86] Honor the possible IRQ mask stored
				in the BIOS $PIR table. This is needed on
				some systems with broken BIOSes, notably
				some HP Pavilion N5400 and Omnibook XE3
				notebooks. This will have no effect if ACPI
				IRQ routing is enabled.
		noacpi		[X86] Do not use ACPI for IRQ routing
				or for PCI scanning.
		use_crs		[X86] Use PCI host bridge window information
				from ACPI.  On BIOSes from 2008 or later, this
				is enabled by default.  If you need to use this,
				please report a bug.
		nocrs		[X86] Ignore PCI host bridge windows from ACPI.
			        If you need to use this, please report a bug.
		routeirq	Do IRQ routing for all PCI devices.
				This is normally done in pci_enable_device(),
				so this option is a temporary workaround
				for broken drivers that don't call it.
		skip_isa_align	[X86] do not align io start addr, so can
				handle more pci cards
		firmware	[ARM] Do not re-enumerate the bus but instead
				just use the configuration from the
				bootloader. This is currently used on
				IXP2000 systems where the bus has to be
				configured a certain way for adjunct CPUs.
		noearly		[X86] Don't do any early type 1 scanning.
				This might help on some broken boards which
				machine check when some devices' config space
				is read. But various workarounds are disabled
				and some IOMMU drivers will not work.
		bfsort		Sort PCI devices into breadth-first order.
				This sorting is done to get a device
				order compatible with older (<= 2.4) kernels.
		nobfsort	Don't sort PCI devices into breadth-first order.
		pcie_bus_tune_off	Disable PCIe MPS (Max Payload Size)
				tuning and use the BIOS-configured MPS defaults.
		pcie_bus_safe	Set every device's MPS to the largest value
				supported by all devices below the root complex.
		pcie_bus_perf	Set device MPS to the largest allowable MPS
				based on its parent bus. Also set MRRS (Max
				Read Request Size) to the largest supported
				value (no larger than the MPS that the device
				or bus can support) for best performance.
		pcie_bus_peer2peer	Set every device's MPS to 128B, which
				every device is guaranteed to support. This
				configuration allows peer-to-peer DMA between
				any pair of devices, possibly at the cost of
				reduced performance.  This also guarantees
				that hot-added devices will work.
		cbiosize=nn[KMG]	The fixed amount of bus space which is
				reserved for the CardBus bridge's IO window.
				The default value is 256 bytes.
		cbmemsize=nn[KMG]	The fixed amount of bus space which is

				PCI-PCI bridge can be specified, if resource
				windows need to be expanded.

				end-to-end CRC checking).
				bios: Use BIOS/firmware settings. This is the
				the default.
				off: Turn ECRC off

			that purpose, where "x" is "b" for RCU-bh, "p"
			for RCU-preempt, and "s" for RCU-sched, and "N"

	rcutorture.nfakewriters= [KNL,BOOT]
			Set number of concurrent RCU writers.  These just
			stress RCU, they don't participate in the actual
			test, hence the "fake".

	rcutorture.nreaders= [KNL,BOOT]
			Set number of RCU readers.

	rcutorture.onoff_holdoff= [KNL,BOOT]
			Set time (s) after boot for CPU-hotplug testing.

	rcutorture.onoff_interval= [KNL,BOOT]
			Set time (s) between CPU-hotplug operations, or
			zero to disable CPU-hotplug testing.

	rcutorture.shuffle_interval= [KNL,BOOT]

	tpm_suspend_pcr=[HW,TPM]
			Format: integer pcr id
			Specify that at suspend time, the tpm driver
			should extend the specified pcr with zeros,
			as a workaround for some chips which fail to

			See also Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt "trace options"
			section.

	traceoff_on_warning
			[FTRACE] enable this option to disable tracing when a
			warning is hit. This turns off "tracing_on". Tracing can
			be enabled again by echoing '1' into the "tracing_on"
			file located in /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/

			This option is useful, as it disables the trace before
			the WARNING dump is called, which prevents the trace to
			be filled with content caused by the warning output.

			This option can also be set at run time via the sysctl
			option:  kernel/traceoff_on_warning

	vsyscall=	[X86-64]
			Controls the behavior of vsyscalls (i.e. calls to
			fixed addresses of 0xffffffffff600x00 from legacy
			code).  Most statically-linked binaries and older
			versions of glibc use these calls.  Because these
			functions are at fixed addresses, they make nice
			targets for exploits that can control RIP.

			emulate     [default] Vsyscalls turn into traps and are
			            emulated reasonably safely.

			native      Vsyscalls are native syscall instructions.
			            This is a little bit faster than trapping
			            and makes a few dynamic recompilers work
			            better than they would in emulation mode.
			            It also makes exploits much easier to write.

			none        Vsyscalls don't work at all.  This makes
			            them quite hard to use for exploits but
			            might break your system.

	workqueue.disable_numa
			By default, all work items queued to unbound
			workqueues are affine to the NUMA nodes they're
			issued on, which results in better behavior in
			general.  If NUMA affinity needs to be disabled for
			whatever reason, this option can be used.  Note
			that this also can be controlled per-workqueue for
			workqueues visible under /sys/bus/workqueue/.

	workqueue.power_efficient
			Per-cpu workqueues are generally preferred because
			they show better performance thanks to cache
			locality; unfortunately, per-cpu workqueues tend to
			be more power hungry than unbound workqueues.

			Enabling this makes the per-cpu workqueues which
			were observed to contribute significantly to power
			consumption unbound, leading to measurably lower
			power usage at the cost of small performance
			overhead.

			The default value of this parameter is determined by
			the config option CONFIG_WQ_POWER_EFFICIENT_DEFAULT.
