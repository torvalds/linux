February 2003             Kernel Parameters                     v2.5.59
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a consolidated list of the kernel parameters as implemented
(mostly) by the __setup() macro and sorted into English Dictionary order
(defined as ignoring all punctuation and sorting digits before letters in a
case insensitive manner), and with descriptions where known.

Module parameters for loadable modules are specified only as the
parameter name with optional '=' and value as appropriate, such as:

	modprobe usbcore blinkenlights=1

Module parameters for modules that are built into the kernel image
are specified on the kernel command line with the module name plus
'.' plus parameter name, with '=' and value if appropriate, such as:

	usbcore.blinkenlights=1

The text in square brackets at the beginning of the description states the
restrictions on the kernel for the said kernel parameter to be valid. The
restrictions referred to are that the relevant option is valid if:

	ACPI	ACPI support is enabled.
	ALSA	ALSA sound support is enabled.

			More X86-64 boot options can be found in
			Documentation/x86_64/boot-options.txt .

In addition, the following text indicates that the option:

	BUGS=	Relates to possible processor bugs on the said processor.
	KNL	Is a kernel start-up parameter.
	BOOT	Is a boot loader parameter.

Parameters denoted with BOOT are actually interpreted by the boot
loader, and have no meaning to the kernel directly.
Do not modify the syntax of boot loader parameters without extreme
need or coordination with <Documentation/i386/boot.txt>.

Note that ALL kernel parameters listed below are CASE SENSITIVE, and that
a trailing = on the name of any parameter states that that parameter will
be entered as an environment variable, whereas its absence indicates that
it will appear as a kernel argument readable via /proc/cmdline by programs
running once the system is up.

	lp=0		[LP]	Specify parallel ports to use, e.g,
	lp=port[,port...]	lp=none,parport0 (lp0 not configured, lp1 uses
	lp=reset		first parallel port). 'lp=0' disables the
	lp=auto			printer driver. 'lp=reset' (which can be
				specified in addition to the ports) causes
				attached printers to be reset. Using
				lp=port1,port2,... specifies the parallel ports
				to associate lp devices with, starting with
				lp0. A port specification may be 'none' to skip
				that lp device, or a parport name such as
				'parport0'. Specifying 'lp=auto' instead of a
				port specification list means that device IDs
				from each port should be examined, to see if
				an IEEE 1284-compliant printer is attached; if
				so, the driver will manage that printer.
				See also header of drivers/char/lp.c.

	lpj=n		[KNL]
			Sets loops_per_jiffy to given constant, thus avoiding
			time-consuming boot-time autodetection (up to 250 ms per
			CPU). 0 enables autodetection (default). To determine
			the correct value for your kernel, boot with normal
			autodetection and see what value is printed. Note that
			on SMP systems the preset will be applied to all CPUs,
			which is likely to cause problems if your CPUs need
			significantly divergent settings. An incorrect value
			will cause delays in the kernel to be wrong, leading to
			unpredictable I/O errors and other breakage. Although
			unlikely, in the extreme case this might damage your
			hardware.

	migration_cost=
			[KNL,SMP] debug: override scheduler migration costs
			Format: <level-1-usecs>,<level-2-usecs>,...
			This debugging option can be used to override the
			default scheduler migration cost matrix. The numbers
			are indexed by 'CPU domain distance'.
			E.g. migration_cost=1000,2000,3000 on an SMT NUMA
			box will set up an intra-core migration cost of
			1 msec, an inter-core migration cost of 2 msecs,
			and an inter-node migration cost of 3 msecs.

			WARNING: using the wrong values here can break
			scheduler performance, so it's only for scheduler
			development purposes, not production environments.

	migration_debug=
			[KNL,SMP] migration cost auto-detect verbosity
			Format=<0|1|2>
			If a system's migration matrix reported at bootup
			seems erroneous then this option can be used to
			increase verbosity of the detection process.
			We default to 0 (no extra messages), 1 will print
			some more information, and 2 will be really
			verbose (probably only useful if you also have a
			serial console attached to the system).

	migration_factor=
			[KNL,SMP] multiply/divide migration costs by a factor
			Format=<percent>
			This debug option can be used to proportionally
			increase or decrease the auto-detected migration
			costs for all entries of the migration matrix.
			E.g. migration_factor=150 will increase migration
			costs by 50%. (and thus the scheduler will be less
			eager migrating cache-hot tasks)
			migration_factor=80 will decrease migration costs
			by 20%. (thus the scheduler will be more eager to
			migrate tasks)

			WARNING: using the wrong values here can break
			scheduler performance, so it's only for scheduler
			development purposes, not production environments.

			instruction doesn't work correctly and not to
			use it.

	nohalt		[IA-64] Tells the kernel not to use the power saving
			function PAL_HALT_LIGHT when idle. This increases
			power-consumption. On the positive side, it reduces

	parport=	[HW,PPT] Specify parallel ports. 0 disables.
			Format: { 0 | auto | 0xBBB[,IRQ[,DMA]] }
			Use 'auto' to force the driver to use any
			IRQ/DMA settings detected (the default is to
			ignore detected IRQ/DMA settings because of
			possible conflicts). You can specify the base
			address, IRQ, and DMA settings; IRQ and DMA
			should be numbers, or 'auto' (for using detected
			settings on that particular port), or 'nofifo'
			(to avoid using a FIFO even if it is detected).
			Parallel ports are assigned in the order they
			are specified on the command line, starting
			with parport0.

		bios		[IA-32] force use of PCI BIOS, don't access
				the hardware directly. Use this if your machine
				has a non-standard PCI host bridge.
		nobios		[IA-32] disallow use of PCI BIOS, only direct
				hardware access methods are allowed. Use this
				if you experience crashes upon bootup and you
				suspect they are caused by the BIOS.
		conf1		[IA-32] Force use of PCI Configuration
				Mechanism 1.
		conf2		[IA-32] Force use of PCI Configuration
				Mechanism 2.
		nommconf	[IA-32,X86_64] Disable use of MMCONFIG for PCI
				Configuration
		nosort		[IA-32] Don't sort PCI devices according to
				order given by the PCI BIOS. This sorting is
				done to get a device order compatible with
				older kernels.
		biosirq		[IA-32] Use PCI BIOS calls to get the interrupt
				routing table. These calls are known to be buggy
				on several machines and they hang the machine
				when used, but on other computers it's the only
				way to get the interrupt routing table. Try
				this option if the kernel is unable to allocate
				IRQs or discover secondary PCI buses on your
				motherboard.
		rom		[IA-32] Assign address space to expansion ROMs.
				Use with caution as certain devices share
				address decoders between ROMs and other
				resources.
		irqmask=0xMMMM	[IA-32] Set a bit mask of IRQs allowed to be
				assigned automatically to PCI devices. You can
				make the kernel exclude IRQs of your ISA cards
				this way.
		pirqaddr=0xAAAAA	[IA-32] Specify the physical address
				of the PIRQ table (normally generated
				by the BIOS) if it is outside the
				F0000h-100000h range.
		lastbus=N	[IA-32] Scan all buses thru bus #N. Can be
				useful if the kernel is unable to find your
				secondary buses and you want to tell it
				explicitly which ones they are.
		assign-busses	[IA-32] Always assign all PCI bus
				numbers ourselves, overriding
				whatever the firmware may have done.
		usepirqmask	[IA-32] Honor the possible IRQ mask stored
				in the BIOS $PIR table. This is needed on
				some systems with broken BIOSes, notably
				some HP Pavilion N5400 and Omnibook XE3
				notebooks. This will have no effect if ACPI
				IRQ routing is enabled.
		noacpi		[IA-32] Do not use ACPI for IRQ routing
				or for PCI scanning.
		routeirq	Do IRQ routing for all PCI devices.
				This is normally done in pci_enable_device(),
				so this option is a temporary workaround
				for broken drivers that don't call it.
		firmware	[ARM] Do not re-enumerate the bus but instead
				just use the configuration from the
				bootloader. This is currently used on
				IXP2000 systems where the bus has to be
				configured a certain way for adjunct CPUs.
