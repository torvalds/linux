Generic vcpu interface
====================================

The virtual cpu "device" also accepts the ioctls KVM_SET_DEVICE_ATTR,
KVM_GET_DEVICE_ATTR, and KVM_HAS_DEVICE_ATTR. The interface uses the same struct
kvm_device_attr as other devices, but targets VCPU-wide settings and controls.

The groups and attributes per virtual cpu, if any, are architecture specific.
