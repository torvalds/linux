ARM Virtual Generic Interrupt Controller (VGIC)
===============================================

Device types supported:
  KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC_V2     ARM Generic Interrupt Controller v2.0

Only one VGIC instance may be instantiated through either this API or the
legacy KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP api.  The created VGIC will act as the VM interrupt
controller, requiring emulated user-space devices to inject interrupts to the
VGIC instead of directly to CPUs.

Groups:
  KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_ADDR
  Attributes:
    KVM_VGIC_V2_ADDR_TYPE_DIST (rw, 64-bit)
      Base address in the guest physical address space of the GIC distributor
      register mappings.

    KVM_VGIC_V2_ADDR_TYPE_CPU (rw, 64-bit)
      Base address in the guest physical address space of the GIC virtual cpu
      interface register mappings.

  KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_DIST_REGS
  Attributes:
    The attr field of kvm_device_attr encodes two values:
    bits:     | 63   ....  40 | 39 ..  32  |  31   ....    0 |
    values:   |    reserved   |   cpu id   |      offset     |

    All distributor regs are (rw, 32-bit)

    The offset is relative to the "Distributor base address" as defined in the
    GICv2 specs.  Getting or setting such a register has the same effect as
    reading or writing the register on the actual hardware from the cpu
    specified with cpu id field.  Note that most distributor fields are not
    banked, but return the same value regardless of the cpu id used to access
    the register.
  Limitations:
    - Priorities are not implemented, and registers are RAZ/WI
  Errors:
    -ENODEV: Getting or setting this register is not yet supported
    -EBUSY: One or more VCPUs are running

  KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_CPU_REGS
  Attributes:
    The attr field of kvm_device_attr encodes two values:
    bits:     | 63   ....  40 | 39 ..  32  |  31   ....    0 |
    values:   |    reserved   |   cpu id   |      offset     |

    All CPU interface regs are (rw, 32-bit)

    The offset specifies the offset from the "CPU interface base address" as
    defined in the GICv2 specs.  Getting or setting such a register has the
    same effect as reading or writing the register on the actual hardware.

    The Active Priorities Registers APRn are implementation defined, so we set a
    fixed format for our implementation that fits with the model of a "GICv2
    implementation without the security extensions" which we present to the
    guest.  This interface always exposes four register APR[0-3] describing the
    maximum possible 128 preemption levels.  The semantics of the register
    indicate if any interrupts in a given preemption level are in the active
    state by setting the corresponding bit.

    Thus, preemption level X has one or more active interrupts if and only if:

      APRn[X mod 32] == 0b1,  where n = X / 32

    Bits for undefined preemption levels are RAZ/WI.

  Limitations:
    - Priorities are not implemented, and registers are RAZ/WI
  Errors:
    -ENODEV: Getting or setting this register is not yet supported
    -EBUSY: One or more VCPUs are running

  KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_NR_IRQS
  Attributes:
    A value describing the number of interrupts (SGI, PPI and SPI) for
    this GIC instance, ranging from 64 to 1024, in increments of 32.

  Errors:
    -EINVAL: Value set is out of the expected range
    -EBUSY: Value has already be set, or GIC has already been initialized
            with default values.
