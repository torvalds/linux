Code documentation
------------------

Given a kernel configuration, the kernel may generate Rust code documentation,
i.e. HTML rendered by the ``rustdoc`` tool.

.. only:: rustdoc and html

	This kernel documentation was built with `Rust code documentation
	<rustdoc/kernel/index.html>`_.

.. only:: not rustdoc and html

	This kernel documentation was not built with Rust code documentation.

A pregenerated version is provided at:

	https://rust.docs.kernel.org

Please see the :ref:`Code documentation <rust_code_documentation>` section for
more details.
