Default video modes
-------------------
At the moment, there are two kernel command line arguments supported:

mode:640x480
mode:800x600
	or
mode:1024x768

Full support for startup video modes (modedb) will be integrated soon.

Version 1.9.9.1
---------------
* Fix memory detection for 512kB case
* 800x600 mode
* Fixed timings
* Hint for AXP: Use -accel false -vyres -1 when changing resolution


Version 1.9.4.4
---------------
* Preliminary Laguna support
* Overhaul color register routines.
* Associated with the above, console colors are now obtained from a LUT
  called 'palette' instead of from the VGA registers.  This code was
  modeled after that in atyfb and matroxfb.
* Code cleanup, add comments.
* Overhaul SR07 handling.
* Bug fixes.


Version 1.9.4.3
---------------
* Correctly set default startup video mode.
* Do not override ram size setting.  Define
  CLGEN_USE_HARDCODED_RAM_SETTINGS if you _do_ want to override the RAM
  setting.
* Compile fixes related to new 2.3.x IORESOURCE_IO[PORT] symbol changes.
* Use new 2.3.x resource allocation.
* Some code cleanup.


Version 1.9.4.2
---------------
* Casting fixes.
* Assertions no longer cause an oops on purpose.
* Bug fixes.


Version 1.9.4.1
---------------
* Add compatibility support.  Now requires a 2.1.x, 2.2.x or 2.3.x kernel.


Version 1.9.4
-------------
* Several enhancements, smaller memory footprint, a few bugfixes.
* Requires kernel 2.3.14-pre1 or later.


Version 1.9.3
-------------
* Bundled with kernel 2.3.14-pre1 or later.
