How to use it?
==============

efifb does not have any kind of autodetection of your machine.
You have to add the following kernel parameters in your elilo.conf:
	Macbook :
		video=efifb:macbook
	MacMini :
		video=efifb:mini
	Macbook Pro 15", iMac 17" :
		video=efifb:i17
	Macbook Pro 17", iMac 20" :
		video=efifb:i20

Accepted options:

nowc	Don't map the framebuffer write combined. This can be used
	to workaround side-effects and slowdowns on other CPU cores
	when large amounts of console data are written.
