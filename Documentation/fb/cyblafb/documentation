Apollo PLE 133 Chipset VT8601A North Bridge Datasheet, Rev. 1.82, October 22,
2001, available from VIA:

	http://www.viavpsd.com/product/6/15/DS8601A182.pdf

The datasheet is incomplete, some registers that need to be programmed are not
explained at all and important bits are listed as "reserved". But you really
need the datasheet to understand the code.  "p. xxx" comments refer to page
numbers of this document.

XFree/XOrg drivers are available and of good quality, looking at the code
there is a good idea if the datasheet does not provide enough information
or if the datasheet seems to be wrong.
