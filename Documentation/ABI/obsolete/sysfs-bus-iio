Description:
		Description of the scan element data storage within the buffer
		and hence the form in which it is read from user-space.
		Form is [be|le]:[s|u]bits/storagebits[>>shift].
		be or le specifies big or little endian. s or u specifies if
		signed (2's complement) or unsigned. bits is the number of bits
		of data and storagebits is the space (after padding) that it
		occupies in the buffer. shift if specified, is the shift that
		needs to be applied prior to masking out unused bits. Some
		devices put their data in the middle of the transferred elements
		with additional information on both sides.  Note that some
		devices will have additional information in the unused bits
		so to get a clean value, the bits value must be used to mask
		the buffer output value appropriately.  The storagebits value
		also specifies the data alignment.  So s48/64>>2 will be a
		signed 48 bit integer stored in a 64 bit location aligned to
		a 64 bit boundary. To obtain the clean value, shift right 2
		and apply a mask to zero the top 16 bits of the result.
		For other storage combinations this attribute will be extended
		appropriately.

		Since kernel 5.11 the scan_elements attributes are merged into
		the bufferY directory, to be configurable per buffer.

KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Description:
		A single positive integer specifying the position of this
		scan element in the buffer. Note these are not dependent on
		what is enabled and may not be contiguous. Thus for user-space
		to establish the full layout these must be used in conjunction
		with all _en attributes to establish which channels are present,
		and the relevant _type attributes to establish the data storage
		format.

		Since kernel 5.11 the scan_elements attributes are merged into
		the bufferY directory, to be configurable per buffer.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/buffer/watermark
KernelVersion:	4.2
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		A single positive integer specifying the maximum number of scan
		elements to wait for.

		Poll will block until the watermark is reached.

		Blocking read will wait until the minimum between the requested
		read amount or the low water mark is available.

		Non-blocking read will retrieve the available samples from the
		buffer even if there are less samples then watermark level. This
		allows the application to block on poll with a timeout and read
		the available samples after the timeout expires and thus have a
		maximum delay guarantee.

		Since Kernel 5.11, multiple buffers are supported.
		so, it is better to use, instead:

			/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/bufferY/watermark

Description:
		A read-only value indicating the bytes of data available in the
		buffer. In the case of an output buffer, this indicates the
		amount of empty space available to write data to. In the case of
		an input buffer, this indicates the amount of data available for
		reading.

		Since Kernel 5.11, multiple buffers are supported.
