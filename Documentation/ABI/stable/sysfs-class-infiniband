Date:		May, 2016
KernelVersion:	4.6
Contact:	linux-rdma@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		The optional "hw_counters" subdirectory can be under either the
		parent device or the port subdirectories or both. If present,
		there are a list of counters provided by the hardware. They may
		match some of the counters in the counters directory, but they
		often include many other counters. In addition to the various
		counters, there will be a file named "lifespan" that configures
		how frequently the core should update the counters when they are
		being accessed (counters are not updated if they are not being
		accessed). The lifespan is in milliseconds and defaults to 10
		unless set to something else by the driver. Users may echo a
		value between 0-10000 to the lifespan file to set the length
		of time between updates in milliseconds.

Date:		Aug, 2012
KernelVersion:	v3.6.15
Contact:	linux-rdma@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		The sysfs iov directory is used to manage and examine the port
		P_Key and guid paravirtualization. This directory is added only
		for the master -- slaves do not have it.

		Under iov/ports, the administrator may examine the gid and P_Key
		tables as they are present in the device (and as are seen in the
		"network view" presented to the SM).

		The "pkeys" and "gids" subdirectories contain one file for each
		entry in the port's P_Key or GID table respectively. For
		example, ports/1/pkeys/10 contains the value at index 10 in port
		1's P_Key table.

		======================= ==========================================
		gids/<n>:		(RO) The physical port gids n = 0..127

		admin_guids/<n>:	(RW) Allows examining or changing the
					administrative state of a given GUID
					n = 0..127

		pkeys/<n>:		(RO) Displays the contents of the physical
					key table n = 0..126

		mcgs/:			(RO) Muticast group table

		<m>/gid_idx/0:		(RO) Display the GID mapping m = 1..2

		<m>/pkey_idx/<n>:	(RW) Writable except for RoCE pkeys.
					m = 1..2, n = 0..126

					Under the iov/<pci slot number>
					directories, the admin may map the index
					numbers in the physical tables (as under
					iov/ports) to the paravirtualized index
					numbers that guests see.

					For example, if the administrator, for
					port 1 on guest 2 maps physical pkey
					index 10 to virtual index 1, then that
					guest, whenever it uses its pkey index
					1, will actually be using the real pkey
					index 10.

Description:
		sdma<N>/ contains one directory per sdma engine (0 - 15)

		=============== ==============================================
		cpu_list:	(RW) List of cpus for user-process to sdma
				engine assignment.

		vl:		(RO) Displays the virtual lane (vl) the sdma
				engine maps to.
		=============== ==============================================

		This interface gives the user control on the affinity settings
		for the device. As an example, to set an sdma engine irq
		affinity and thread affinity of a user processes to use the
		sdma engine, which is "near" in terms of NUMA configuration, or
		physical cpu location, the user will do::

		  echo "3" > /proc/irq/<N>/smp_affinity_list
		  echo "4-7" > /sys/devices/.../sdma3/cpu_list
		  cat /sys/devices/.../sdma3/vl
		  0
		  echo "8" > /proc/irq/<M>/smp_affinity_list
		  echo "9-12" > /sys/devices/.../sdma4/cpu_list
		  cat /sys/devices/.../sdma4/vl
		  1

		to make sure that when a process runs on cpus 4,5,6, or 7, and
		uses vl=0, then sdma engine 3 is selected by the driver, and
		also the interrupt of the sdma engine 3 is steered to cpu 3.
		Similarly, when a process runs on cpus 9,10,11, or 12 and sets
		vl=1, then engine 4 will be selected and the irq of the sdma
		engine 4 is steered to cpu 8.  This assumes that in the above N
		is the irq number of "sdma3", and M is irq number of "sdma4" in
		the /proc/interrupts file.
