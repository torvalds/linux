		See IEEE 1212 for semantic definitions.

		config_rom
			Contents of the Configuration ROM register.
			Binary attribute; an array of host-endian u32.

		guid
			The node's EUI-64 in the bus information block of
			Configuration ROM.

Description:
		IEEE 1394 node device attribute.
		Read-only.  Mutable during the node device's lifetime.
		See IEEE 1212 for semantic definitions.

		units
			Summary of all units present in an IEEE 1394 node.
			Contains space-separated tuples of specifier_id and
			version of each unit present in the node.  Specifier_id
			and version are hexadecimal string representations of
			u24 of the respective unit directory entries.
			Specifier_id and version within each tuple are separated
			by a colon.

Description:
		Attributes common to IEEE 1394 node devices and unit devices.
		Read-only.  Mutable during the node device's lifetime.
		Immutable during the unit device's lifetime.
		See IEEE 1212 for semantic definitions.

		These attributes are only created if the root directory of an
		IEEE 1394 node or the unit directory of an IEEE 1394 unit
		actually contains according entries.

		hardware_version
			Hexadecimal string representation of an u24.

		hardware_version_name
			Contents of a respective textual descriptor leaf.

		model
			Hexadecimal string representation of an u24.

		model_name
			Contents of a respective textual descriptor leaf.

		specifier_id
			Hexadecimal string representation of an u24.
			Mandatory in unit directories according to IEEE 1212.

		vendor
			Hexadecimal string representation of an u24.
			Mandatory in the root directory according to IEEE 1212.

		vendor_name
			Contents of a respective textual descriptor leaf.

		version
			Hexadecimal string representation of an u24.
			Mandatory in unit directories according to IEEE 1212.

Description:
		SCSI target port identifier and logical unit identifier of a
		logical unit of an SBP-2 target.  The identifiers are specified
		in SAM-2...SAM-4 annex A.  They are persistent and world-wide
		unique properties the SBP-2 attached target.

		Read-only attribute, immutable during the target's lifetime.
		Format, as exposed by firewire-sbp2 since 2.6.22, May 2007:
		Colon-separated hexadecimal string representations of
			u64 EUI-64 : u24 directory_ID : u16 LUN
		without 0x prefixes, without whitespace.  The former sbp2 driver
		(removed in 2.6.37 after being superseded by firewire-sbp2) used
		a somewhat shorter format which was not as close to SAM.
