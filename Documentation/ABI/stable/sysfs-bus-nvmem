Date:		June 2024
KernelVersion:	6.11
Contact:	Marek Vasut <marex@denx.de>
Description:
		This read/write attribute allows users to set read-write
		devices as read-only and back to read-write from userspace.
		This can be used to unlock and relock write-protection of
		devices which are generally locked, except during sporadic
		programming operation.
		Read returns '0' or '1' for read-write or read-only modes
		respectively.
		Write parses one of 'YyTt1NnFf0', or [oO][NnFf] for "on"
		and "off", i.e. what kstrbool() supports.
		Note: This file is only present if CONFIG_NVMEM_SYSFS
		is enabled.
