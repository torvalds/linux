What:		/sys/class/ubi/version
Date:		July 2006
KernelVersion:	2.6.22
Contact:	Artem Bityutskiy <dedekind@infradead.org>
Description:
		This file contains version of the latest supported UBI on-media
		format. Currently it is 1, and there is no plan to change this.
		However, if in the future UBI needs on-flash format changes
		which cannot be done in a compatible manner, a new format
		version will be added. So this is a mechanism for possible
		future backward-compatible (but forward-incompatible)
		improvements.

		this volume has to be aligned on. For example, 2048 means that
		logical eraseblock size is multiple of 2048. In other words,
		volume logical eraseblock size is UBI device logical eraseblock
		size aligned to the alignment value.

		only for static volumes, and for dynamic volume it equivalent
		to the total volume size in bytes.

Contact:	Artem Bityutskiy <dedekind@infradead.org>

		Contains ASCII "0\n" if the update marker is not set for this
		volume, and "1\n" if it is set. The update marker is set when
		volume update starts, and cleaned when it ends. So the presence
		of the update marker indicates that the volume is being updated
		at the moment of the update was interrupted. The later may be
		checked using the "corrupted" sysfs file.
