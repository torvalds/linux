Description:
		This directory exposes interfaces for interacting with
		the FSP and platform dumps through OPAL firmware interface.

		This is only for the powerpc/powernv platform.

		initiate_dump:	When '1' is written to it,
				we will initiate a dump.
				Read this file for supported commands.

		0xXX-0xYYYY:	A directory for dump of type 0xXX and
				id 0xYYYY (in hex). The name of this
				directory should not be relied upon to
				be in this format, only that it's unique
				among all dumps. For determining the type
				and ID of the dump, use the id and type files.
				Do not rely on any particular size of dump
				type or dump id.

		Each dump has the following files:
		id:		An ASCII representation of the dump ID
				in hex (e.g. '0x01')
		type:		An ASCII representation of the type of
				dump in the format "0x%x %s" with the ID
				in hex and a description of the dump type
				(or 'unknown').
				Type '0xffffffff unknown' is used when
				we could not get the type from firmware.
				e.g. '0x02 System/Platform Dump'
		dump:		A binary file containing the dump.
				The size of the dump is the size of this file.
		acknowledge:	When 'ack' is written to this, we will
				acknowledge that we've retrieved the
				dump to the service processor. It will
				then remove it, making the dump
				inaccessible.
				Reading this file will get a list of
				supported actions.
