What:		/sys/o2cb symlink
Date:		May 2011
KernelVersion:	2.6.40
Contact:	ocfs2-devel@oss.oracle.com
Description:	This is a symlink: /sys/o2cb to /sys/fs/o2cb. The symlink is
		removed when new versions of ocfs2-tools which know to look
		in /sys/fs/o2cb are sufficiently prevalent. Don't code new
		software to look here, it should try /sys/fs/o2cb instead.
Users:		ocfs2-tools. It's sufficient to mail proposed changes to
		ocfs2-devel@oss.oracle.com.
