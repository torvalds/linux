What:		devfs
Date:		July 2005 (scheduled), finally removed in kernel v2.6.18
Contact:	Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
Description:
	devfs has been unmaintained for a number of years, has unfixable
	races, contains a naming policy within the kernel that is
	against the LSB, and can be replaced by using udev.
	The files fs/devfs/*, include/linux/devfs_fs*.h were removed,
	along with the assorted devfs function calls throughout the
	kernel tree.
