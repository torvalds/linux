Description:	The <bdf> is related the function for PF and VF.
		ZIP driver supports to configure each function's QoS, the driver
		supports to write <bdf> value to alg_qos in the host. Such as
		"echo <bdf> value > alg_qos". The qos value is 1~1000, means
		1/1000~1000/1000 of total QoS. The driver reading alg_qos to
		get related QoS in the host and VM, Such as "cat alg_qos".
