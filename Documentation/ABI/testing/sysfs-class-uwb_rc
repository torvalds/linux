                Wideband MAC and PHY Specification' is assumed.

Description:
                If no beacons are received from a device for at least
                this time, the device will be considered to have gone
                and it will be removed.  The default is 3 superframes
                (~197 ms) as required by the specification.

Description:
                Write:

                <channel>

                to force a specific channel to be used when beaconing,
                or, if <channel> is -1, to prohibit beaconing.  If
                <channel> is 0, then the default channel selection
                algorithm will be used.  Valid channels depends on the
                radio controller's supported band groups.

                Reading returns the currently active channel, or -1 if
                the radio controller is not beaconing.

                Reading returns the current ASIE.  Writing replaces
                the current ASIE with the one written.
