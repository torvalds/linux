Note: Attributes that are shared between devices are stored in the directory
pointed to by the symlink device/.
Example: The real path of the attribute /sys/class/cxl/afu0.0s/irqs_max is
/sys/class/cxl/afu0.0s/device/irqs_max, i.e. /sys/class/cxl/afu0.0/irqs_max.

                AFU Error Buffer contents. The contents of this file are
		application specific and depends on the AFU being used.
		Applications interacting with the AFU can use this attribute
		to know about the current error condition and take appropriate
		action like logging the event etc.

                Decimal value of maximum number of interrupts that can be
                requested by userspace.  The default on probe is the maximum
                that hardware can support (eg. 2037). Write values will limit
                userspace applications to that many userspace interrupts. Must
                be >= irqs_min.

Date:           December 2014
Contact:        linuxppc-dev@lists.ozlabs.org
Description:    read/write
                Valid entries are "none", "user", and "factory".
                "none" means PERST will not cause image to be loaded to the
                card.  A power cycle is required to load the image.
                "none" could be useful for debugging because the trace arrays
                are preserved.
                "user" and "factory" means PERST will cause either the user or
                user or factory image to be loaded.
                Default is to reload on PERST whichever image the card has
                loaded.
