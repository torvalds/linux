What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/countY/ceiling
KernelVersion:	5.2

What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/countY/count_mode
KernelVersion:	5.2
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Count mode for channel Y. The ceiling and floor values for
		Count Y are used by the count mode where required. The following
		count modes are available:

		normal:
			Counting is continuous in either direction.

		range limit:
			An upper or lower limit is set, mimicking limit switches
			in the mechanical counterpart. The upper limit is set to
			the Count Y ceiling value, while the lower limit is set
			to the Count Y floor value. The counter freezes at
			count = ceiling when counting up, and at count = floor
			when counting down. At either of these limits, the
			counting is resumed only when the count direction is
			reversed.

		non-recycle:
			The counter is disabled whenever a counter overflow or
			underflow takes place. The counter is re-enabled when a
			new count value is loaded to the counter via a preset
			operation or direct write.

		modulo-n:
			A count value boundary is set between the Count Y floor
			value and the Count Y ceiling value. The counter is
			reset to the Count Y floor value at count = ceiling when
			counting up, while the counter is set to the Count Y
			ceiling value at count = floor when counting down; the
			counter does not freeze at the boundary points, but
			counts continuously throughout.

What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/countY/direction
KernelVersion:	5.2
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Read-only attribute that indicates the count direction of Count
		Y. Two count directions are available: forward and backward.

		Some counter devices are able to determine the direction of
		their counting. For example, quadrature encoding counters can
		determine the direction of movement by evaluating the leading
		phase of the respective A and B quadrature encoding signals.
		This attribute exposes such count directions.

		boolean.

		This attribute is intended to serve as a pause/unpause mechanism
		for Count Y. Suppose a counter device is used to count the total
		movement of a conveyor belt: this attribute allows an operator
		to temporarily pause the counter, service the conveyor belt,
		and then finally unpause the counter to continue where it had
		left off.

			signal B updates the respective count; if the direction
			is backward, falling edges on quadrature pair signal B

			Any state transition on quadrature pair signal A updates
			the respective count. Quadrature encoding determines the
			direction.

		quadrature x2 b:
			Any state transition on quadrature pair signal B updates
			the respective count. Quadrature encoding determines the
			direction.

		quadrature x4:
			Any state transition on either quadrature pair signals
			updates	the respective count. Quadrature encoding
			determines the direction.
