What:		/sys/class/rc/
Date:		Apr 2010
KernelVersion:	2.6.35
Contact:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
Description:
		The rc/ class sub-directory belongs to the Remote Controller
		core and provides a sysfs interface for configuring infrared
		remote controller receivers.

What:		/sys/class/rc/rcN/
Date:		Apr 2010
KernelVersion:	2.6.35
Contact:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
Description:
		A /sys/class/rc/rcN directory is created for each remote
		control receiver device where N is the number of the receiver.

What:		/sys/class/rc/rcN/protocols
Date:		Jun 2010
KernelVersion:	2.6.36
Contact:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
Description:
		Reading this file returns a list of available protocols,
		something like:
		    "rc5 [rc6] nec jvc [sony]"
		Enabled protocols are shown in [] brackets.
		Writing "+proto" will add a protocol to the list of enabled
		protocols.
		Writing "-proto" will remove a protocol from the list of enabled
		protocols.
		Writing "proto" will enable only "proto".
		Writing "none" will disable all protocols.
		Write fails with EINVAL if an invalid protocol combination or
		unknown protocol name is used.

What:		/sys/class/rc/rcN/filter
Date:		Jan 2014
KernelVersion:	3.15
Contact:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
Description:
		Sets the scancode filter expected value.
		Use in combination with /sys/class/rc/rcN/filter_mask to set the
		expected value of the bits set in the filter mask.
		If the hardware supports it then scancodes which do not match
		the filter will be ignored. Otherwise the write will fail with
		an error.
		This value may be reset to 0 if the current protocol is altered.

What:		/sys/class/rc/rcN/filter_mask
Date:		Jan 2014
KernelVersion:	3.15
Contact:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
Description:
		Sets the scancode filter mask of bits to compare.
		Use in combination with /sys/class/rc/rcN/filter to set the bits
		of the scancode which should be compared against the expected
		value. A value of 0 disables the filter to allow all valid
		scancodes to be processed.
		If the hardware supports it then scancodes which do not match
		the filter will be ignored. Otherwise the write will fail with
		an error.
		This value may be reset to 0 if the current protocol is altered.

What:		/sys/class/rc/rcN/wakeup_protocols
Date:		Feb 2017
KernelVersion:	4.11
Contact:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
Description:
		Reading this file returns a list of available protocols to use
		for the wakeup filter, something like:
		    "rc-5 nec nec-x rc-6-0 rc-6-6a-24 [rc-6-6a-32] rc-6-mce"
		Note that protocol variants are listed, so "nec", "sony",
		"rc-5", "rc-6" have their different bit length encodings
		listed if available.
		The enabled wakeup protocol is shown in [] brackets.
		Only one protocol can be selected at a time.
		Writing "proto" will use "proto" for wakeup events.
		Writing "none" will disable wakeup.
		Write fails with EINVAL if an invalid protocol combination or
		unknown protocol name is used, or if wakeup is not supported by
		the hardware.

What:		/sys/class/rc/rcN/wakeup_filter
Date:		Jan 2014
KernelVersion:	3.15
Contact:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
Description:
		Sets the scancode wakeup filter expected value.
		Use in combination with /sys/class/rc/rcN/wakeup_filter_mask to
		set the expected value of the bits set in the wakeup filter mask
		to trigger a system wake event.
		If the hardware supports it and wakeup_filter_mask is not 0 then
		scancodes which match the filter will wake the system from e.g.
		suspend to RAM or power off.
		Otherwise the write will fail with an error.
		This value may be reset to 0 if the wakeup protocol is altered.
