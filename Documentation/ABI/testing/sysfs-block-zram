Date:		February 2014
Contact:	Sergey Senozhatsky <sergey.senozhatsky@gmail.com>
Description:
		The failed_reads file is read-only and specifies the number of
		failed reads happened on this device.

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/failed_writes
Date:		February 2014

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/max_comp_streams
Date:		February 2014
Contact:	Sergey Senozhatsky <sergey.senozhatsky@gmail.com>
Description:
		The max_comp_streams file is read-write and specifies the
		number of backend's zcomp_strm compression streams (number of
		concurrent compress operations).

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/comp_algorithm
Date:		February 2014
Contact:	Sergey Senozhatsky <sergey.senozhatsky@gmail.com>
Description:
		The comp_algorithm file is read-write and lets to show
		available and selected compression algorithms, change
		compression algorithm selection.

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/notify_free
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The notify_free file is read-only and specifies the number of
		swap slot free notifications received by this device. These
		notifications are send to a swap block device when a swap slot
		is freed. This statistic is applicable only when this disk is
		being used as a swap disk.

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/discard
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The discard file is read-only and specifies the number of
		discard requests received by this device. These requests
		provide information to block device regarding blocks which are
		no longer used by filesystem.

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/zero_pages
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The zero_pages file is read-only and specifies number of zero
		filled pages written to this disk. No memory is allocated for
		such pages.

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/orig_data_size
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The orig_data_size file is read-only and specifies uncompressed
		size of data stored in this disk. This excludes zero-filled
		pages (zero_pages) since no memory is allocated for them.
		Unit: bytes

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/compr_data_size
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The compr_data_size file is read-only and specifies compressed
		size of data stored in this disk. So, compression ratio can be
		calculated using orig_data_size and this statistic.
		Unit: bytes

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/mem_used_total
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The mem_used_total file is read-only and specifies the amount
		of memory, including allocator fragmentation and metadata
		overhead, allocated for this disk. So, allocator space
		efficiency can be calculated using compr_data_size and this
		statistic.
		Unit: bytes

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/mem_limit
Date:		August 2014
Contact:	Minchan Kim <minchan@kernel.org>
Description:
		The mem_limit file is read/write and specifies the maximum
		amount of memory ZRAM can use to store the compressed data.  The
		limit could be changed in run time and "0" means disable the
		limit.  No limit is the initial state.  Unit: bytes
