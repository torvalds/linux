		can preempt lower priority atoms currently running on the GPU,
		even if they belong to a different context.

		Writing 1 to this attribute set it to the mode were the
		highest-priority atom will be chosen from each context in turn
		using a round-robin algorithm, so priority only has an effect
		within the context an atom belongs to. Newly-runnable higher
		priority atoms can preempt the lower priority atoms currently
		running on the GPU, but only if they belong to the same context.

What:           /sys/class/misc/mali%u/device/mcu_shader_pwroff_timeout
Description:
		This attribute is available only with mali platform
		device-driver that supports a CSF GPU. The duration value unit
		is in micro-seconds and is used for configuring MCU shader Core power-off
		timer. The configured MCU shader Core power-off timer will only have
		effect when the host driver has delegated the shader cores
		power management to MCU. The supplied value will be
		recorded internally without any change. But the actual field
		value will be subject to core power-off timer source frequency
		scaling and maximum value limiting. The default source will be
		SYSTEM_TIMESTAMP counter. But in case the platform is not able
		to supply it, the GPU CYCLE_COUNTER source will be used as an
		alternative.

		If we set the value to zero then MCU-controlled shader/tiler
		power management will be disabled.
