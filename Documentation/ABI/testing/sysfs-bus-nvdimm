Description:	(RO) Attribute group to describe the magic bits
		that go into perf_event_attr.config for a particular pmu.
		(See ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-event_source-devices-format).

		Each attribute under this group defines a bit range of the
		perf_event_attr.config. Supported attribute is listed
		below::
		  event  = "config:0-4"  - event ID

		For example::
			ctl_res_cnt = "event=0x1"

Description:	(RO) Attribute group to describe performance monitoring events
                for the nvdimm memory device. Each attribute in this group
                describes a single performance monitoring event supported by
                this nvdimm pmu.  The name of the file is the name of the event.
                (See ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-event_source-devices-events). A
                listing of the events supported by a given nvdimm provider type
                can be found in Documentation/driver-api/nvdimm/$provider.

Description:	(RO) Shows the CXL bridge device that ties to a CXL memory device
		to this NVDIMM device. I.e. the parent of the device returned is
		a /sys/bus/cxl/devices/memX instance.
