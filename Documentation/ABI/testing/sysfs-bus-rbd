Description:

Being used for adding and removing rbd block devices.

Usage: <mon ip addr> <options> <pool name> <rbd image name> [snap name]

 $ echo "192.168.0.1 name=admin rbd foo" > /sys/bus/rbd/add

The snapshot name can be "-" or omitted to map the image read/write. A <dev-id>
will be assigned for any registered block device. If snapshot is used, it will
be mapped read-only.

Removal of a device:

  $ echo <dev-id> > /sys/bus/rbd/remove
