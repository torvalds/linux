Date:		March 2018
Contact:	linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This file contains the auto-hibernate idle timer setting of a
		UFS host controller. A value of '0' means auto-hibernate is not
		enabled. Otherwise the value is the number of microseconds of
		idle time before the UFS host controller will autonomously put
		the link into hibernate state. That will save power at the
		expense of increased latency. Note that the hardware supports
		10-bit values with a power-of-ten multiplier which allows a
		maximum value of 102300000. Refer to the UFS Host Controller
		Interface specification for more details.
