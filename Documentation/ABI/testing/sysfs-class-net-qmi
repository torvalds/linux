What:		/sys/class/net/<iface>/qmi/raw_ip
Date:		Dec 2015
KernelVersion:	4.4
Contact:	Bjørn Mork <bjorn@mork.no>
Description:
		Boolean.  Default: 'N'

		Set this to 'Y' to change the network device link
		framing from '802.3' to 'raw-ip'.

		The netdev will change to reflect the link framing
		mode.  The netdev is an ordinary ethernet device in
		'802.3' mode, and the driver expects to exchange
		frames with an ethernet header over the USB link. The
		netdev is a headerless p-t-p device in 'raw-ip' mode,
		and the driver expects to echange IPv4 or IPv6 packets
		without any L2 header over the USB link.

		Userspace is in full control of firmware configuration
		through the delegation of the QMI protocol. Userspace
		is responsible for coordination of driver and firmware
		link framing mode, changing this setting to 'Y' if the
		firmware is configured for 'raw-ip' mode.

KernelVersion:	4.11
Contact:	Bjørn Mork <bjorn@mork.no>
Description:
		Unsigned integer.

		Write a number ranging from 1 to 254 to add a qmap mux

		modems.

		The network device will be called qmimux.

		Userspace is in charge of managing the qmux network device
		activation and data stream setup on the modem side by
		using the proper QMI protocol requests.
