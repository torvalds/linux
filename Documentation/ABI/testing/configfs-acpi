What:		/config/acpi/table
Date:		July 2016
KernelVersion:	4.8
Description:

		This group contains the configuration for user defined ACPI
		tables. The attributes of a user define table are:

		aml 		- a binary attribute that the user can use to
				fill in the ACPI aml definitions. Once the aml
				data is written to this file and the file is
				closed the table will be loaded and ACPI devices
				will be enumerated. To check if the operation is
				successful the user must check the error code
				for close(). If the operation is successful,
				subsequent writes to this attribute will fail.

		The rest of the attributes are read-only and are valid only
		after the table has been loaded by filling the aml entry:

		signature 	- ASCII table signature
		length 		- length of table in bytes, including the header
		revision 	- ACPI Specification minor version number
		oem_id 		- ASCII OEM identification
		oem_table_id 	- ASCII OEM table identification
		oem_revision 	- OEM revision number
		asl_compiler_id - ASCII ASL compiler vendor ID
		asl_compiler_revision - ASL compiler version
