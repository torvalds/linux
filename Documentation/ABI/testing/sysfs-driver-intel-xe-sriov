Description:
		This directory appears for the particular Intel Xe device when:

		 - device supports SR-IOV, and
		 - device is a Physical Function (PF), and
		 - driver support for the SR-IOV PF is enabled on given device.

		This directory is used as a root for all attributes required to
		manage both Physical Function (PF) and Virtual Functions (VFs).

Description:
		This directory holds attributes related to the SR-IOV Physical
		Function (PF).

Description:
		These directories hold attributes related to the SR-IOV Virtual
		Functions (VFs).

		Note that the VF number <N> is 1-based as described in PCI SR-IOV
		specification as the Xe driver follows that naming schema.

		There could be "vf1", "vf2" and so on, up to "vf<N>", where <N>
		matches the value of the "sriov_totalvfs" attribute.

Description:
		These files expose scheduling parameters for the PF and its VFs, and
		are visible only on Intel Xe platforms that use time-sliced GPU sharing.
		They can be changed even if VFs are enabled and running and reflect the
		settings of all tiles/GTs assigned to the given function.

		exec_quantum_ms: (RW) unsigned integer
			The GT execution quantum (EQ) in [ms] for the given function.
			Actual quantum value might be aligned per HW/FW requirements.

			Default is 0 (unlimited).

		preempt_timeout_us: (RW) unsigned integer
			The GT preemption timeout in [us] of the given function.
			Actual timeout value might be aligned per HW/FW requirements.

			Default is 0 (unlimited).

		sched_priority: (RW/RO) string
			The GT scheduling priority of the given function.

			"low" - function will be scheduled on the GPU for its EQ/PT
				only if function has any work already submitted.

			"normal" - functions will be scheduled on the GPU for its EQ/PT
				irrespective of whether it has submitted a work or not.

			"high" - function will be scheduled on the GPU for its EQ/PT
				in the next time-slice after the current one completes
				and function has a work submitted.

			Default is "low".

			When read, this file will display the current and available
			scheduling priorities. The currently active priority level will
			be enclosed in square brackets, like:

				[low] normal high

			This file can be read-only if changing the priority is not
			supported.

		Writes to these attributes may fail with errors like:
			-EINVAL if provided input is malformed or not recognized,
			-EPERM if change is not applicable on given HW/FW,
			-EIO if FW refuses to change the provisioning.

		Reads from these attributes may fail with:
			-EUCLEAN if value is not consistent across all tiles/GTs.

Description:
		These files allows bulk reconfiguration of the scheduling parameters
		of the PF or VFs and are available only for Intel Xe platforms with
		GPU sharing based on the time-slice basis. These scheduling parameters
		can be changed even if VFs are enabled and running.

		exec_quantum_ms: (WO) unsigned integer
			The GT execution quantum (EQ) in [ms] to be applied to all functions.
			See sriov_admin/{pf,vf<N>}/profile/exec_quantum_ms for more details.

		preempt_timeout_us: (WO) unsigned integer
			The GT preemption timeout (PT) in [us] to be applied to all functions.
			See sriov_admin/{pf,vf<N>}/profile/preempt_timeout_us for more details.

		sched_priority: (WO) string
			The GT scheduling priority to be applied for all functions.
			See sriov_admin/{pf,vf<N>}/profile/sched_priority for more details.

		Writes to these attributes may fail with errors like:
			-EINVAL if provided input is malformed or not recognized,
			-EPERM if change is not applicable on given HW/FW,
			-EIO if FW refuses to change the provisioning.

Description:
		This file allows to control scheduling of the VF on the Intel Xe GPU
		platforms. It allows to implement custom policy mechanism in case VFs
		are misbehaving or triggering adverse events above defined thresholds.

		stop: (WO) bool
			All GT executions of given function shall be immediately stopped.
			To allow scheduling this VF again, the VF FLR must be triggered.

		Writes to this attribute may fail with errors like:
			-EINVAL if provided input is malformed or not recognized,
			-EPERM if change is not applicable on given HW/FW,
			-EIO if FW refuses to change the scheduling.
