What:		/sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
Date:		June 2022
KernelVersion:	6.0
Contact:	qat-linux@intel.com
Description:	(RW) Reports the current state of the QAT device. Write to
		the file to start or stop the device.

		The values are:

		* up: the device is up and running
		* down: the device is down


		It is possible to transition the device from up to down only
		if the device is up and vice versa.

		This attribute is only available for qat_4xxx devices.

What:		/sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/cfg_services
Date:		June 2022
KernelVersion:	6.0
Contact:	qat-linux@intel.com
Description:	(RW) Reports the current configuration of the QAT device.
		Write to the file to change the configured services.

		The values are:

		* sym;asym: the device is configured for running crypto
		  services
		* asym;sym: identical to sym;asym
		* dc: the device is configured for running compression services
		* dcc: identical to dc but enables the dc chaining feature,
		  hash then compression. If this is not required chose dc
		* sym: the device is configured for running symmetric crypto
		  services
		* asym: the device is configured for running asymmetric crypto
		  services
		* asym;dc: the device is configured for running asymmetric
		  crypto services and compression services
		* dc;asym: identical to asym;dc
		* sym;dc: the device is configured for running symmetric crypto
		  services and compression services
		* dc;sym: identical to sym;dc

		It is possible to set the configuration only if the device
		is in the `down` state (see /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state)

		The following example shows how to change the configuration of
		a device configured for running crypto services in order to
		run data compression::

			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			up
			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/cfg_services
			sym;asym
			# echo down > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			# echo dc > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/cfg_services
			# echo up > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/cfg_services
			dc

		This attribute is only available for qat_4xxx devices.

What:		/sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/pm_idle_enabled
Date:		June 2023
KernelVersion:	6.5
Contact:	qat-linux@intel.com
Description:	(RW) This configuration option provides a way to force the device into remaining in
		the MAX power state.
		If idle support is enabled the device will transition to the `MIN` power state when
		idle, otherwise will stay in the MAX power state.
		Write to the file to enable or disable idle support.

		The values are:

		* 0: idle support is disabled
		* 1: idle support is enabled

		Default value is 1.

		It is possible to set the pm_idle_enabled value only if the device
		is in the `down` state (see /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state)

		The following example shows how to change the pm_idle_enabled of
		a device::

			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			up
			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/pm_idle_enabled
			1
			# echo down > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			# echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/pm_idle_enabled
			# echo up > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/pm_idle_enabled
			0

		This attribute is only available for qat_4xxx devices.

What:		/sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/rp2srv
Date:		January 2024
KernelVersion:	6.7
Contact:	qat-linux@intel.com
Description:
		(RW) This attribute provides a way for a user to query a
		specific ring pair for the type of service that it is currently
		configured for.

		When written to, the value is cached and used to perform the
		read operation. Allowed values are in the range 0 to N-1, where
		N is the max number of ring pairs supported by a device. This
		can be queried using the attribute qat/num_rps.

		A read returns the service associated to the ring pair queried.

		The values are:

		* dc: the ring pair is configured for running compression services
		* sym: the ring pair is configured for running symmetric crypto
		  services
		* asym: the ring pair is configured for running asymmetric crypto
		  services

		Example usage::

			# echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/rp2srv
			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/rp2srv
			sym

		This attribute is only available for qat_4xxx devices.

Description:
		(RO) Returns the number of ring pairs that a single device has.

		Example usage::

			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/num_rps

What:		/sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/auto_reset
Date:		March 2024
KernelVersion:	6.8
Contact:	qat-linux@intel.com
Description:	(RW) Reports the current state of the autoreset feature
		for a QAT device

		Write to the attribute to enable or disable device auto reset.

		Device auto reset is disabled by default.

		The values are::

		* 1/Yy/on: auto reset enabled. If the device encounters an
		  unrecoverable error, it will be reset automatically.
		* 0/Nn/off: auto reset disabled. If the device encounters an
		  unrecoverable error, it will not be reset.

		This attribute is only available for qat_4xxx devices.
