Description:	(RW) Reports the current configuration of the QAT device.
		Write to the file to change the configured services.

		The values are:

		* sym;asym: the device is configured for running crypto
		  services
		* dc: the device is configured for running compression services

		It is possible to set the configuration only if the device
		is in the `down` state (see /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state)

		The following example shows how to change the configuration of
		a device configured for running crypto services in order to
		run data compression::

			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			up
			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/cfg_services
			sym;asym
			# echo down > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			# echo dc > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/cfg_services
			# echo up > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/cfg_services
			dc

		This attribute is only available for qat_4xxx devices.
