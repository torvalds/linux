Description:
		The "cells" folder contains one file per cell exposed by the
		NVMEM device. The name of the file is: <name>@<where>, with
		<name> being the cell name and <where> its location in the NVMEM
		device, in hexadecimal (without the '0x' prefix, to mimic device
		tree node names). The length of the file is the size of the cell
		(when known). The content of the file is the binary content of
		the cell (may sometimes be ASCII, likely without trailing
		character).
		Note: This file is only present if CONFIG_NVMEM_SYSFS
		is enabled.

		Example::

		  hexdump -C /sys/bus/nvmem/devices/1-00563/cells/product-name@d
		  00000000  54 4e 34 38 4d 2d 50 2d  44 4e         |TN48M-P-DN|
		  0000000a
