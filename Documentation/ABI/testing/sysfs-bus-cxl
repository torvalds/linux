Date:		May, 2022
KernelVersion:	v6.0
Contact:	linux-cxl@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) When a CXL decoder is of devtype "cxl_decoder_endpoint" it
		translates from a host physical address range, to a device local
		address range. Device-local address ranges are further split
		into a 'ram' (volatile memory) range and 'pmem' (persistent
		memory) range. The 'mode' attribute emits one of 'ram', 'pmem',
		'mixed', or 'none'. The 'mixed' indication is for error cases
		when a decoder straddles the volatile/persistent partition
		boundary, and 'none' indicates the decoder is not actively
		decoding, or no DPA allocation policy has been set.

		'mode' can be written, when the decoder is in the 'disabled'
		state, with either 'ram' or 'pmem' to set the boundaries for the
		next allocation.

Date:		May, 2022
KernelVersion:	v6.0
Contact:	linux-cxl@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) When a CXL decoder is of devtype "cxl_decoder_endpoint" it
		translates from a host physical address range, to a device local
		address range. The range, base address plus length in bytes, of
		DPA allocated to this decoder is conveyed in these 2 attributes.
		Allocations can be mutated as long as the decoder is in the
		disabled state. A write to 'dpa_size' releases the previous DPA
		allocation and then attempts to allocate from the free capacity
		in the device partition referred to by 'decoderX.Y/mode'.
		Allocate and free requests can only be performed on the highest
		instance number disabled decoder with non-zero size. I.e.
		allocations are enforced to occur in increasing 'decoderX.Y/id'
		order and frees are enforced to occur in decreasing
		'decoderX.Y/id' order.

Description:
		(RW) Write a string in the form 'regionZ' to start the process
		of defining a new persistent, or volatile memory region
		(interleave-set) within the decode range bounded by root decoder

Contact:	linux-cxl@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) System physical address space to be consumed by the region.
		When written trigger the driver to allocate space out of the
		parent root decoder's address space. When read the size of the
		address space is reported and should match the span of the

		changed, only freed by writing 0. The kernel makes no guarantees
		that data is maintained over an address space freeing event, and

Description:

Description:
		(RW) Write an endpoint decoder object name to 'targetX' where X
		is the intended position of the endpoint device in the region
		interleave and N is the 'interleave_ways' setting for the
		region. ENXIO is returned if the write results in an impossible
		to map decode scenario, like the endpoint is unreachable at that
		position relative to the root decoder interleave. EBUSY is
		returned if the position in the region is already occupied, or
		if the region is not in a state to accept interleave
		configuration changes. EINVAL is returned if the object name is
		not an endpoint decoder. Once all positions have been
		successfully written a final validation for decode conflicts is
		performed before activating the region.

		state to the actively decoding in hardware state. The commit
		operation in addition to validating that the region is in proper
		configured state, validates that the decoders are being
		committed in spec mandated order (last committed decoder id +
		1), and checks that the hardware accepts the commit request.
		Reading this value indicates whether the region is committed or

		list consists of addresses that are poisoned, or would result
		in poison if accessed, and the source of the poison. This
