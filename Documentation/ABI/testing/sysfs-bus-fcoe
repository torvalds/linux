Contact:	Robert Love <robert.w.love@intel.com>, devel@open-fcoe.org
Description:	'FCoE Controller' instances on the fcoe bus
Attributes:

	fcf_dev_loss_tmo: Device loss timeout peroid (see below). Changing
			  this value will change the dev_loss_tmo for all
			  FCFs discovered by this controller.

	lesb_link_fail:   Link Error Status Block (LESB) link failure count.

	lesb_vlink_fail:  Link Error Status Block (LESB) virtual link
			  failure count.

	lesb_miss_fka:    Link Error Status Block (LESB) missed FCoE
			  Initialization Protocol (FIP) Keep-Alives (FKA).

	lesb_symb_err:    Link Error Status Block (LESB) symbolic error count.

	lesb_err_block:   Link Error Status Block (LESB) block error count.

	lesb_fcs_error:   Link Error Status Block (LESB) Fibre Channel
			  Serivces error count.

Date:		March 2012

Contact:	Robert Love <robert.w.love@intel.com>, devel@open-fcoe.org
Description:	'FCoE FCF' instances on the fcoe bus. A FCF is a Fibre Channel
		Forwarder, which is a FCoE switch that can accept FCoE
		(Ethernet) packets, unpack them, and forward the embedded
		Fibre Channel frames into a FC fabric. It can also take
		outbound FC frames and pack them in Ethernet packets to
		be sent to their destination on the Ethernet segment.
Attributes:

	fabric_name: Identifies the fabric that the FCF services.

	switch_name: Identifies the FCF.

	priority:    The switch's priority amongst other FCFs on the same
		     fabric.

	selected:    1 indicates that the switch has been selected for use;
		     0 indicates that the swich will not be used.

	fc_map:      The Fibre Channel MAP

	vfid:	     The Virtual Fabric ID

	mac:         The FCF's MAC address

	fka_peroid:  The FIP Keep-Alive peroid

	fabric_state: The internal kernel state
		      "Unknown" - Initialization value
		      "Disconnected" - No link to the FCF/fabric
		      "Connected" - Host is connected to the FCF
		      "Deleted" - FCF is being removed from the system

	dev_loss_tmo: The device loss timeout peroid for this FCF.

Notes: A device loss infrastructre similar to the FC Transport's
       is present in fcoe_sysfs. It is nice to have so that a
       link flapping adapter doesn't continually advance the count
       used to identify the discovered FCF. FCFs will exist in a
       "Disconnected" state until either the timer expires and the
       FCF becomes "Deleted" or the FCF is rediscovered and becomes
       "Connected."


Users: The first user of this interface will be the fcoeadm application,
       which is commonly packaged in the fcoe-utils package.
