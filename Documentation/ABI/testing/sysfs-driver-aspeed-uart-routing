Description:	Selects the RX source of the UARTx device.

		When read, each file shows the list of available options with currently
		selected option marked by brackets "[]". The list of available options
		depends on the selected file.

		e.g.
		cat /sys/bus/platform/drivers/aspeed-uart-routing/*.uart_routing/uart1
		[io1] io2 io3 io4 uart2 uart3 uart4 io6

		In this case, UART1 gets its input from IO1 (physical serial port 1).
