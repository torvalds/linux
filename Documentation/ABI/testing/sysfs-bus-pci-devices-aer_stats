PCIe Device AER statistics
==========================
These attributes show up under all the devices that are AER capable. These
statistical counters indicate the errors "as seen/reported by the device".
Note that this may mean that if an endpoint is causing problems, the AER
counters may increment at its link partner (e.g. root port) because the
errors may be "seen" / reported by the link partner and not the
problematic endpoint itself (which may report all counters as 0 as it never
saw any problems).

Description:	List of correctable errors seen and reported by this

		be reported using a single ERR_COR message, thus

============================
PCIe Rootport AER statistics
============================
These attributes show up under only the rootports (or root complex event
collectors) that are AER capable. These indicate the number of error messages as
"reported to" the rootport. Please note that the rootports also transmit
(internally) the ERR_* messages for errors seen by the internal rootport PCI
device, so these counters include them and are thus cumulative of all the error
messages on the PCI hierarchy originating at that root port.
