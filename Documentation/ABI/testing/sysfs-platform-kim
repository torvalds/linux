What:		/sys/devices/platform/kim/dev_name
Date:		January 2010
KernelVersion:	2.6.38
Contact:	"Pavan Savoy" <pavan_savoy@ti.com>
Description:
		Name of the UART device at which the WL128x chip
		is connected. example: "/dev/ttyS0".

		The device name flows down to architecture specific board
		initialization file from the SFI/ATAGS bootloader
		firmware. The name exposed is read from the user-space
		dameon and opens the device when install is requested.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/kim/baud_rate
Date:		January 2010
KernelVersion:	2.6.38
Contact:	"Pavan Savoy" <pavan_savoy@ti.com>
Description:
		The maximum reliable baud-rate the host can support.
		Different platforms tend to have different high-speed
		UART configurations, so the baud-rate needs to be set
		locally and also sent across to the WL128x via a HCI-VS
		command. The entry is read and made use by the user-space
		daemon when the ldisc install is requested.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/kim/flow_cntrl
Date:		January 2010
KernelVersion:	2.6.38
Contact:	"Pavan Savoy" <pavan_savoy@ti.com>
Description:
		The WL128x makes use of flow control mechanism, and this
		entry most often should be 1, the host's UART is required
		to have the capability of flow-control, or else this
		entry can be made use of for exceptions.

What:		/sys/devices/platform/kim/install
Date:		January 2010
KernelVersion:	2.6.38
Contact:	"Pavan Savoy" <pavan_savoy@ti.com>
Description:
		When one of the protocols Bluetooth, FM or GPS wants to make
		use of the shared UART transport, it registers to the shared
		transport driver, which will signal the user-space for opening,
		configuring baud and install line discipline via this sysfs
		entry. This entry would be polled upon by the user-space
		daemon managing the UART, and is notified about the change
		by the sysfs_notify. The value would be '1' when UART needs
		to be opened/ldisc installed, and would be '0' when UART
		is no more required and needs to be closed.
