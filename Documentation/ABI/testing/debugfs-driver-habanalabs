Description:    Sets the device address to be used for read or write through
                PCI bar, or the device VA of a host mapped memory to be read or
                written directly from the host. The latter option is allowed
                only when the IOMMU is disabled.
                The acceptable value is a string that starts with "0x"

Description:    Allows the root user to read or write directly through the
                device's PCI bar. Writing to this file generates a write
                transaction while reading from the file generates a read
                transaction. This custom interface is needed (instead of using
                the generic Linux user-space PCI mapping) because the DDR bar
                is very small compared to the DDR memory and only the driver can
                move the bar before and after the transaction.
                If the IOMMU is disabled, it also allows the root user to read
                or write from the host a device VA of a host mapped memory

Description:    Displays the hop values and physical address for a given ASID
                and virtual address. The user should write the ASID and VA into
                the file and then read the file to get the result.
                e.g. to display info about VA 0x1000 for ASID 1 you need to do:
                echo "1 0x1000" > /sys/kernel/debug/habanalabs/hl0/mmu
