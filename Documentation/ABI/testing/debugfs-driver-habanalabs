Contact:        ogabbay@kernel.org
Description:    Allows the root user to read or write directly through the
                device's PCI bar. Writing to this file generates a write
                transaction while reading from the file generates a read
                transaction. This custom interface is needed (instead of using
                the generic Linux user-space PCI mapping) because the DDR bar
                is very small compared to the DDR memory and only the driver can
                move the bar before and after the transaction.

                If the IOMMU is disabled, it also allows the root user to read
                or write from the host a device VA of a host mapped memory

Description:    Allows the root user to read or write 64 bit data directly
                through the device's PCI bar. Writing to this file generates a
                write transaction while reading from the file generates a read

Description:    Allows the root user to read from the device's internal
                memory (DRAM/SRAM) through a DMA engine.
                This property is a binary blob that contains the result of the
                DMA transfer.
                This custom interface is needed (instead of using the generic
                Linux user-space PCI mapping) because the amount of internal
                memory is huge (>32GB) and reading it via the PCI bar will take
                a very long time.
                This interface doesn't support concurrency in the same device.
                In GAUDI and GOYA, this action can cause undefined behavior
                in case the it is done while the device is executing user
                workloads.
                Only supported on GAUDI at this stage.
