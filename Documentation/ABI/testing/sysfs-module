Description:	Maximum time allowed for periodic transfers per microframe (μs)

		[ USB 2.0 sets maximum allowed time for periodic transfers per
		  microframe to be 80%, that is 100 microseconds out of 125
		  microseconds (full microframe).

		  However there are cases, when 80% max isochronous bandwidth is
		  too limiting. For example two video streams could require 110
		  microseconds of isochronous bandwidth per microframe to work
		  together. ]

		Through this setting it is possible to raise the limit so that
		the host controller would allow allocating more than 100
		microseconds of periodic bandwidth per microframe.

		Beware, non-standard modes are usually not thoroughly tested by
		hardware designers, and the hardware can malfunction when this
		setting differ from default 100.
