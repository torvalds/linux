Contact:        Marek Lindner <lindner_marek@yahoo.de>
Description:
                Indicates whether the batman protocol messages of the
                mesh <mesh_iface> shall be aggregated or not.

Date:           June 2010
Contact:        Simon Wunderlich <siwu@hrz.tu-chemnitz.de>
Description:
                Indicates whether the data traffic going through the
                mesh will be sent using multiple interfaces at the
                same time (if available).

Date:           October 2010
Contact:        Andreas Langer <an.langer@gmx.de>
Description:
                Indicates whether the data traffic going through the
                mesh will be fragmented or silently discarded if the
                packet size exceeds the outgoing interface MTU.

What:		/sys/class/net/<mesh_iface>/mesh/ap_isolation
Date:		May 2011
Contact:	Antonio Quartulli <ordex@autistici.org>
Description:
		Indicates whether the data traffic going from a

Date:           October 2010
Contact:        Marek Lindner <lindner_marek@yahoo.de>
Description:
                Defines the bandwidth which is propagated by this
                node if gw_mode was set to 'server'.

What:           /sys/class/net/<mesh_iface>/mesh/gw_mode
Date:           October 2010
Contact:        Marek Lindner <lindner_marek@yahoo.de>
Description:
                Defines the state of the gateway features. Can be
                either 'off', 'client' or 'server'.

What:           /sys/class/net/<mesh_iface>/mesh/gw_sel_class
Date:           October 2010
Contact:        Marek Lindner <lindner_marek@yahoo.de>
Description:
                Defines the selection criteria this node will use
                to choose a gateway if gw_mode was set to 'client'.

What:           /sys/class/net/<mesh_iface>/mesh/orig_interval
Date:           May 2010
Contact:        Marek Lindner <lindner_marek@yahoo.de>
Description:
                Defines the interval in milliseconds in which batman
                sends its protocol messages.

What:           /sys/class/net/<mesh_iface>/mesh/hop_penalty
Date:           Oct 2010
Contact:        Linus Lüssing <linus.luessing@web.de>
Description:
		Defines the penalty which will be applied to an
		originator message's tq-field on every hop.

What:           /sys/class/net/<mesh_iface>/mesh/vis_mode
Date:           May 2010
Contact:        Marek Lindner <lindner_marek@yahoo.de>
Description:
                Each batman node only maintains information about its
                own local neighborhood, therefore generating graphs
                showing the topology of the entire mesh is not easily
                feasible without having a central instance to collect
                the local topologies from all nodes. This file allows
                to activate the collecting (server) mode.
