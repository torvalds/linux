		kernel_max: the maximum cpu index allowed by the kernel
		configuration.

		offline: cpus that are not online because they have been
		HOTPLUGGED off or exceed the limit of cpus allowed by the
		kernel configuration (kernel_max above).

		online: cpus that are online and being scheduled.

		possible: cpus that have been allocated resources and can be
		brought online if they are present.

		present: cpus that have been identified as being present in
		the system.

		See Documentation/cputopology.txt for more information.

		to other cores and threads in the same physical package.

		One cpu# directory is created per logical CPU in the system,
		e.g. /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu42/.

		Briefly, the files above are:

		core_id: the CPU core ID of cpu#. Typically it is the
		hardware platform's identifier (rather than the kernel's).
		The actual value is architecture and platform dependent.

		core_siblings: internal kernel map of cpu#'s hardware threads
		within the same physical_package_id.

		core_siblings_list: human-readable list of the logical CPU
		numbers within the same physical_package_id as cpu#.

		physical_package_id: physical package id of cpu#. Typically
		corresponds to a physical socket number, but the actual value
		is architecture and platform dependent.

		thread_siblings: internel kernel map of cpu#'s hardware
		threads within the same core as cpu#

		thread_siblings_list: human-readable list of cpu#'s hardware
		threads within the same core as cpu#

		Clock scaling allows you to change the clock speed of the
		CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save battery
		power, because the lower the clock speed, the less power
		the CPU consumes.

		There are many knobs to tweak in this directory.

		See files in Documentation/cpu-freq/ for more information.

		freqdomain_cpus is the list of CPUs (online+offline) that share
		the same clock/freq domain (possibly at the hardware level).
		That information may be hidden from the cpufreq core and the
		value of related_cpus may be different from freqdomain_cpus. This
		attribute is useful for user space DVFS controllers to get better
		power/performance results for platforms using acpi-cpufreq.

		This file is only present if the acpi-cpufreq driver is in use.

Contact:	Linux kernel mailing list <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>
Description:	Disable L3 cache indices

		These files exist in every CPU's cache/index3 directory. Each
		cache_disable_{0,1} file corresponds to one disable slot which
		can be used to disable a cache index. Reading from these files
		on a processor with this functionality will return the currently
		disabled index for that node. There is one L3 structure per
		node, or per internal node on MCM machines. Writing a valid
		index to one of these files will cause the specificed cache
		index to be disabled.

		All AMD processors with L3 caches provide this functionality.
		For details, see BKDGs at

		The id provides a unique number for a specific instance of

		assign them ids 0, 1, 2, ...

		Note that id value can be non-contiguous. E.g. level 1
		caches typically exist per core, but there may not be a
		power of two cores on a socket, so these caches may be
		numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, ...

		'cpuX/cpufreq/throttle_stats' directory contains the CPU frequency
		throttle stat attributes for the chip. The throttle stats of a cpu
		is common across all the cpus belonging to a chip. Below are the
		throttle attributes exported in the 'throttle_stats' directory:

		- turbo_stat : This file gives the total number of times the max
		frequency is throttled to lower frequency in turbo (at and above
		nominal frequency) range of frequencies.

		- sub_turbo_stat : This file gives the total number of times the
		max frequency is throttled to lower frequency in sub-turbo(below
		nominal frequency) range of frequencies.

		- unthrottle : This file gives the total number of times the max
		frequency is unthrottled after being throttled.

		- powercap : This file gives the total number of times the max
		frequency is throttled due to 'Power Capping'.

		- overtemp : This file gives the total number of times the max
		frequency is throttled due to 'CPU Over Temperature'.

		- supply_fault : This file gives the total number of times the
		max frequency is throttled due to 'Power Supply Failure'.

		- overcurrent : This file gives the total number of times the
		max frequency is throttled due to 'Overcurrent'.

		- occ_reset : This file gives the total number of times the max
		frequency is throttled due to 'OCC Reset'.

		The sysfs attributes representing different throttle reasons like
		powercap, overtemp, supply_fault, overcurrent and occ_reset map to
		the reasons provided by OCC firmware for throttling the frequency.
