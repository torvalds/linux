		of a particular governor. In the ladder governor, for example,
		it is not coherent, i.e. if one is disabling a light state, then
		all deeper states are disabled as well, but the disable variable
		does not reflect it. Likewise, if one enables a deep state but a
		lighter state still is disabled, then this has no effect.

Description:	Disable L3 cache indices

		These files exist in every CPU's cache/index3 directory. Each
		cache_disable_{0,1} file corresponds to one disable slot which
		can be used to disable a cache index. Reading from these files
		on a processor with this functionality will return the currently
		disabled index for that node. There is one L3 structure per
		node, or per internal node on MCM machines. Writing a valid
		index to one of these files will cause the specificed cache
		index to be disabled.

		All AMD processors with L3 caches provide this functionality.

		nominal frequency) range of frequencies.

		- sub_turbo_stat : This file gives the total number of times the
		max frequency is throttled to lower frequency in sub-turbo(below
		nominal frequency) range of frequencies.

		- unthrottle : This file gives the total number of times the max
		frequency is unthrottled after being throttled.

		- powercap : This file gives the total number of times the max
		frequency is throttled due to 'Power Capping'.

		- overtemp : This file gives the total number of times the max
		frequency is throttled due to 'CPU Over Temperature'.

		- supply_fault : This file gives the total number of times the
		max frequency is throttled due to 'Power Supply Failure'.

		- overcurrent : This file gives the total number of times the
		max frequency is throttled due to 'Overcurrent'.

		- occ_reset : This file gives the total number of times the max
		frequency is throttled due to 'OCC Reset'.

		The sysfs attributes representing different throttle reasons like
		powercap, overtemp, supply_fault, overcurrent and occ_reset map to
		the reasons provided by OCC firmware for throttling the frequency.
