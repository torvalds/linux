Description:
		A collection of both global and individual CPU attributes

		Individual CPU attributes are contained in subdirectories
		named by the kernel's logical CPU number, e.g.:

		/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/

Description:	CPU topology files that describe kernel limits related to
		hotplug. Briefly:

		kernel_max: the maximum cpu index allowed by the kernel
		configuration.

		offline: cpus that are not online because they have been
		HOTPLUGGED off or exceed the limit of cpus allowed by the
		kernel configuration (kernel_max above).

		online: cpus that are online and being scheduled.

		possible: cpus that have been allocated resources and can be
		brought online if they are present.

		present: cpus that have been identified as being present in
		the system.

		See Documentation/cputopology.txt for more information.

Description:	Dynamic addition and removal of CPU's.  This is not hotplug
		removal, this is meant complete removal/addition of the CPU
		from the system.

		probe: writes to this file will dynamically add a CPU to the
		system.  Information written to the file to add CPU's is
		architecture specific.

		release: writes to this file dynamically remove a CPU from
		the system.  Information writtento the file to remove CPU's
		is architecture specific.

Description:	Discover NUMA node a CPU belongs to

		When CONFIG_NUMA is enabled, a symbolic link that points
		to the corresponding NUMA node directory.

		For example, the following symlink is created for cpu42
		in NUMA node 2:

		/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu42/node2 -> ../../node/node2

Description:	CPU topology files that describe a logical CPU's relationship
		to other cores and threads in the same physical package.

		One cpu# directory is created per logical CPU in the system,
		e.g. /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu42/.

		Briefly, the files above are:

		core_id: the CPU core ID of cpu#. Typically it is the
		hardware platform's identifier (rather than the kernel's).
		The actual value is architecture and platform dependent.

		core_siblings: internal kernel map of cpu#'s hardware threads
		within the same physical_package_id.

		core_siblings_list: human-readable list of the logical CPU
		numbers within the same physical_package_id as cpu#.

		physical_package_id: physical package id of cpu#. Typically
		corresponds to a physical socket number, but the actual value
		is architecture and platform dependent.

		thread_siblings: internel kernel map of cpu#'s hardware
		threads within the same core as cpu#

		thread_siblings_list: human-readable list of cpu#'s hardware
		threads within the same core as cpu#

		See Documentation/cputopology.txt for more information.

Description:	Discover cpuidle policy and mechanism

		Various CPUs today support multiple idle levels that are
		differentiated by varying exit latencies and power
		consumption during idle.

		Idle policy (governor) is differentiated from idle mechanism
		(driver)

		current_driver: displays current idle mechanism

		current_governor_ro: displays current idle policy

		See files in Documentation/cpuidle/ for more information.

Description:	Discover and change clock speed of CPUs

		Clock scaling allows you to change the clock speed of the
		CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save battery
		power, because the lower the clock speed, the less power
		the CPU consumes.

		There are many knobs to tweak in this directory.

		See files in Documentation/cpu-freq/ for more information.

		In particular, read Documentation/cpu-freq/user-guide.txt
		to learn how to control the knobs.

Date:		August 2008
KernelVersion:	2.6.27
Contact:	discuss@x86-64.org
Description:	Disable L3 cache indices

		These files exist in every CPU's cache/index3 directory. Each
		cache_disable_{0,1} file corresponds to one disable slot which
		can be used to disable a cache index. Reading from these files
		on a processor with this functionality will return the currently
		disabled index for that node. There is one L3 structure per
		node, or per internal node on MCM machines. Writing a valid
		index to one of these files will cause the specificed cache
		index to be disabled.

		All AMD processors with L3 caches provide this functionality.
		For details, see BKDGs at

		Boosting allows the CPU and the firmware to run at a frequency
		beyound it's nominal limit.
