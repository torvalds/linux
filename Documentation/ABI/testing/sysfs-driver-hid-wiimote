Description:	While a device is initialized by the wiimote driver, we perform
		a device detection and signal a "change" uevent after it is
		done. This file shows the detected device type. "pending" means
		that the detection is still ongoing, "unknown" means, that the
		device couldn't be detected or loaded. "generic" means, that the
		device couldn't be detected but supports basic Wii Remote
		features and can be used.
		Other strings for each device-type are available and may be
		added if new device-specific detections are added.
		Currently supported are:
			gen10: First Wii Remote generation
			gen20: Second Wii Remote Plus generation (builtin MP)
			balanceboard: Wii Balance Board
