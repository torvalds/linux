What:		/sys/firmware/plpks/config
Date:		February 2023
Contact:	Nayna Jain <nayna@linux.ibm.com>
Description:	This optional directory contains read-only config attributes as
		defined by the PLPKS implementation. All data is in ASCII
		format.

What:		/sys/firmware/plpks/config/version
Date:		February 2023
Contact:	Nayna Jain <nayna@linux.ibm.com>
Description:	Config version as reported by the hypervisor in ASCII decimal
		format.

What:		/sys/firmware/plpks/config/max_object_size
Date:		February 2023
Contact:	Nayna Jain <nayna@linux.ibm.com>
Description:	Maximum allowed size of	objects in the keystore in bytes,
		represented in ASCII decimal format.

		This is not necessarily the same as the max size that can be
		written to an update file as writes can contain more than
		object data, you should use the size of the update file for
		that purpose.

What:		/sys/firmware/plpks/config/total_size
Date:		February 2023
Contact:	Nayna Jain <nayna@linux.ibm.com>
Description:	Total size of the PLPKS in bytes, represented in ASCII decimal
		format.

What:		/sys/firmware/plpks/config/used_space
Date:		February 2023
Contact:	Nayna Jain <nayna@linux.ibm.com>
Description:	Current space consumed by the key store, in bytes, represented
		in ASCII decimal format.

What:		/sys/firmware/plpks/config/supported_policies
Date:		February 2023
Contact:	Nayna Jain <nayna@linux.ibm.com>
Description:	Bitmask of supported policy flags by the hypervisor, represented
		as an 8 byte hexadecimal ASCII string. Consult the hypervisor
		documentation for what these flags are.

What:		/sys/firmware/plpks/config/signed_update_algorithms
Date:		February 2023
Contact:	Nayna Jain <nayna@linux.ibm.com>
Description:	Bitmask of flags indicating which algorithms the hypervisor
		supports for signed update of objects, represented as a 16 byte
		hexadecimal ASCII string. Consult the hypervisor documentation
		for what these flags mean.

What:		/sys/firmware/plpks/config/wrapping_features
Date:		November 2025
Contact:	Srish Srinivasan <ssrish@linux.ibm.com>
Description:	Bitmask of the wrapping features indicating the wrapping
		algorithms that are supported for the H_PKS_WRAP_OBJECT requests
		, represented as a 8 byte hexadecimal ASCII string. Consult the
		hypervisor documentation for what these flags mean.
