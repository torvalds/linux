What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptpN/clock_name
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file contains the name of the PTP hardware clock
		as a human readable string. The purpose of this
		attribute is to provide the user with a "friendly
		name" and to help distinguish PHY based devices from
		MAC based ones. The string does not necessarily have
		to be any kind of unique id.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptpN/pps_avaiable
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file indicates whether the PTP hardware clock
		supports a Pulse Per Second to the host CPU. Reading
		"1" means that the PPS is supported, while "0" means
		not supported.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptpN/extts_enable
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This write-only file enables or disables external
		timestamps. To enable external timestamps, write the
		channel index followed by a "1" into the file.
		To disable external timestamps, write the channel
		index followed by a "0" into the file.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptpN/fifo
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file provides timestamps on external events, in
		the form of three integers: channel index, seconds,
		and nanoseconds.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptpN/period
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This write-only file enables or disables periodic
		outputs. To enable a periodic output, write five
		integers into the file: channel index, start time
		seconds, start time nanoseconds, period seconds, and
		period nanoseconds. To disable a periodic output, set
		all the seconds and nanoseconds values to zero.

What:		/sys/class/ptp/ptpN/pps_enable
Date:		September 2010
Contact:	Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>
Description:
		This write-only file enables or disables delivery of
		PPS events to the Linux PPS subsystem. To enable PPS
		events, write a "1" into the file. To disable events,
		write a "0" into the file.
