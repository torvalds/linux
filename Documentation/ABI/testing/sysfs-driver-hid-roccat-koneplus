Date:		October 2010
Contact:	Stefan Achatz <erazor_de@users.sourceforge.net>
Description:	When read, this file returns the raw integer version number of the
		firmware reported by the mouse. Using the integer value eases
		further usage in other programs. To receive the real version
		number the decimal point has to be shifted 2 positions to the
		left. E.g. a returned value of 121 means 1.21
