Description:
		The /sys/class/hidraw/hidraw*/device/speed file controls
		reporting speed of Wacom bluetooth tablet. Reading from
		this file returns 1 if tablet reports in high speed mode
		or 0 otherwise. Writing to this file one of these values
		switches reporting speed.

Description:
		Attribute group for control of the status LEDs and the OLED
		displays found on the Wacom Intuos 4 M, L, and XL tablets. This
		attribute group is not available for other Wacom tablets.
		Therefore its presence implicitly signifies the presence of
		said LEDs and OLED displays on the tablet device.

Description:
		When writing a 1024 byte raw image in Wacom Intuos 4
		interleaving format to the file, the image shows up on Button N
		of the device. The image is a 64x32 pixel 4-bit gray image. The
		1024 byte binary is split up into 16x 64 byte chunks. Each 64
		byte chunk encodes the image data for two consecutive lines on
		the display. The low nibble of each byte contains the first
		line, and the high nibble contains the second line.
