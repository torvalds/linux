Date:		Nov 2015
KernelVersion:	4.4
Contact:	"Sinan Kaya <okaya@kernel.org>"
Description:
		Contains the platform specific cycle value to wait after a
		reset command is issued. If the value is chosen too short,
		then the HW will issue a reset failure interrupt. The value
		is platform specific and should not be changed without
		consultance.

Date:		Nov 2015
KernelVersion:	4.4
Contact:	"Sinan Kaya <okaya@kernel.org>"
Description:
		Contains a value between 0 and 31. Maximum number of
		read transactions that can be issued back to back.
		Choosing a higher number gives better performance but
		can also cause performance reduction to other peripherals
		sharing the same bus.
