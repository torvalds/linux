Description:
		This directory contains interface files for accessing Intel
		Software Defined Silicon (SDSi) features on a CPU. X
		represents the socket instance (though not the socket ID).
		The socket ID is determined by reading the registers file
		and decoding it per the specification.

		Some files communicate with SDSi hardware through a mailbox.
		Should the operation fail, one of the following error codes
		may be returned:

		==========	=====
		Error Code	Cause
		==========	=====
		EIO		General mailbox failure. Log may indicate cause.
		EBUSY		Mailbox is owned by another agent.
		EPERM		SDSI capability is not enabled in hardware.
		EPROTO		Failure in mailbox protocol detected by driver.
				See log for details.
		EOVERFLOW	For provision commands, the size of the data
				exceeds what may be written.
		ESPIPE		Seeking is not allowed.
		ETIMEDOUT	Failure to complete mailbox transaction in time.

Description:
		(WO) Used to write an Authentication Key Certificate (AKC) to
		the SDSi NVRAM for the CPU. The AKC is used to authenticate a
		Capability Activation Payload. Mailbox command.

KernelVersion:	5.18
Contact:	"David E. Box" <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>
Description:
		(WO) Used to write a Capability Activation Payload (CAP) to the
		SDSi NVRAM for the CPU. CAPs are used to activate a given CPU
		feature. A CAP is validated by SDSi hardware using a previously
		provisioned AKC file. Upon successful authentication, the CPU
		configuration is updated. A cold reboot is required to fully
		activate the feature. Mailbox command.

Description:
		(RO) Used to read back the current State Certificate for the CPU
		from SDSi hardware. The State Certificate contains information
		about the current licenses on the CPU. Mailbox command.
