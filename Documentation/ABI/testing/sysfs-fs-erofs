What:		/sys/fs/erofs/<disk>/sync_decompress
Date:		November 2021
Contact:	"Huang Jianan" <huangjianan@oppo.com>
Description:	Control strategy of synchronous decompression. Synchronous
		decompression tries to decompress in the reader thread for
		synchronous reads and small asynchronous reads (<= 12 KiB):

		- 0 (auto, default): apply to synchronous reads only, but will
		                     switch to 1 (force on) if any decompression
		                     request is detected in atomic contexts;
		- 1 (force on): apply to synchronous reads and small
		                asynchronous reads;
		- 2 (force off): disable synchronous decompression completely.

What:		/sys/fs/erofs/<disk>/drop_caches
Date:		November 2024
Contact:	"Guo Chunhai" <guochunhai@vivo.com>
Description:	Writing to this will drop compression-related caches,
		currently used to drop in-memory pclusters and cached
		compressed folios:

		- 1 : invalidate cached compressed folios
		- 2 : drop in-memory pclusters
		- 3 : drop in-memory pclusters and cached compressed folios
