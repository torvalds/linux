Description:
		Open-circuit fault. The detection of open-circuit faults,
		such as those caused by broken thermocouple wires.
		Reading returns either '1' or '0'.
		'1' = An open circuit such as broken thermocouple wires
		      has been detected.
		'0' = No open circuit or broken thermocouple wires are detected

Description:
		Overvoltage or Undervoltage Input Fault. The internal circuitry
		is protected from excessive voltages applied to the thermocouple
		cables by integrated MOSFETs at the T+ and T- inputs, and the
		BIAS output. These MOSFETs turn off when the input voltage is
		negative or greater than VDD.
		Reading returns either '1' or '0'.
		'1' = The input voltage is negative or greater than VDD.
		'0' = The input voltage is positive and less than VDD (normal
		state).
