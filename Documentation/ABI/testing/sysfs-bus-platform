What:		/sys/bus/platform/devices/.../driver_override
Date:		April 2014
Contact:	Kim Phillips <kim.phillips@freescale.com>
Description:
		This file allows the driver for a device to be specified which
		will override standard OF, ACPI, ID table, and name matching.
		When specified, only a driver with a name matching the value
		written to driver_override will have an opportunity to bind
		to the device.  The override is specified by writing a string
		to the driver_override file (echo vfio-platform > \
		driver_override) and may be cleared with an empty string
		(echo > driver_override).  This returns the device to standard
		matching rules binding.  Writing to driver_override does not
		automatically unbind the device from its current driver or make
		any attempt to automatically load the specified driver.  If no
		driver with a matching name is currently loaded in the kernel,
		the device will not bind to any driver.  This also allows
		devices to opt-out of driver binding using a driver_override
		name such as "none".  Only a single driver may be specified in
		the override, there is no support for parsing delimiters.

		source. Initial users for this file would be devices like
		arm smmu which are populated by arm64 acpi_iort.
