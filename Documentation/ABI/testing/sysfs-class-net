Date:		April 2005
KernelVersion:	2.6.12
Contact:	netdev@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Indicates the system-wide interface unique index identifier as a
		decimal number. This attribute is used for mapping an interface
		identifier to an interface name. It is used throughout the
		networking stack for specifying the interface specific
		requests/events.

		Indicates the system-wide interface unique index identifier a
		the interface is linked to. Format is decimal. This attribute is
		used to resolve interfaces chaining, linking and stacking.
		Physical interfaces have the same 'ifindex' and 'iflink' values.

Date:		March 2006
KernelVersion:	2.6.17
Contact:	netdev@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Indicates the interface link mode, as a decimal number. This
		attribute should be used in conjunction with 'dormant' attribute
		to determine the interface usability. Possible values:
		0: default link mode
		1: dormant link mode

		integer. Default value is 0 which corresponds to the initial
		network devices group. The group can be changed to affect
		routing decisions (see: net/ipv4/fib_rules and
		net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c).
