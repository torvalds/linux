Description:
		Stores channel Y frequency resolution/channel spacing in Hz.
		The value given directly influences the MODULUS used by
		the fractional-N PLL. It is assumed that the algorithm
		that is used to compute the various dividers, is able to
		generate proper values for multiples of channel spacing.

KernelVersion:	3.4.0
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Sets channel Y REFin frequency in Hz. In some clock chained
		applications, the reference frequency used by the PLL may
		change during runtime. This attribute allows the user to
		adjust the reference frequency accordingly.
		The value written has no effect until out_altvoltageY_frequency
		is updated. Consider to use out_altvoltageY_powerdown to power
		down the PLL and it's RFOut buffers during REFin changes.
