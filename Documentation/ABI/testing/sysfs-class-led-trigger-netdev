What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/device_name
Date:		Dec 2017
KernelVersion:	4.16
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Specifies the network device name to monitor.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/interval
Date:		Dec 2017
KernelVersion:	4.16
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Specifies the duration of the LED blink in milliseconds.
		Defaults to 50 ms.

		When offloaded is true, the interval value MUST be set to the
		default value and cannot be changed.
		Trying to set any value in this specific mode will return
		an EINVAL error.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/link
Date:		Dec 2017
KernelVersion:	4.16
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Signal the link state of the named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the LED's normal state is off.

		If set to 1, the LED's normal state reflects the link state
		of the named network device.
		Setting this value also immediately changes the LED state.


What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/tx
Date:		Dec 2017
KernelVersion:	4.16
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Signal transmission of data on the named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the LED will not blink on transmission.

		If set to 1, the LED will blink for the milliseconds specified
		in interval to signal transmission.

		When offloaded is true, the blink interval is controlled by
		hardware and won't reflect the value set in interval.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/rx
Date:		Dec 2017
KernelVersion:	4.16
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Signal reception of data on the named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the LED will not blink on reception.

		If set to 1, the LED will blink for the milliseconds specified
		in interval to signal reception.

		When offloaded is true, the blink interval is controlled by
		hardware and won't reflect the value set in interval.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/offloaded
Date:		Jun 2023
KernelVersion:	6.5
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Communicate whether the LED trigger modes are offloaded to
		hardware or whether software fallback is used.

		If 0, the LED is using software fallback to blink.

		If 1, the LED blinking in requested mode is offloaded to
		hardware.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/link_10
Date:		Jun 2023
KernelVersion:	6.5
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Signal the link speed state of 10Mbps of the named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the LED's normal state is off.

		If set to 1, the LED's normal state reflects the link state
		speed of 10MBps of the named network device.
		Setting this value also immediately changes the LED state.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/link_100
Date:		Jun 2023
KernelVersion:	6.5
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Signal the link speed state of 100Mbps of the named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the LED's normal state is off.

		If set to 1, the LED's normal state reflects the link state
		speed of 100Mbps of the named network device.
		Setting this value also immediately changes the LED state.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/link_1000
Date:		Jun 2023
KernelVersion:	6.5
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Signal the link speed state of 1000Mbps of the named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the LED's normal state is off.

		If set to 1, the LED's normal state reflects the link state
		speed of 1000Mbps of the named network device.
		Setting this value also immediately changes the LED state.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/link_2500
Date:		Nov 2023
KernelVersion:	6.8
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Signal the link speed state of 2500Mbps of the named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the LED's normal state is off.

		If set to 1, the LED's normal state reflects the link state
		speed of 2500Mbps of the named network device.
		Setting this value also immediately changes the LED state.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/link_5000
Date:		Nov 2023
KernelVersion:	6.8
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Signal the link speed state of 5000Mbps of the named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the LED's normal state is off.

		If set to 1, the LED's normal state reflects the link state
		speed of 5000Mbps of the named network device.
		Setting this value also immediately changes the LED state.

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/link_10000

What:		/sys/class/leds/<led>/half_duplex
Date:		Jun 2023
KernelVersion:	6.5
Contact:	linux-leds@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Signal the link half duplex state of the named network device.

		If set to 0 (default), the LED's normal state is off.

		If set to 1, the LED's normal state reflects the link half
		duplex state of the named network device.
