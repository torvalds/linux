                mode, the driver will set the maximum clock frequency to a high
                value when a user-space process opens the device's file (unless
                it was already opened by another process). The driver will set
                the max clock frequency to a low value when there are no user
                processes that are opened on the device's file. In "manual"
                mode, the user sets the maximum clock frequency by writing to
