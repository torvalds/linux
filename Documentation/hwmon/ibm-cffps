Kernel driver ibm-cffps
=======================

Supported chips:
  * IBM Common Form Factor power supply

Author: Eddie James <eajames@us.ibm.com>

Description
-----------

This driver supports IBM Common Form Factor (CFF) power supplies. This driver
is a client to the core PMBus driver.

Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not auto-detect devices. You will have to instantiate the
devices explicitly. Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices for
details.
