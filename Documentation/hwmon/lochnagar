Supported systems:
  * Cirrus Logic : Lochnagar 2

Author: Lucas A. Tanure Alves

Description
-----------

Lochnagar 2 features built-in Current Monitor circuitry that allows for the
measurement of both voltage and current on up to eight of the supply voltage
rails provided to the minicards. The Current Monitor does not require any
hardware modifications or external circuitry to operate.

The current and voltage measurements are obtained through the standard register
map interface to the Lochnagar board controller, and can therefore be monitored
by software.
