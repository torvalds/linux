Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Sensirion SHT3x-DIS chip, a humidity
and temperature sensor. Temperature is measured in degrees celsius, relative
humidity is expressed as a percentage. In the sysfs interface, all values are
scaled by 1000, i.e. the value for 31.5 degrees celsius is 31500.

The device communicates with the I2C protocol. Sensors can have the I2C
addresses 0x44 or 0x45, depending on the wiring. See
Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices for methods to instantiate the device.

There are two options configurable by means of sht3x_platform_data:
1. blocking (pull the I2C clock line down while performing the measurement) or
   non-blocking mode. Blocking mode will guarantee the fastest result but
   the I2C bus will be busy during that time. By default, non-blocking mode
   is used. Make sure clock-stretching works properly on your device if you
   want to use blocking mode.
2. high or low accuracy. High accuracy is used by default and using it is
   strongly recommended.

The sht3x sensor supports a single shot mode as well as 5 periodic measure
modes, which can be controlled with the update_interval sysfs interface.
The allowed update_interval in milliseconds are as follows:
  *     0   single shot mode
  *  2000   0.5 Hz periodic measurement
  *  1000   1   Hz periodic measurement
  *   500   2   Hz periodic measurement
  *   250   4   Hz periodic measurement
  *   100  10   Hz periodic measurement

In the periodic measure mode, the sensor automatically triggers a measurement
with the configured update interval on the chip. When a temperature or humidity
reading exceeds the configured limits, the alert attribute is set to 1 and
the alert pin on the sensor is set to high.
When the temperature and humidity readings move back between the hysteresis
values, the alert bit is set to 0 and the alert pin on the sensor is set to
low.

sysfs-Interface
---------------

temp1_input:        temperature input
humidity1_input:    humidity input
temp1_max:          temperature max value
temp1_max_hyst:     temperature hysteresis value for max limit
humidity1_max:      humidity max value
humidity1_max_hyst: humidity hysteresis value for max limit
temp1_min:          temperature min value
temp1_min_hyst:     temperature hysteresis value for min limit
humidity1_min:      humidity min value
humidity1_min_hyst: humidity hysteresis value for min limit
temp1_alarm:        alarm flag is set to 1 if the temperature is outside the
                    configured limits. Alarm only works in periodic measure mode
humidity1_alarm:    alarm flag is set to 1 if the humidity is outside the
                    configured limits. Alarm only works in periodic measure mode
heater_enable:      heater enable, heating element removes excess humidity from
                    sensor
                        0: turned off
                        1: turned on
update_interval:    update interval, 0 for single shot, interval in msec
                    for periodic measurement. If the interval is not supported
                    by the sensor, the next faster interval is chosen
