Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the National Semiconductor LM92
temperature sensor.

Each LM92 temperature sensor supports a single temperature sensor. There are
alarms for high, low, and critical thresholds. There's also an hysteresis to
control the thresholds for resetting alarms.

Support was added later for the LM76 and Maxim MAX6633/MAX6634/MAX6635,
which are mostly compatible. They have not all been tested, so you
may need to use the force parameter.
