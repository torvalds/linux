Description
-----------

The LTC4245 controller allows a board to be safely inserted and removed
from a live backplane in multiple supply systems such as CompactPCI and
PCI Express.


Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not probe for LTC4245 devices, due to the fact that some
of the possible addresses are unfriendly to probing. You will need to use
the "force" parameter to tell the driver where to find the device.

Example: the following will load the driver for an LTC4245 at address 0x23
on I2C bus #1:
$ modprobe ltc4245 force=1,0x23


Sysfs entries
-------------

The LTC4245 has built-in limits for over and under current warnings. This
makes it very likely that the reference circuit will be used.

This driver uses the values in the datasheet to change the register values
into the values specified in the sysfs-interface document. The current readings
rely on the sense resistors listed in Table 2: "Sense Resistor Values".
