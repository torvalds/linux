Description
-----------

The LTC4245 controller allows a board to be safely inserted and removed
from a live backplane in multiple supply systems such as CompactPCI and
PCI Express.


Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not probe for LTC4245 devices, due to the fact that some
of the possible addresses are unfriendly to probing. You will have to
instantiate the devices explicitly.

Example: the following will load the driver for an LTC4245 at address 0x23
on I2C bus #1:
$ modprobe ltc4245
$ echo ltc4245 0x23 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-1/new_device


Sysfs entries
-------------

The LTC4245 has built-in limits for over and under current warnings. This
makes it very likely that the reference circuit will be used.

This driver uses the values in the datasheet to change the register values
into the values specified in the sysfs-interface document. The current readings
rely on the sense resistors listed in Table 2: "Sense Resistor Values".

Note 1
------

If you have NOT configured the driver to sample all GPIO pins as analog
voltages, then the in10_input and in11_input sysfs attributes will not be
created. The driver will sample the GPIO pin that is currently connected to the
ADC as an analog voltage, and report the value in in9_input.

If you have configured the driver to sample all GPIO pins as analog voltages,
then they will be sampled in round-robin fashion. If userspace reads too
slowly, -EAGAIN will be returned when you read the sysfs attribute containing
the sensor reading.

The LTC4245 chip can be configured to sample all GPIO pins with two methods:
1) platform data -- see include/linux/i2c/ltc4245.h
2) OF device tree -- add the "ltc4245,use-extra-gpios" property to each chip

The default mode of operation is to sample a single GPIO pin.
