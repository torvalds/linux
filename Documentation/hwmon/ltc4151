Description
-----------

The LTC4151 is a High Voltage I2C Current and Voltage Monitor.


Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not probe for LTC4151 devices, since there is no register
which can be safely used to identify the chip. You will have to instantiate
the devices explicitly.

Example: the following will load the driver for an LTC4151 at address 0x6f
on I2C bus #0:
# modprobe ltc4151
# echo ltc4151 0x6f > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-0/new_device


Sysfs entries
-------------

Voltage readings provided by this driver are reported as obtained from the ADIN
and VIN registers.

Current reading provided by this driver is reported as obtained from the Current
Sense register. The reported value assumes that a 1 mOhm sense resistor is
installed.

in1_input		VDIN voltage (mV)

in2_input		ADIN voltage (mV)

curr1_input		SENSE current (mA)
