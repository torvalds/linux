Description
-----------

This driver implements support for Texas Instruments TMP401, TMP411,
TMP431, TMP432, TMP435, and TMP461 chips. These chips implement one or two
remote and one local temperature sensors. Temperature is measured in degrees
Celsius. Resolution of the remote sensor is 0.0625 degree. Local
sensor resolution can be set to 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 or 0.0625 degree (not
supported by the driver so far, so using the default resolution of 0.5
degree).

The driver provides the common sysfs-interface for temperatures (see
Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface under Temperatures).

The TMP411 and TMP431 chips are compatible with TMP401. TMP411 provides
some additional features.

* Minimum and Maximum temperature measured since power-on, chip-reset

  Exported via sysfs attributes tempX_lowest and tempX_highest.

* Reset of historical minimum/maximum temperature measurements

  Exported via sysfs attribute temp_reset_history. Writing 1 to this
  file triggers a reset.

TMP432 is compatible with TMP401 and TMP431. It supports two external
temperature sensors.

TMP461 is compatible with TMP401. It supports offset correction
that is applied to the remote sensor.

* Sensor offset values are temperature values

  Exported via sysfs attribute tempX_offset
