Description
-----------

The WM835x series of PMICs include an AUXADC which can be used to
monitor a range of system operating parameters, including the voltages
of the major supplies within the system.  Currently the driver provides
simple access to these major supplies.

Voltage Monitoring
------------------

Voltages are sampled by a 12 bit ADC.  For the internal supplies the ADC
is referenced to the system VRTC.
