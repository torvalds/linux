Description
-----------

The HIH-6130 & HIH-6131 are humidity and temperature sensors in a SO8 package.
The difference between the two devices is that the HIH-6131 has a condensation
filter.

The devices communicate with the I2C protocol. All sensors are set to the same
I2C address 0x27 by default, so an entry with I2C_BOARD_INFO("hih6130", 0x27)
can be used in the board setup code.

Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices for details on how to
instantiate I2C devices.
