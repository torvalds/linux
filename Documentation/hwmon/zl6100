Description
-----------

This driver supports hardware montoring for Intersil / Zilker Labs ZL6100 and
compatible digital DC-DC controllers.

The driver is a client driver to the core PMBus driver. Please see
Documentation/hwmon/pmbus and Documentation.hwmon/pmbus-core for details
on PMBus client drivers.


Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not auto-detect devices. You will have to instantiate the
devices explicitly. Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices for
details.

WARNING: Do not access chip registers using the i2cdump command, and do not use
any of the i2ctools commands on a command register used to save and restore
configuration data (0x11, 0x12, 0x15, 0x16, and 0xf4). The chips supported by
this driver interpret any access to those command registers (including read
commands) as request to execute the command in question. Unless write accesses
to those registers are protected, this may result in power loss, board resets,
and/or Flash corruption. Worst case, your board may turn into a brick.


Platform data support
---------------------

The driver supports standard PMBus driver platform data.


Module parameters
-----------------

delay
-----

Some Intersil/Zilker Labs DC-DC controllers require a minimum interval between
I2C bus accesses. According to Intersil, the minimum interval is 2 ms, though
1 ms appears to be sufficient and has not caused any problems in testing.
The problem is known to affect ZL6100, ZL2105, and ZL2008. It is known not to
affect ZL2004 and ZL6105. The driver automatically sets the interval to 1 ms
except for ZL2004 and ZL6105. To enable manual override, the driver provides a
writeable module parameter, 'delay', which can be used to set the interval to
a value between 0 and 65,535 microseconds.
