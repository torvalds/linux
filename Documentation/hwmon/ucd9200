Description
-----------

[From datasheets] UCD9220, UCD9222, UCD9224, UCD9240, UCD9244, UCD9246, and
UCD9248 are multi-rail, multi-phase synchronous buck digital PWM controllers
designed for non-isolated DC/DC power applications. The devices integrate
dedicated circuitry for DC/DC loop management with flash memory and a serial
interface to support configuration, monitoring and management.

This driver is a client driver to the core PMBus driver. Please see
Documentation/hwmon/pmbus for details on PMBus client drivers.


Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not auto-detect devices. You will have to instantiate the
devices explicitly. Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices for
details.


Platform data support
---------------------

The driver supports standard PMBus driver platform data. Please see
Documentation/hwmon/pmbus for details.


Sysfs entries
-------------

The following attributes are supported. Limits are read-write; all other
attributes are read-only.

in1_label		"vin".
in1_input		Measured voltage. From READ_VIN register.
in1_min			Minimum Voltage. From VIN_UV_WARN_LIMIT register.
in1_max			Maximum voltage. From VIN_OV_WARN_LIMIT register.
in1_lcrit		Critical minimum Voltage. VIN_UV_FAULT_LIMIT register.
in1_crit		Critical maximum voltage. From VIN_OV_FAULT_LIMIT register.
in1_min_alarm		Voltage low alarm. From VIN_UV_WARNING status.
in1_max_alarm		Voltage high alarm. From VIN_OV_WARNING status.
in1_lcrit_alarm		Voltage critical low alarm. From VIN_UV_FAULT status.
in1_crit_alarm		Voltage critical high alarm. From VIN_OV_FAULT status.

in[2-5]_label		"vout[1-4]".
in[2-5]_input		Measured voltage. From READ_VOUT register.
in[2-5]_min		Minimum Voltage. From VOUT_UV_WARN_LIMIT register.
in[2-5]_max		Maximum voltage. From VOUT_OV_WARN_LIMIT register.
in[2-5]_lcrit		Critical minimum Voltage. VOUT_UV_FAULT_LIMIT register.
in[2-5]_crit		Critical maximum voltage. From VOUT_OV_FAULT_LIMIT register.
in[2-5]_min_alarm	Voltage low alarm. From VOLTAGE_UV_WARNING status.
in[2-5]_max_alarm	Voltage high alarm. From VOLTAGE_OV_WARNING status.
in[2-5]_lcrit_alarm	Voltage critical low alarm. From VOLTAGE_UV_FAULT status.
in[2-5]_crit_alarm	Voltage critical high alarm. From VOLTAGE_OV_FAULT status.

curr1_label		"iin".
curr1_input		Measured current. From READ_IIN register.

curr[2-5]_label		"iout[1-4]".
curr[2-5]_input		Measured current. From READ_IOUT register.
curr[2-5]_max		Maximum current. From IOUT_OC_WARN_LIMIT register.
curr[2-5]_lcrit		Critical minimum output current. From IOUT_UC_FAULT_LIMIT
			register.
curr[2-5]_crit		Critical maximum current. From IOUT_OC_FAULT_LIMIT register.
curr[2-5]_max_alarm	Current high alarm. From IOUT_OC_WARNING status.
curr[2-5]_crit_alarm	Current critical high alarm. From IOUT_OC_FAULT status.

power1_input		Measured input power. From READ_PIN register.
power1_label		"pin"

power[2-5]_input	Measured output power. From READ_POUT register.
power[2-5]_label	"pout[1-4]"

			The number of output voltage, current, and power
			attribute sets is determined by the number of enabled
			rails. See chip datasheets for details.

temp[1-5]_input		Measured temperatures. From READ_TEMPERATURE_1 and
		        READ_TEMPERATURE_2 registers.
			temp1 is the chip internal temperature. temp[2-5] are
			rail temperatures.  temp[2-5] attributes are only
			created for enabled rails. See chip datasheets for
			details.
temp[1-5]_max		Maximum temperature. From OT_WARN_LIMIT register.
temp[1-5]_crit		Critical high temperature. From OT_FAULT_LIMIT register.
temp[1-5]_max_alarm	Temperature high alarm.
temp[1-5]_crit_alarm	Temperature critical high alarm.

fan1_input		Fan RPM. ucd9240 only.
fan1_alarm		Fan alarm. ucd9240 only.
fan1_fault		Fan fault. ucd9240 only.
