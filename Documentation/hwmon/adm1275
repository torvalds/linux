Description
-----------

This driver supports hardware montoring for Analog Devices ADM1275 Hot-Swap
Controller and Digital Power Monitor.

The ADM1275 is a hot-swap controller that allows a circuit board to be removed
from or inserted into a live backplane. It also features current and voltage
readback via an integrated 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), accessed
using a PMBus. interface.

The driver is a client driver to the core PMBus driver. Please see
Documentation/hwmon/pmbus for details on PMBus client drivers.


Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not auto-detect devices. You will have to instantiate the
devices explicitly. Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices for
details.


Platform data support
---------------------

The driver supports standard PMBus driver platform data. Please see
Documentation/hwmon/pmbus for details.
