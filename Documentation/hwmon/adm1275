Description
-----------

This driver supports hardware montoring for Analog Devices ADM1275 and ADM1276
Hot-Swap Controller and Digital Power Monitor.

ADM1275 and ADM1276 are hot-swap controllers that allow a circuit board to be
removed from or inserted into a live backplane. They also feature current and
voltage readback via an integrated 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC),
accessed using a PMBus interface.

The driver is a client driver to the core PMBus driver. Please see
Documentation/hwmon/pmbus for details on PMBus client drivers.


Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not auto-detect devices. You will have to instantiate the
devices explicitly. Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices for
details.


Platform data support
---------------------

The driver supports standard PMBus driver platform data. Please see
Documentation/hwmon/pmbus for details.


Sysfs entries
-------------

The following attributes are supported. Limits are read-write, history reset
attributes are write-only, all other attributes are read-only.

in1_label		"vin1" or "vout1" depending on chip variant and
			configuration.
in1_input		Measured voltage.
in1_min			Minumum Voltage.
in1_max			Maximum voltage.
in1_min_alarm		Voltage low alarm.
in1_max_alarm		Voltage high alarm.
in1_highest		Historical maximum voltage.
in1_reset_history	Write any value to reset history.

curr1_label		"iout1"
curr1_input		Measured current.
curr1_max		Maximum current.
curr1_max_alarm		Current high alarm.
curr1_lcrit		Critical minimum current. Depending on the chip
			configuration, either curr1_lcrit or curr1_crit is
			supported, but not both.
curr1_lcrit_alarm	Critical current low alarm.
curr1_crit		Critical maximum current. Depending on the chip
			configuration, either curr1_lcrit or curr1_crit is
			supported, but not both.
curr1_crit_alarm	Critical current high alarm.
curr1_highest		Historical maximum current.
curr1_reset_history	Write any value to reset history.
