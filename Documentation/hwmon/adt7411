Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Analog Devices ADT7411 chip. There may
be other chips that implement this interface.

The ADT7411 can use an I2C/SMBus compatible 2-wire interface or an
SPI-compatible 4-wire interface. It provides a 10-bit analog to digital
converter which measures 1 temperature, vdd and 8 input voltages. It has an
internal temperature sensor, but an external one can also be connected (one
loses 2 inputs then). There are high- and low-limit registers for all inputs.

Check the datasheet for details.

sysfs-Interface
---------------

in0_input	- vdd voltage input
in[1-8]_input	- analog 1-8 input
temp1_input	- temperature input

Besides standard interfaces, this driver adds (0 = off, 1 = on):

  adc_ref_vdd	- Use vdd as reference instead of 2.25 V
  fast_sampling	- Sample at 22.5 kHz instead of 1.4 kHz, but drop filters
  no_average	- Turn off averaging over 16 samples

Notes
-----

SPI, external temperature sensor and limit registers are not supported yet.
