Description
-----------

The LTC4215 controller allows a board to be safely inserted and removed
from a live backplane.


Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not probe for LTC4215 devices, due to the fact that some
of the possible addresses are unfriendly to probing. You will need to use
the "force" parameter to tell the driver where to find the device.

Example: the following will load the driver for an LTC4215 at address 0x44
on I2C bus #0:
$ modprobe ltc4215 force=0,0x44


Sysfs entries
-------------

The LTC4215 has built-in limits for overvoltage, undervoltage, and
undercurrent warnings. This makes it very likely that the reference
circuit will be used.

in1_input		input voltage
in2_input		output voltage

in1_min_alarm		input undervoltage alarm
in1_max_alarm		input overvoltage alarm

curr1_input		current
curr1_max_alarm		overcurrent alarm

power1_input		power usage
power1_alarm		power bad alarm
