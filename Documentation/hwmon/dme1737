Module Parameters
-----------------

* force_start: bool	Enables the monitoring of voltage, fan and temp inputs
			and PWM output control functions. Using this parameter
			shouldn't be required since the BIOS usually takes care
			of this.

Note that there is no need to use this parameter if the driver loads without
complaining. The driver will say so if it is necessary.


Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the hardware monitoring capabilities of the
SMSC DME1737 and Asus A8000 (which are the same) Super-I/O chips. This chip
features monitoring of 3 temp sensors temp[1-3] (2 remote diodes and 1
internal), 7 voltages in[0-6] (6 external and 1 internal) and 6 fan speeds
fan[1-6]. Additionally, the chip implements 5 PWM outputs pwm[1-3,5-6] for
controlling fan speeds both manually and automatically.

Fan[3-6] and pwm[3,5-6] are optional features and their availability is
dependent on the configuration of the chip. The driver will detect which
features are present during initialization and create the sysfs attributes
accordingly.


Voltage Monitoring
------------------

The voltage inputs are sampled with 12-bit resolution and have internal
scaling resistors. The values returned by the driver therefore reflect true
millivolts and don't need scaling. The voltage inputs are mapped as follows
(the last column indicates the input ranges):

	in0: +5VTR	(+5V standby)		0V - 6.64V
	in1: Vccp	(processor core)	0V - 3V
	in2: VCC	(internal +3.3V)	0V - 4.38V
	in3: +5V				0V - 6.64V
	in4: +12V				0V - 16V
	in5: VTR	(+3.3V standby)		0V - 4.38V
	in6: Vbat	(+3.0V)			0V - 4.38V

Each voltage input has associated min and max limits which trigger an alarm
when crossed.


Temperature Monitoring
----------------------

Temperatures are measured with 12-bit resolution and reported in millidegree
Celsius. The chip also features offsets for all 3 temperature inputs which -
when programmed - get added to the input readings. The chip does all the
scaling by itself and the driver therefore reports true temperatures that don't
need any user-space adjustments. The temperature inputs are mapped as follows
(the last column indicates the input ranges):

	temp1: Remote diode 1 (3904 type) temperature	-127C - +127C
	temp2: DME1737 internal temperature		-127C - +127C
	temp3: Remote diode 2 (3904 type) temperature	-127C - +127C

Each temperature input has associated min and max limits which trigger an alarm
when crossed. Additionally, each temperature input has a fault attribute that
returns 1 when a faulty diode or an unconnected input is detected and 0
otherwise.


Fan Monitoring
--------------

Fan RPMs are measured with 16-bit resolution. The chip provides inputs for 6
fan tachometers. All 6 inputs have an associated min limit which triggers an
alarm when crossed. Fan inputs 1-4 provide type attributes that need to be set
to the number of pulses per fan revolution that the connected tachometer
generates. Supported values are 1, 2, and 4. Fan inputs 5-6 only support fans
that generate 2 pulses per revolution. Fan inputs 5-6 also provide a max
attribute that needs to be set to the maximum attainable RPM (fan at 100% duty-
cycle) of the input. The chip adjusts the sampling rate based on this value.


PWM Output Control
------------------

This chip features 5 PWM outputs. PWM outputs 1-3 are associated with fan
inputs 1-3 and PWM outputs 5-6 are associated with fan inputs 5-6. PWM outputs
1-3 can be configured to operate either in manual or automatic mode by setting
the appropriate enable attribute accordingly. PWM outputs 5-6 can only operate
in manual mode, their enable attributes are therefore read-only. When set to
manual mode, the fan speed is set by writing the duty-cycle value to the
appropriate PWM attribute. In automatic mode, the PWM attribute returns the
current duty-cycle as set by the fan controller in the chip. All PWM outputs
support the setting of the output frequency via the freq attribute.

In automatic mode, the chip supports the setting of the PWM ramp rate which
defines how fast the PWM output is adjusting to changes of the associated
temperature input. Associating PWM outputs to temperature inputs is done via
temperature zones. The chip features 3 zones whose assignments to temperature
inputs is static and determined during initialization. These assignments can
be retrieved via the zone[1-3]_auto_channels_temp attributes. Each PWM output
is assigned to one (or hottest of multiple) temperature zone(s) through the
pwm[1-3]_auto_channels_zone attributes. Each PWM output has 3 distinct output
duty-cycles: full, low, and min. Full is internally hard-wired to 255 (100%)
and low and min can be programmed via pwm[1-3]_auto_point1_pwm and
pwm[1-3]_auto_pwm_min, respectively. The thermal thresholds of the zones are
programmed via zone[1-3]_auto_point[1-3]_temp and
zone[1-3]_auto_point1_temp_hyst:

	pwm[1-3]_auto_point2_pwm	full-speed duty-cycle (255, i.e., 100%)
	pwm[1-3]_auto_point1_pwm	low-speed duty-cycle
	pwm[1-3]_auto_pwm_min		min-speed duty-cycle

	zone[1-3]_auto_point3_temp	full-speed temp (all outputs)
	zone[1-3]_auto_point2_temp	full-speed temp
	zone[1-3]_auto_point1_temp	low-speed temp
	zone[1-3]_auto_point1_temp_hyst	min-speed temp

The chip adjusts the output duty-cycle linearly in the range of auto_point1_pwm
to auto_point2_pwm if the temperature of the associated zone is between
auto_point1_temp and auto_point2_temp. If the temperature drops below the
auto_point1_temp_hyst value, the output duty-cycle is set to the auto_pwm_min
value which only supports two values: 0 or auto_point1_pwm. That means that the
fan either turns completely off or keeps spinning with the low-speed
duty-cycle. If any of the temperatures rise above the auto_point3_temp value,
all PWM outputs are set to 100% duty-cycle.

Following is another representation of how the chip sets the output duty-cycle
based on the temperature of the associated thermal zone:

			Duty-Cycle	Duty-Cycle
	Temperature	Rising Temp	Falling Temp
	-----------	-----------	------------
	full-speed	full-speed	full-speed

			< linearly adjusted duty-cycle >

	low-speed	low-speed	low-speed
			min-speed	low-speed
	min-speed	min-speed	min-speed
			min-speed	min-speed
