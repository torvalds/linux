Description
-----------

This driver implements support for Texas Instruments TMP421, TMP422
and TMP423 temperature sensor chips. These chips implement one local
and up to one (TMP421), up to two (TMP422) or up to three (TMP423)
remote sensors. Temperature is measured in degrees Celsius. The chips
are wired over I2C/SMBus and specified over a temperature range of -40
to +125 degrees Celsius. Resolution for both the local and remote
channels is 0.0625 degree C.

The chips support only temperature measurement. The driver exports
the temperature values via the following sysfs files:

temp[1-4]_input
temp[2-4]_fault
