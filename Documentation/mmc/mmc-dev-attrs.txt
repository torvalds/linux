SD and MMC Block Device Attributes
==================================

These attributes are defined for the block devices associated with the
SD or MMC device.

The following attributes are read/write.

	force_ro		Enforce read-only access even if write protect switch is off.

SD and MMC Device Attributes
============================

All attributes are read-only.

	cid			Card Identifaction Register
	csd			Card Specific Data Register
	scr			SD Card Configuration Register (SD only)
	date			Manufacturing Date (from CID Register)
	fwrev			Firmware/Product Revision (from CID Register) (SD and MMCv1 only)
	hwrev			Hardware/Product Revision (from CID Register) (SD and MMCv1 only)
	manfid			Manufacturer ID (from CID Register)
	name			Product Name (from CID Register)
	oemid			OEM/Application ID (from CID Register)
	serial			Product Serial Number (from CID Register)
	erase_size		Erase group size
	preferred_erase_size	Preferred erase size

Note on Erase Size and Preferred Erase Size:

	"erase_size" is the  minimum size, in bytes, of an erase
	operation.  For MMC, "erase_size" is the erase group size
	reported by the card.  Note that "erase_size" does not apply
	to trim or secure trim operations where the minimum size is
	always one 512 byte sector.  For SD, "erase_size" is 512
	if the card is block-addressed, 0 otherwise.

	SD/MMC cards can erase an arbitrarily large area up to and
	including the whole card.  When erasing a large area it may
	be desirable to do it in smaller chunks for three reasons:
		1. A single erase command will make all other I/O on
		the card wait.  This is not a problem if the whole card
		is being erased, but erasing one partition will make
		I/O for another partition on the same card wait for the
		duration of the erase - which could be a several
		minutes.
		2. To be able to inform the user of erase progress.
		3. The erase timeout becomes too large to be very
		useful.  Because the erase timeout contains a margin
		which is multiplied by the size of the erase area,
		the value can end up being several minutes for large
		areas.

	"erase_size" is not the most efficient unit to erase
	(especially for SD where it is just one sector),
	hence "preferred_erase_size" provides a good chunk
	size for erasing large areas.

	For MMC, "preferred_erase_size" is the high-capacity
	erase size if a card specifies one, otherwise it is
	based on the capacity of the card.

	For SD, "preferred_erase_size" is the allocation unit
	size specified by the card.

	"preferred_erase_size" is in bytes.

SD/MMC/SDIO Clock Gating Attribute
==================================

Read and write access is provided to following attribute.
This attribute appears only if CONFIG_MMC_CLKGATE is enabled.

	clkgate_delay	Tune the clock gating delay with desired value in milliseconds.

echo <desired delay> > /sys/class/mmc_host/mmcX/clkgate_delay
