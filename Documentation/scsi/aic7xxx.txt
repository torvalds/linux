   1. No BIOS support
   2. DEC21050 PCI-PCI bridge with multiple controller chips on secondary bus
   3. DEC2115X PCI-PCI bridge with multiple controller chips on secondary bus
   4. All three SCSI connectors may be used simultaneously without
      SCSI "stub" effects.

2. Version History
   7.0	  (4th August, 2005)
	- Updated driver to use SCSI transport class infrastructure
	- Upported sequencer and core fixes from last adaptec released
	  version of the driver.
   6.2.36 (June 3rd, 2003)
        - Correct code that disables PCI parity error checking.
        - Correct and simplify handling of the ignore wide residue
          message.  The previous code would fail to report a residual
          if the transaction data length was even and we received
          an IWR message.
        - Add support for the 2.5.X EISA framework.
        - Update for change in 2.5.X SCSI proc FS interface.
        - Correct Domain Validation command-line option parsing.
        - When negotiation async via an 8bit WDTR message, send
          an SDTR with an offset of 0 to be sure the target
          knows we are async.  This works around a firmware defect
          in the Quantum Atlas 10K.
        - Clear PCI error state during driver attach so that we
          don't disable memory mapped I/O due to a stray write
          by some other driver probe that occurred before we
          claimed the controller.

   6.2.35 (May 14th, 2003)
        - Fix a few GCC 3.3 compiler warnings.
        - Correct operation on EISA Twin Channel controller.
        - Add support for 2.5.X's scsi_report_device_reset().

   6.2.34 (May 5th, 2003)
        - Fix locking regression introduced in 6.2.29 that
          could cause a lock order reversal between the io_request_lock
          and our per-softc lock.  This was only possible on RH9,
          SuSE, and kernel.org 2.4.X kernels.

   6.2.33 (April 30th, 2003)
        - Dynamically disable PCI parity error reporting after
          10 errors are reported to the user.  These errors are
          the result of some other device issuing PCI transactions
          with bad parity.  Once the user has been informed of the
          problem, continuing to report the errors just degrades
          our performance.

   6.2.32 (March 28th, 2003)
        - Dynamically sized S/G lists to avoid SCSI malloc
          pool fragmentation and SCSI mid-layer deadlock.

   6.2.28 (January 20th, 2003)
        - Domain Validation Fixes
        - Add ability to disable PCI parity error checking.
        - Enhanced Memory Mapped I/O probe

   6.2.20 (November 7th, 2002)
        - Added Domain Validation.

3. Command Line Options

        WARNING: ALTERING OR ADDING THESE DRIVER PARAMETERS
                 INCORRECTLY CAN RENDER YOUR SYSTEM INOPERABLE.
                 USE THEM WITH CAUTION. 

   Edit the file "modprobe.conf" in the directory /etc and add/edit a
   line containing 'options aic7xxx aic7xxx=[command[,command...]]' where
   'command' is one or more of the following:
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
              Option: verbose
          Definition: enable additional informative messages during
                      driver operation.
     Possible Values: This option is a flag
       Default Value: disabled
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
              Option: debug:[value]
          Definition: Enables various levels of debugging information
     Possible Values: 0x0000 = no debugging, 0xffff = full debugging
       Default Value: 0x0000
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
              Option: no_probe
              Option: probe_eisa_vl
          Definition: Do not probe for EISA/VLB controllers.
                      This is a toggle.  If the driver is compiled
                      to not probe EISA/VLB controllers by default,
                      specifying "no_probe" will enable this probing.
                      If the driver is compiled to probe EISA/VLB
                      controllers by default, specifying "no_probe"
                      will disable this probing.
     Possible Values: This option is a toggle
       Default Value: EISA/VLB probing is disabled by default.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
              Option: pci_parity
          Definition: Toggles the detection of PCI parity errors.
                      On many motherboards with VIA chipsets,
                      PCI parity is not generated correctly on the
                      PCI bus.  It is impossible for the hardware to
                      differentiate between these "spurious" parity
                      errors and real parity errors.  The symptom of
                      this problem is a stream of the message:
    "scsi0: Data Parity Error Detected during address or write data phase"
                      output by the driver.
     Possible Values: This option is a toggle
       Default Value: PCI Parity Error reporting is disabled
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
              Option: no_reset
          Definition: Do not reset the bus during the initial probe
                      phase
     Possible Values: This option is a flag
       Default Value: disabled
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
              Option: extended
          Definition: Force extended translation on the controller
     Possible Values: This option is a flag
       Default Value: disabled
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
              Option: periodic_otag
          Definition: Send an ordered tag periodically to prevent
                      tag starvation.  Needed for some older devices
     Possible Values: This option is a flag
       Default Value: disabled
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
              Option: reverse_scan
          Definition: Probe the scsi bus in reverse order, starting
                      with target 15
     Possible Values: This option is a flag
       Default Value: disabled
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
              Option: global_tag_depth:[value]
          Definition: Global tag depth for all targets on all busses.
                      This option sets the default tag depth which
                      may be selectively overridden vi the tag_info
                      option.
     Possible Values: 1 - 253
       Default Value: 32
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
              Option: tag_info:{{value[,value...]}[,{value[,value...]}...]}
          Definition: Set the per-target tagged queue depth on a
                      per controller basis.  Both controllers and targets
                      may be omitted indicating that they should retain
                      the default tag depth.
            Examples: tag_info:{{16,32,32,64,8,8,,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32}
                        On Controller 0
                          specifies a tag depth of 16 for target 0
                          specifies a tag depth of 64 for target 3
                          specifies a tag depth of 8 for targets 4 and 5
                          leaves target 6 at the default
                          specifies a tag depth of 32 for targets 1,2,7-15
                        All other targets retain the default depth.

                      tag_info:{{},{32,,32}}
                        On Controller 1
                          specifies a tag depth of 32 for targets 0 and 2
                        All other targets retain the default depth.
                        
     Possible Values: 1 - 253
       Default Value: 32
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
              Option: seltime:[value]
          Definition: Specifies the selection timeout value
     Possible Values: 0 = 256ms, 1 = 128ms, 2 = 64ms, 3 = 32ms
       Default Value: 0
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
              Option: dv: {value[,value...]} 
          Definition: Set Domain Validation Policy on a per-controller basis.
                      Controllers may be omitted indicating that
                      they should retain the default read streaming setting.
             Example: dv:{-1,0,,1,1,0}
                        On Controller 0 leave DV at its default setting.
                        On Controller 1 disable DV.
                        Skip configuration on Controller 2.
                        On Controllers 3 and 4 enable DV.
                        On Controller 5 disable DV.

     Possible Values: < 0 Use setting from serial EEPROM.
