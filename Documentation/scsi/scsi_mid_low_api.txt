                 SCSI mid_level - lower_level driver interface
                 =============================================

Introduction
============
This document outlines the interface between the Linux SCSI mid level and
SCSI lower level drivers. Lower level drivers (LLDs) are variously called 
host bus adapter (HBA) drivers and host drivers (HD). A "host" in this
context is a bridge between a computer IO bus (e.g. PCI or ISA) and a
single SCSI initiator port on a SCSI transport. An "initiator" port
(SCSI terminology, see SAM-3 at http://www.t10.org) sends SCSI commands
to "target" SCSI ports (e.g. disks). There can be many LLDs in a running
system, but only one per hardware type. Most LLDs can control one or more
SCSI HBAs. Some HBAs contain multiple hosts.

In some cases the SCSI transport is an external bus that already has
its own subsystem in Linux (e.g. USB and ieee1394). In such cases the
SCSI subsystem LLD is a software bridge to the other driver subsystem.
Examples are the usb-storage driver (found in the drivers/usb/storage
directory) and the ieee1394/sbp2 driver (found in the drivers/ieee1394
directory).

For example, the aic7xxx LLD controls Adaptec SCSI parallel interface
(SPI) controllers based on that company's 7xxx chip series. The aic7xxx
LLD can be built into the kernel or loaded as a module. There can only be
one aic7xxx LLD running in a Linux system but it may be controlling many 
HBAs. These HBAs might be either on PCI daughter-boards or built into 
the motherboard (or both). Some aic7xxx based HBAs are dual controllers
and thus represent two hosts. Like most modern HBAs, each aic7xxx host
has its own PCI device address. [The one-to-one correspondence between
a SCSI host and a PCI device is common but not required (e.g. with
ISA or MCA adapters).]

The SCSI mid level isolates an LLD from other layers such as the SCSI
upper layer drivers and the block layer.

This version of the document roughly matches linux kernel version 2.6.8 .

Documentation
=============
There is a SCSI documentation directory within the kernel source tree, 
typically Documentation/scsi . Most documents are in plain
(i.e. ASCII) text. This file is named scsi_mid_low_api.txt and can be 
found in that directory. A more recent copy of this document may be found
at http://www.torque.net/scsi/scsi_mid_low_api.txt.gz . 
Many LLDs are documented there (e.g. aic7xxx.txt). The SCSI mid-level is
briefly described in scsi.txt which contains a url to a document 
describing the SCSI subsystem in the lk 2.4 series. Two upper level 
drivers have documents in that directory: st.txt (SCSI tape driver) and 
scsi-generic.txt (for the sg driver).

Some documentation (or urls) for LLDs may be found in the C source code
or in the same directory as the C source code. For example to find a url
about the USB mass storage driver see the 
/usr/src/linux/drivers/usb/storage directory.

The Linux kernel source Documentation/DocBook/scsidrivers.tmpl file
refers to this file. With the appropriate DocBook tool-set, this permits
users to generate html, ps and pdf renderings of information within this
file (e.g. the interface functions).

Driver structure
================
Traditionally an LLD for the SCSI subsystem has been at least two files in
the drivers/scsi directory. For example, a driver called "xyz" has a header
file "xyz.h" and a source file "xyz.c". [Actually there is no good reason
why this couldn't all be in one file; the header file is superfluous.] Some
drivers that have been ported to several operating systems have more than
two files. For example the aic7xxx driver has separate files for generic 
and OS-specific code (e.g. FreeBSD and Linux). Such drivers tend to have
their own directory under the drivers/scsi directory.

When a new LLD is being added to Linux, the following files (found in the
drivers/scsi directory) will need some attention: Makefile and Kconfig .
It is probably best to study how existing LLDs are organized.

As the 2.5 series development kernels evolve into the 2.6 series
production series, changes are being introduced into this interface. An
example of this is driver initialization code where there are now 2 models
available. The older one, similar to what was found in the lk 2.4 series,
is based on hosts that are detected at HBA driver load time. This will be
referred to the "passive" initialization model. The newer model allows HBAs
to be hot plugged (and unplugged) during the lifetime of the LLD and will
be referred to as the "hotplug" initialization model. The newer model is
preferred as it can handle both traditional SCSI equipment that is
permanently connected as well as modern "SCSI" devices (e.g. USB or
IEEE 1394 connected digital cameras) that are hotplugged. Both 
initialization models are discussed in the following sections.

An LLD interfaces to the SCSI subsystem several ways:
  a) directly invoking functions supplied by the mid level
  b) passing a set of function pointers to a registration function
     supplied by the mid level. The mid level will then invoke these
     functions at some point in the future. The LLD will supply
     implementations of these functions.
  c) direct access to instances of well known data structures maintained
     by the mid level

Those functions in group a) are listed in a section entitled "Mid level
supplied functions" below.

Those functions in group b) are listed in a section entitled "Interface
functions" below. Their function pointers are placed in the members of
"struct scsi_host_template", an instance of which is passed to
scsi_host_alloc() ** .  Those interface functions that the LLD does not 
wish to supply should have NULL placed in the corresponding member of 
struct scsi_host_template.  Defining an instance of struct 
scsi_host_template at file scope will cause NULL to be  placed in function
 pointer members not explicitly initialized.

Those usages in group c) should be handled with care, especially in a
"hotplug" environment. LLDs should be aware of the lifetime of instances
that are shared with the mid level and other layers.

All functions defined within an LLD and all data defined at file scope
should be static. For example the slave_alloc() function in an LLD
called "xxx" could be defined as 
"static int xxx_slave_alloc(struct scsi_device * sdev) { /* code */ }"

** the scsi_host_alloc() function is a replacement for the rather vaguely
named scsi_register() function in most situations. The scsi_register()
and scsi_unregister() functions remain to support legacy LLDs that use
the passive initialization model.


Hotplug initialization model
============================
In this model an LLD controls when SCSI hosts are introduced and removed
from the SCSI subsystem. Hosts can be introduced as early as driver
initialization and removed as late as driver shutdown. Typically a driver
will respond to a sysfs probe() callback that indicates an HBA has been
detected. After confirming that the new device is one that the LLD wants
to control, the LLD will initialize the HBA and then register a new host
with the SCSI mid level.

During LLD initialization the driver should register itself with the
appropriate IO bus on which it expects to find HBA(s) (e.g. the PCI bus).
This can probably be done via sysfs. Any driver parameters (especially
those that are writable after the driver is loaded) could also be
registered with sysfs at this point. The SCSI mid level first becomes
aware of an LLD when that LLD registers its first HBA.

At some later time, the LLD becomes aware of an HBA and what follows
is a typical sequence of calls between the LLD and the mid level.
This example shows the mid level scanning the newly introduced HBA for 3 
scsi devices of which only the first 2 respond:

     HBA PROBE: assume 2 SCSI devices found in scan
LLD                   mid level                    LLD
===-------------------=========--------------------===------
scsi_host_alloc()  -->
scsi_add_host()  ---->
scsi_scan_host()  -------+
                         |
                    slave_alloc()
                    slave_configure() -->  scsi_adjust_queue_depth()
                         |
                    slave_alloc()
                    slave_configure()
                         |
                    slave_alloc()   ***
                    slave_destroy() ***
------------------------------------------------------------

If the LLD wants to adjust the default queue settings, it can invoke
scsi_adjust_queue_depth() in its slave_configure() routine.

*** For scsi devices that the mid level tries to scan but do not
    respond, a slave_alloc(), slave_destroy() pair is called.

When an HBA is being removed it could be as part of an orderly shutdown
associated with the LLD module being unloaded (e.g. with the "rmmod"
command) or in response to a "hot unplug" indicated by sysfs()'s
remove() callback being invoked. In either case, the sequence is the
same:

        HBA REMOVE: assume 2 SCSI devices attached
LLD                      mid level                 LLD
===----------------------=========-----------------===------
scsi_remove_host() ---------+
                            |
                     slave_destroy()
                     slave_destroy()
scsi_host_put()
------------------------------------------------------------
                     
It may be useful for a LLD to keep track of struct Scsi_Host instances
(a pointer is returned by scsi_host_alloc()). Such instances are "owned"
by the mid-level.  struct Scsi_Host instances are freed from
scsi_host_put() when the reference count hits zero.

Hot unplugging an HBA that controls a disk which is processing SCSI
commands on a mounted file system is an interesting situation. Reference
counting logic is being introduced into the mid level to cope with many
of the issues involved. See the section on reference counting below.


The hotplug concept may be extended to SCSI devices. Currently, when an
HBA is added, the scsi_scan_host() function causes a scan for SCSI devices
attached to the HBA's SCSI transport. On newer SCSI transports the HBA
may become aware of a new SCSI device _after_ the scan has completed.
An LLD can use this sequence to make the mid level aware of a SCSI device:

                 SCSI DEVICE hotplug
LLD                   mid level                    LLD
===-------------------=========--------------------===------
scsi_add_device()  ------+
                         |
                    slave_alloc()
                    slave_configure()   [--> scsi_adjust_queue_depth()]
------------------------------------------------------------

In a similar fashion, an LLD may become aware that a SCSI device has been
removed (unplugged) or the connection to it has been interrupted. Some
existing SCSI transports (e.g. SPI) may not become aware that a SCSI
device has been removed until a subsequent SCSI command fails which will
probably cause that device to be set offline by the mid level. An LLD that
detects the removal of a SCSI device can instigate its removal from
upper layers with this sequence:

                  SCSI DEVICE hot unplug
LLD                      mid level                 LLD
===----------------------=========-----------------===------
scsi_remove_device() -------+
                            |
                     slave_destroy()
------------------------------------------------------------

It may be useful for an LLD to keep track of struct scsi_device instances
(a pointer is passed as the parameter to slave_alloc() and
slave_configure() callbacks). Such instances are "owned" by the mid-level.
struct scsi_device instances are freed after slave_destroy().


Passive initialization model
============================
These older LLDs include a file called "scsi_module.c" [yes the ".c" is a
little surprising] in their source code. For that file to work an
instance of struct scsi_host_template with the name "driver_template"
needs to be defined. Here is a typical code sequence used in this model:
    static struct scsi_host_template driver_template = {
        ...
    };
    #include "scsi_module.c"

The scsi_module.c file contains two functions:
  - init_this_scsi_driver() which is executed when the LLD is
    initialized (i.e. boot time or module load time)
  - exit_this_scsi_driver() which is executed when the LLD is shut
    down (i.e. module unload time)
Note: since these functions are tagged with __init and __exit qualifiers
an LLD should not call them explicitly (since the kernel does that).

Here is an example of an initialization sequence when two hosts are
detected (so detect() returns 2) and the SCSI bus scan on each host
finds 1 SCSI device (and a second device does not respond).

LLD                      mid level                 LLD
===----------------------=========-----------------===------
init_this_scsi_driver() ----+
                            |
                         detect()  -----------------+
                            |                       |
                            |                scsi_register()
                            |                scsi_register()
                            |
                      slave_alloc()
                      slave_configure()  -->  scsi_adjust_queue_depth()
                      slave_alloc()   ***
                      slave_destroy() ***
                            |
                      slave_alloc()
                      slave_configure()
                      slave_alloc()   ***
                      slave_destroy() ***
------------------------------------------------------------

The mid level invokes scsi_adjust_queue_depth() with tagged queuing off and
"cmd_per_lun" for that host as the queue length. These settings can be
overridden by a slave_configure() supplied by the LLD.

*** For scsi devices that the mid level tries to scan but do not
    respond, a slave_alloc(), slave_destroy() pair is called.

Here is an LLD shutdown sequence:

LLD                      mid level                 LLD
===----------------------=========-----------------===------
exit_this_scsi_driver() ----+
                            |
                     slave_destroy()
                        release()   -->   scsi_unregister()
                            |
                     slave_destroy()
                        release()   -->   scsi_unregister()
------------------------------------------------------------

An LLD need not define slave_destroy() (i.e. it is optional). 

The shortcoming of the "passive initialization model" is that host
registration and de-registration are (typically) tied to LLD initialization
and shutdown. Once the LLD is initialized then a new host that appears
(e.g. via hotplugging) cannot easily be added without a redundant
driver shutdown and re-initialization. It may be possible to write an LLD
that uses both initialization models.


Reference Counting
==================
The Scsi_Host structure has had reference counting infrastructure added.
This effectively spreads the ownership of struct Scsi_Host instances
across the various SCSI layers which use them. Previously such instances
were exclusively owned by the mid level. LLDs would not usually need to
directly manipulate these reference counts but there may be some cases
where they do.

There are 3 reference counting functions of interest associated with
struct Scsi_Host:
  - scsi_host_alloc(): returns a pointer to new instance of struct 
        Scsi_Host which has its reference count ^^ set to 1
  - scsi_host_get(): adds 1 to the reference count of the given instance
  - scsi_host_put(): decrements 1 from the reference count of the given
        instance. If the reference count reaches 0 then the given instance
        is freed

The Scsi_device structure has had reference counting infrastructure added.
This effectively spreads the ownership of struct Scsi_device instances
across the various SCSI layers which use them. Previously such instances
were exclusively owned by the mid level. See the access functions declared
towards the end of include/scsi/scsi_device.h . If an LLD wants to keep
a copy of a pointer to a Scsi_device instance it should use scsi_device_get()
to bump its reference count. When it is finished with the pointer it can
use scsi_device_put() to decrement its reference count (and potentially
delete it).

^^ struct Scsi_Host actually has 2 reference counts which are manipulated
in parallel by these functions.


Conventions
===========
First, Linus Torvalds's thoughts on C coding style can be found in the
Documentation/CodingStyle file. 

Next, there is a movement to "outlaw" typedefs introducing synonyms for 
struct tags. Both can be still found in the SCSI subsystem, but
the typedefs have been moved to a single file, scsi_typedefs.h to
make their future removal easier, for example: 
"typedef struct scsi_cmnd Scsi_Cmnd;"

Also, most C99 enhancements are encouraged to the extent they are supported
by the relevant gcc compilers. So C99 style structure and array
initializers are encouraged where appropriate. Don't go too far,
VLAs are not properly supported yet.  An exception to this is the use of
"//" style comments; /*...*/ comments are still preferred in Linux.

Well written, tested and documented code, need not be re-formatted to
comply with the above conventions. For example, the aic7xxx driver
comes to Linux from FreeBSD and Adaptec's own labs. No doubt FreeBSD
and Adaptec have their own coding conventions.


Mid level supplied functions
============================
These functions are supplied by the SCSI mid level for use by LLDs.
The names (i.e. entry points) of these functions are exported 
so an LLD that is a module can access them. The kernel will
arrange for the SCSI mid level to be loaded and initialized before any LLD
is initialized. The functions below are listed alphabetically and their
names all start with "scsi_".

Interface Functions
===================
Interface functions are supplied (defined) by LLDs and their function
pointers are placed in an instance of struct scsi_host_template which
is passed to scsi_host_alloc() [or scsi_register() / init_this_scsi_driver()].
Some are mandatory. Interface functions should be declared static. The
accepted convention is that driver "xyz" will declare its slave_configure() 
function as:
    static int xyz_slave_configure(struct scsi_device * sdev);
and so forth for all interface functions listed below.

A pointer to this function should be placed in the 'slave_configure' member
of a "struct scsi_host_template" instance. A pointer to such an instance
should be passed to the mid level's scsi_host_alloc() [or scsi_register() /
init_this_scsi_driver()].

The interface functions are also described in the include/scsi/scsi_host.h
file immediately above their definition point in "struct scsi_host_template".
In some cases more detail is given in scsi_host.h than below.

The interface functions are listed below in alphabetical order.

Summary:
   bios_param - fetch head, sector, cylinder info for a disk
   detect - detects HBAs this driver wants to control
   eh_timed_out - notify the host that a command timer expired
   eh_abort_handler - abort given command
   eh_bus_reset_handler - issue SCSI bus reset
   eh_device_reset_handler - issue SCSI device reset
   eh_host_reset_handler - reset host (host bus adapter)
   info - supply information about given host
   ioctl - driver can respond to ioctls
   proc_info - supports /proc/scsi/{driver_name}/{host_no}
   queuecommand - queue scsi command, invoke 'done' on completion
   release - release all resources associated with given host
   slave_alloc - prior to any commands being sent to a new device 
   slave_configure - driver fine tuning for given device after attach
   slave_destroy - given device is about to be shut down

Data Structures
===============
struct scsi_host_template
-------------------------
There is one "struct scsi_host_template" instance per LLD ***. It is
typically initialized as a file scope static in a driver's header file. That
way members that are not explicitly initialized will be set to 0 or NULL.
Member of interest:
    name         - name of driver (may contain spaces, please limit to
                   less than 80 characters)
    proc_name    - name used in "/proc/scsi/<proc_name>/<host_no>" and
                   by sysfs in one of its "drivers" directories. Hence
                   "proc_name" should only contain characters acceptable
                   to a Unix file name.
   (*queuecommand)() - primary callback that the mid level uses to inject
                   SCSI commands into an LLD.
The structure is defined and commented in include/scsi/scsi_host.h

*** In extreme situations a single driver may have several instances
    if it controls several different classes of hardware (e.g. an LLD
    that handles both ISA and PCI cards and has a separate instance of
    struct scsi_host_template for each class).

struct Scsi_Host
----------------
There is one struct Scsi_Host instance per host (HBA) that an LLD
controls. The struct Scsi_Host structure has many members in common
with "struct scsi_host_template". When a new struct Scsi_Host instance
is created (in scsi_host_alloc() in hosts.c) those common members are
initialized from the driver's struct scsi_host_template instance. Members
of interest:
    host_no      - system wide unique number that is used for identifying
                   this host. Issued in ascending order from 0.
    can_queue    - must be greater than 0; do not send more than can_queue
                   commands to the adapter.
    this_id      - scsi id of host (scsi initiator) or -1 if not known
    sg_tablesize - maximum scatter gather elements allowed by host.
                   0 implies scatter gather not supported by host
    max_sectors  - maximum number of sectors (usually 512 bytes) allowed
                   in a single SCSI command. The default value of 0 leads
                   to a setting of SCSI_DEFAULT_MAX_SECTORS (defined in
                   scsi_host.h) which is currently set to 1024. So for a
                   disk the maximum transfer size is 512 KB when max_sectors
                   is not defined. Note that this size may not be sufficient
                   for disk firmware uploads.
    cmd_per_lun  - maximum number of commands that can be queued on devices
                   controlled by the host. Overridden by LLD calls to
                   scsi_adjust_queue_depth().
    unchecked_isa_dma - 1=>only use bottom 16 MB of ram (ISA DMA addressing
                   restriction), 0=>can use full 32 bit (or better) DMA
                   address space
    use_clustering - 1=>SCSI commands in mid level's queue can be merged,
                     0=>disallow SCSI command merging
    hostt        - pointer to driver's struct scsi_host_template from which
                   this struct Scsi_Host instance was spawned
    hostt->proc_name  - name of LLD. This is the driver name that sysfs uses
    transportt   - pointer to driver's struct scsi_transport_template instance
                   (if any). FC and SPI transports currently supported.
    sh_list      - a double linked list of pointers to all struct Scsi_Host
                   instances (currently ordered by ascending host_no)
    my_devices   - a double linked list of pointers to struct scsi_device 
                   instances that belong to this host.
    hostdata[0]  - area reserved for LLD at end of struct Scsi_Host. Size
                   is set by the second argument (named 'xtr_bytes') to
                   scsi_host_alloc() or scsi_register().
    vendor_id    - a unique value that identifies the vendor supplying
                   the LLD for the Scsi_Host.  Used most often in validating
                   vendor-specific message requests.  Value consists of an
                   identifier type and a vendor-specific value.
                   See scsi_netlink.h for a description of valid formats.

The scsi_host structure is defined in include/scsi/scsi_host.h

struct scsi_device
------------------
Generally, there is one instance of this structure for each SCSI logical unit
on a host. Scsi devices connected to a host are uniquely identified by a
channel number, target id and logical unit number (lun).
The structure is defined in include/scsi/scsi_device.h

struct scsi_cmnd
----------------
Instances of this structure convey SCSI commands to the LLD and responses
back to the mid level. The SCSI mid level will ensure that no more SCSI
commands become queued against the LLD than are indicated by
scsi_adjust_queue_depth() (or struct Scsi_Host::cmd_per_lun). There will
be at least one instance of struct scsi_cmnd available for each SCSI device.
Members of interest:
    cmnd         - array containing SCSI command
    cmnd_len     - length (in bytes) of SCSI command
    sc_data_direction - direction of data transfer in data phase. See
                "enum dma_data_direction" in include/linux/dma-mapping.h
    request_bufflen - number of data bytes to transfer (0 if no data phase)
    use_sg       - ==0 -> no scatter gather list, hence transfer data
                          to/from request_buffer
                 - >0 ->  scatter gather list (actually an array) in
                          request_buffer with use_sg elements
    request_buffer - either contains data buffer or scatter gather list
                     depending on the setting of use_sg. Scatter gather
                     elements are defined by 'struct scatterlist' found
                     in include/asm/scatterlist.h .
    done         - function pointer that should be invoked by LLD when the
                   SCSI command is completed (successfully or otherwise).
                   Should only be called by an LLD if the LLD has accepted
                   the command (i.e. queuecommand() returned or will return
                   0). The LLD may invoke 'done'  prior to queuecommand()
                   finishing.
    result       - should be set by LLD prior to calling 'done'. A value
                   of 0 implies a successfully completed command (and all
                   data (if any) has been transferred to or from the SCSI
                   target device). 'result' is a 32 bit unsigned integer that
                   can be viewed as 4 related bytes. The SCSI status value is
                   in the LSB. See include/scsi/scsi.h status_byte(),
                   msg_byte(), host_byte() and driver_byte() macros and
                   related constants.
    sense_buffer - an array (maximum size: SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE bytes) that
                   should be written when the SCSI status (LSB of 'result')
                   is set to CHECK_CONDITION (2). When CHECK_CONDITION is
                   set, if the top nibble of sense_buffer[0] has the value 7
                   then the mid level will assume the sense_buffer array
                   contains a valid SCSI sense buffer; otherwise the mid
                   level will issue a REQUEST_SENSE SCSI command to
                   retrieve the sense buffer. The latter strategy is error
                   prone in the presence of command queuing so the LLD should
                   always "auto-sense".
    device       - pointer to scsi_device object that this command is
                   associated with.
    resid        - an LLD should set this signed integer to the requested
                   transfer length (i.e. 'request_bufflen') less the number
                   of bytes that are actually transferred. 'resid' is
                   preset to 0 so an LLD can ignore it if it cannot detect
                   underruns (overruns should be rare). If possible an LLD
                   should set 'resid' prior to invoking 'done'. The most
                   interesting case is data transfers from a SCSI target
                   device device (i.e. READs) that underrun. 
    underflow    - LLD should place (DID_ERROR << 16) in 'result' if
                   actual number of bytes transferred is less than this
                   figure. Not many LLDs implement this check and some that
                   do just output an error message to the log rather than
                   report a DID_ERROR. Better for an LLD to implement
                   'resid'.

The scsi_cmnd structure is defined in include/scsi/scsi_cmnd.h


Locks
=====
Each struct Scsi_Host instance has a spin_lock called struct 
Scsi_Host::default_lock which is initialized in scsi_host_alloc() [found in 
hosts.c]. Within the same function the struct Scsi_Host::host_lock pointer
is initialized to point at default_lock.  Thereafter lock and unlock
operations performed by the mid level use the struct Scsi_Host::host_lock
pointer.  Previously drivers could override the host_lock pointer but
this is not allowed anymore.


Autosense
=========
Autosense (or auto-sense) is defined in the SAM-2 document as "the
automatic return of sense data to the application client coincident
with the completion of a SCSI command" when a status of CHECK CONDITION
occurs. LLDs should perform autosense. This should be done when the LLD
detects a CHECK CONDITION status by either: 
    a) instructing the SCSI protocol (e.g. SCSI Parallel Interface (SPI))
       to perform an extra data in phase on such responses
    b) or, the LLD issuing a REQUEST SENSE command itself

Either way, when a status of CHECK CONDITION is detected, the mid level
decides whether the LLD has performed autosense by checking struct 
scsi_cmnd::sense_buffer[0] . If this byte has an upper nibble of 7 (or 0xf)
then autosense is assumed to have taken place. If it has another value (and
this byte is initialized to 0 before each command) then the mid level will
issue a REQUEST SENSE command.

In the presence of queued commands the "nexus" that maintains sense
buffer data from the command that failed until a following REQUEST SENSE
may get out of synchronization. This is why it is best for the LLD
to perform autosense.


Changes since lk 2.4 series
===========================
io_request_lock has been replaced by several finer grained locks. The lock 
relevant to LLDs is struct Scsi_Host::host_lock and there is
one per SCSI host.

The older error handling mechanism has been removed. This means the
LLD interface functions abort() and reset() have been removed.
The struct scsi_host_template::use_new_eh_code flag has been removed.

In the 2.4 series the SCSI subsystem configuration descriptions were 
aggregated with the configuration descriptions from all other Linux 
subsystems in the Documentation/Configure.help file. In the 2.6 series, 
the SCSI subsystem now has its own (much smaller) drivers/scsi/Kconfig
file that contains both configuration and help information.

struct SHT has been renamed to struct scsi_host_template.

Addition of the "hotplug initialization model" and many extra functions
to support it.
