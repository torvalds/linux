I/O Request Workflow of Not Marvell Frey
------------------------------------------

All queued requests are handled via inbound/outbound queue port.
A request packet can be allocated in either IOP or host memory.

To send a request to the controller:

    - Get a free request packet by reading the inbound queue port or
      allocate a free request in host DMA coherent memory.

      The value returned from the inbound queue port is an offset
      relative to the IOP BAR0.

      Requests allocated in host memory must be aligned on 32-bytes boundary.

    - Fill the packet.

    - Post the packet to IOP by writing it to inbound queue. For requests
      allocated in IOP memory, write the offset to inbound queue port. For
      requests allocated in host memory, write (0x80000000|(bus_addr>>5))
      to the inbound queue port.

    - The IOP process the request. When the request is completed, it
      will be put into outbound queue. An outbound interrupt will be
      generated.

      For requests allocated in IOP memory, the request offset is posted to
      outbound queue.

      For requests allocated in host memory, (0x80000000|(bus_addr>>5))
      is posted to the outbound queue. If IOP_REQUEST_FLAG_OUTPUT_CONTEXT
      flag is set in the request, the low 32-bit context value will be
      posted instead.

    - The host read the outbound queue and complete the request.

      For requests allocated in IOP memory, the host driver free the request
      by writing it to the outbound queue.

Non-queued requests (reset/flush etc) can be sent via inbound message
register 0. An outbound message with the same value indicates the completion
of an inbound message.


I/O Request Workflow of Marvell Frey
--------------------------------------

All queued requests are handled via inbound/outbound list.

To send a request to the controller:

    - Allocate a free request in host DMA coherent memory.

      Requests allocated in host memory must be aligned on 32-bytes boundary.

    - Fill the request with index of the request in the flag.

      Fill a free inbound list unit with the physical address and the size of
      the request.

      Set up the inbound list write pointer with the index of previous unit,
      round to 0 if the index reaches the supported count of requests.

    - Post the inbound list writer pointer to IOP.

    - The IOP process the request. When the request is completed, the flag of
      the request with or-ed IOPMU_QUEUE_MASK_HOST_BITS will be put into a
      free outbound list unit and the index of the outbound list unit will be
      put into the copy pointer shadow register. An outbound interrupt will be
      generated.

    - The host read the outbound list copy pointer shadow register and compare
      with previous saved read ponter N. If they are different, the host will
      read the (N+1)th outbound list unit.

      The host get the index of the request from the (N+1)th outbound list
      unit and complete the request.

Non-queued requests (reset communication/reset/flush etc) can be sent via PCIe
Function 0 to CPU Message A register. The CPU to PCIe Function 0 Message register
with the same value indicates the completion of message.


User-level Interface
---------------------

The driver exposes following sysfs attributes:

     NAME                 R/W    Description
     driver-version        R     driver version string
     firmware-version      R     firmware version string
