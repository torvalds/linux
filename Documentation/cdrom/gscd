	Goldstar R420 CD-Rom device driver README

For all kind of other information about the GoldStar R420 CDROM
and this Linux device driver see the WWW page:

        http://linux.rz.fh-hannover.de/~raupach        


      If you are the editor of a Linux CD, you should
      enable gscd.c within your boot floppy kernel. Please,
      send me one of your CDs for free.


This current driver version 0.4a only supports reading data from the disk.
Currently we have no audio and no multisession or XA support.
The polling interface is used, no DMA.


Sometimes the GoldStar R420 is sold in a 'Reveal Multimedia Kit'. This kit's
drive interface is compatible, too.


Installation
------------

Change to '/usr/src/linux/drivers/cdrom' and edit the file 'gscd.h'. Insert
the i/o address of your interface card.

The default base address is 0x340. This will work for most applications. 
Address selection is accomplished by jumpers PN801-1 to PN801-4 on the 
GoldStar Interface Card.
Appropriate settings are: 0x300, 0x310, 0x320, 0x330, 0x340, 0x350, 0x360
0x370, 0x380, 0x390, 0x3A0, 0x3B0, 0x3C0, 0x3D0, 0x3E0, 0x3F0             

Then go back to '/usr/src/linux/' and 'make config' to build the new
configuration for your kernel. If you want to use the GoldStar driver
like a module, don't select 'GoldStar CDROM support'. By the way, you
have to include the iso9660 filesystem.

Now start compiling the kernel with 'make zImage'.
If you want to use the driver as a module, you have to do 'make modules' 
and 'make modules_install', additionally.
Install your new kernel as usual - maybe you do it with 'make zlilo'.

Before you can use the driver, you have to
   mknod /dev/gscd0 b 16 0
to create the appropriate device file (you only need to do this once).

If you use modules, you can try to insert the driver.
Say: 'insmod /usr/src/linux/modules/gscd.o'
or:  'insmod /usr/src/linux/modules/gscd.o gscd=<address>'
The driver should report its results.

That's it! Mount a disk, i.e. 'mount -rt iso9660 /dev/gscd0 /cdrom'

Feel free to report errors and suggestions to the following address.
Be sure, I'm very happy to receive your comments!
