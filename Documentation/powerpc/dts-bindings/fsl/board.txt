* Board Control and Status (BCSR)

Required properties:

 - compatible : Should be "fsl,<board>-bcsr"
 - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device

Example:

	bcsr@f8000000 {
		compatible = "fsl,mpc8360mds-bcsr";
		reg = <f8000000 8000>;
	};

* Freescale on board FPGA

This is the memory-mapped registers for on board FPGA.

Required properities:
- compatible : should be "fsl,fpga-pixis".
- reg : should contain the address and the length of the FPPGA register
  set.

Example (MPC8610HPCD):

	board-control@e8000000 {
		compatible = "fsl,fpga-pixis";
		reg = <0xe8000000 32>;
	};

* Freescale BCSR GPIO banks

Some BCSR registers act as simple GPIO controllers, each such
register can be represented by the gpio-controller node.

Required properities:
- compatible : Should be "fsl,<board>-bcsr-gpio".
- reg : Should contain the address and the length of the GPIO bank
  register.
- #gpio-cells : Should be two. The first cell is the pin number and the
  second cell is used to specify optional paramters (currently unused).
- gpio-controller : Marks the port as GPIO controller.

Example:

	bcsr@1,0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "fsl,mpc8360mds-bcsr";
		reg = <1 0 0x8000>;
		ranges = <0 1 0 0x8000>;

		bcsr13: gpio-controller@d {
			#gpio-cells = <2>;
			compatible = "fsl,mpc8360mds-bcsr-gpio";
			reg = <0xd 1>;
			gpio-controller;
		};
	};
