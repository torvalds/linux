--- What is AppArmor? ---

AppArmor is MAC style security extension for the Linux kernel.  It implements
a task centered policy, with task "profiles" being created and loaded
from user space.  Tasks on the system that do not have a profile defined for
them run in an unconfined state which is equivalent to standard Linux DAC
permissions.

--- How to enable/disable ---

set CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR=y

If AppArmor should be selected as the default security module then
   set CONFIG_DEFAULT_SECURITY="apparmor"
   and CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR_BOOTPARAM_VALUE=1

Build the kernel

If AppArmor is not the default security module it can be enabled by passing
security=apparmor on the kernel's command line.

If AppArmor is the default security module it can be disabled by passing
apparmor=0, security=XXXX (where XXX is valid security module), on the
kernel's command line

For AppArmor to enforce any restrictions beyond standard Linux DAC permissions
policy must be loaded into the kernel from user space (see the Documentation
and tools links).
