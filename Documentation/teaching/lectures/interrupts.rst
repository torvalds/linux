What is an interrupt?
=====================

An interrupt is an event that alters the normal execution flow of a program and
can be generated by hardware devices or even by the CPU itself.

Interrupts can be grouped into two categories based on the source of the interrupt:

.. slide:: Interrupts
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * **synchronous**, generated by executing an instruction
   * **asynchronous**, generated by an external event
   * **maskable**

     * can be ignored
     * signalled via INT pin
   * **non-maskable**

     * cannot be ignored
     * signalled via NMI pin

Synchronous interrupts, usually named exceptions, handle conditions detected by the
processor itself in the course of executing an instruction. Divide by zero or
a system call are examples of exceptions.

Asynchronous interrupts, usually named interrupts, are external events generated
by I/O devices. For example a network card generates an interrupts to signal
that a packet has arrived.

Exceptions
----------

There are two sources for exceptions:

.. slide:: Exceptions
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * processor detected

     - **faults**
     - **traps**
     - **aborts**
   * programmed


     - **int n**

Processor detected exceptions are raised when an abornmal condition is
detected while executing an instruction.

A fault is a type of exception that is reported before the execution of the
instruction and can be usually corrected. The saved EIP is the address of
the instruction that caused the fault, so after the fault is corrected
the program can re-execute the faulty instruction. (e.g page fault).

A trap is a type of exception that is reported after the execution of the
instruction in which the exception was detected. The saved EIP is the address
of the instruction after the instuction that caused the trap. (e.g debug trap).

A device supporting interrupts has an output pin used for signalling an Interrupt ReQuest. IRQ
pins are connected to a device named Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) which is connected
to CPU's INTR pin.

A PIC usually has a set of ports used to exchange information with the CPU. When a device
connected to one of the PIC's IRQ lines needs CPU attention the following flow happens:
   * device raises an interrupt on the corresponding IRQn pin
   * PIC converts the IRQ into a vector number and writes it to a port for CPU to read
   * PIC raises an interrupt on CPU INTR pin
   * PIC waits for CPU to acknowledge an interrupt
   * CPU handles the interrupt

Will see later how the CPU handles the interrupt. Important to notice is that by design PIC won't raise
another interrupt until the CPU acknowledged the current interrupt.

Each IRQ line can be individually disabled. This allows simplifying design by making sure that
interrupt handlers are always executed serially.

                      External interrupts

With multicore systems, each core has a local APIC used to process interrupts
from locally connected devices like timers or thermals sensors.

I/O APIC is used to distributed IRQ from external devices to CPU cores.

After discussing the hardware, now let's see how the processor handles an interrupt.

     * PIC can be programmed to disable a given IRQ line

   * at the CPU level

    * sti (SeT Interrupt flag)

Interrupt Descriptor Table
--------------------------

The interrupt descriptor table (IDT) associates each interrupt or exception
identifier with a descriptor for the instructions that service the associated
event. We will name the identifier as vector number and the associated 
instructions as interrupt/exception handler.

An IDT has the following characteristics:

.. slide:: Interrupt Descriptor Table
   :inline-contents: True
   :level: 2

   * it is used as a jump table by the CPU when a given vector is triggered
   * it is an array of 256 x 8 bytes entries
   * may reside anywhere in physical memory
   * processor locates IDT by the means of IDTR

Below we can find Linux IRQ vector layout. The first 32 entries are reserved
for exceptions, vector 128 is used for sycall interface and the rest are
used mostly for hardware interrupts handlers.

         |      |
         +------+
         | 255  |
         +------+

On x86 an IDT entry has 8 bytes and it is named gate. There can be 3 types of gates:

  * interrupt gate, holds the address of an interupt or exception handler.
    Jumping to the handler disables maskable interrupts (IF flag is cleared).
  * trap gates, similar with an interrupt gate but it does not disable maskable
    interrupts while jumping to interupt/exception handler.
  * task gates (not used in Linux)

Lets have a look at several fields of an IDT entry:

   * segment selector, index into GDT/LDT to find the start of the code segment where
     the interupt handlers resides
   * offset, offset inside the code segment
   * T, represents the type of gate
   * DPL, minimum privilege required for using the segments content.

Interrupt handler address
-------------------------

In order to find the interrupt handler address we first need to find the start
address of the code segment where interrupt handler resides. For this we
use the segment selector to index into GDT/LDT where we can find the corresponding
segment descriptor. This will provide the start address kept in the 'base' field.
Using base address and the offset we can now go at the start of the interrupt handler.

Stack of interrupt handler
--------------------------

Similar with control transfer to a normal function, a control transfer
to an interrupt or exception handler uses the stack to store the 
information needed for returning to the interrupted code.

As can be seen in the figure below, an interrupt pushes the EFLAGS register
before saving the address of the interrupted instruction. Certain types
of exceptions also cause an error code to be pushed on the stack to help
debug the exception.

Interrupt handler execution

   * check current privilege level

   * save EFLAGS, CS, EIP on stack
   * execute interrupt handler

Returning from an interrupt
---------------------------

IRET is used to from an interrupt handler. IRET is similar with RET except
that IRET increments EIP by extra four bytes (because of the flags on stack)
and moves the saved flags into EFLAGS register.

Nested interrupts and exceptions
--------------------------------

An interrupt handler may preempt both other interrupt handlers and exception handlers.
On the other hand, an exception handler never preempts an interrupt handler.

    * implemented using deferrable functions
    * softIRQ

      * runs in interrupt context
      * statically allocated
      * same handler may run in parallel on multiple cores

    * tasklet

      * runs in interrupt context
      * can be dinamically allocated
      * same handler runs are serialized
    * workqueues
   
      * run in process context

    * init: open_softirq()
