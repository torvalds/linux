The cx18 driver
===============

.. note::

   This documentation is outdated.

Some notes regarding the cx18 driver for the Conexant CX23418 MPEG
encoder chip:

1) Currently supported are:

	- Hauppauge HVR-1600
	- Compro VideoMate H900
	- Yuan MPC718
	- Conexant Raptor PAL/SECAM devkit

2) Some people have problems getting the i2c bus to work.
   The symptom is that the eeprom cannot be read and the card is
   unusable. This is probably fixed, but if you have problems
   then post to the video4linux or ivtv-users mailing list.

3) VBI (raw or sliced) has not yet been implemented.

4) MPEG indexing is not yet implemented.

5) The driver is still a bit rough around the edges, this should
   improve over time.
