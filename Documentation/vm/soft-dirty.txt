                            SOFT-DIRTY PTEs

  The soft-dirty is a bit on a PTE which helps to track which pages a task
writes to. In order to do this tracking one should

  1. Clear soft-dirty bits from the task's PTEs.

     This is done by writing "4" into the /proc/PID/clear_refs file of the
     task in question.

  2. Wait some time.

  3. Read soft-dirty bits from the PTEs.

     This is done by reading from the /proc/PID/pagemap. The bit 55 of the
     64-bit qword is the soft-dirty one. If set, the respective PTE was
     written to since step 1.


  Internally, to do this tracking, the writable bit is cleared from PTEs
when the soft-dirty bit is cleared. So, after this, when the task tries to
modify a page at some virtual address the #PF occurs and the kernel sets
the soft-dirty bit on the respective PTE.

  Note, that although all the task's address space is marked as r/o after the
soft-dirty bits clear, the #PF-s that occur after that are processed fast.
This is so, since the pages are still mapped to physical memory, and thus all
the kernel does is finds this fact out and puts both writable and soft-dirty
bits on the PTE.


  This feature is actively used by the checkpoint-restore project. You
