Smbfs is a filesystem that implements the SMB protocol, which is the
protocol used by Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95 and Windows NT.
Smbfs was inspired by Samba, the program written by Andrew Tridgell
that turns any Unix host into a file server for DOS or Windows clients.

Smbfs is a SMB client, but uses parts of samba for it's operation. For
