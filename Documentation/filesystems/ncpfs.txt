The ncpfs filesystem understands the NCP protocol, designed by the
Novell Corporation for their NetWare(tm) product.  NCP is functionally
similar to the NFS used in the TCP/IP community.
To mount a NetWare filesystem, you need a special mount program, which
can be found in the ncpfs package.  The home site for ncpfs is
ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs, but sunsite and its many mirrors
will have it as well.

Related products are linware and mars_nwe, which will give Linux partial
NetWare server functionality.  Linware's home site is
klokan.sh.cvut.cz/pub/linux/linware; mars_nwe can be found on
ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs.
