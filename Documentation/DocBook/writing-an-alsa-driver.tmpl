    <para>
      This document describes how to write an
      <ulink url="http://www.alsa-project.org/"><citetitle>
      ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)</citetitle></ulink>
      driver. The document focuses mainly on PCI soundcards.
      In the case of other device types, the API might
      be different, too. However, at least the ALSA kernel API is
      consistent, and therefore it would be still a bit help for
      writing them.
    </para>

    <para>
    This document targets people who already have enough
    C language skills and have basic linux kernel programming
    knowledge.  This document doesn't explain the general
    topic of linux kernel coding and doesn't cover low-level
    driver implementation details. It only describes
    the standard way to write a PCI sound driver on ALSA.
    </para>

    <para>
      If you are already familiar with the older ALSA ver.0.5.x API, you
    can check the drivers such as <filename>sound/pci/es1938.c</filename> or
    <filename>sound/pci/maestro3.c</filename> which have also almost the same
    code-base in the ALSA 0.5.x tree, so you can compare the differences.

      This document is still a draft version. Any feedback and
    corrections, please!!

      <title>General</title>
      <para>
        The ALSA drivers are provided in two ways.
      </para>

      <para>
        One is the trees provided as a tarball or via cvs from the
      ALSA's ftp site, and another is the 2.6 (or later) Linux kernel
      tree. To synchronize both, the ALSA driver tree is split into
      two different trees: alsa-kernel and alsa-driver. The former
      contains purely the source code for the Linux 2.6 (or later)
      tree. This tree is designed only for compilation on 2.6 or
      later environment. The latter, alsa-driver, contains many subtle
      files for compiling ALSA drivers outside of the Linux kernel tree,
      wrapper functions for older 2.2 and 2.4 kernels, to adapt the latest kernel API,
      and additional drivers which are still in development or in
      tests.  The drivers in alsa-driver tree will be moved to
      alsa-kernel (and eventually to the 2.6 kernel tree) when they are
      finished and confirmed to work fine.
      </para>

      <para>
        The file tree structure of ALSA driver is depicted below. Both
        alsa-kernel and alsa-driver have almost the same file
        structure, except for <quote>core</quote> directory. It's
        named as <quote>acore</quote> in alsa-driver tree.

    <section id="file-tree-core-directory">
      <title>core directory</title>
      <para>
        This directory contains the middle layer which is the heart
      of ALSA drivers. In this directory, the native ALSA modules are
      stored. The sub-directories contain different modules and are
      dependent upon the kernel config. 
      </para>

      <section id="file-tree-core-directory-oss">
        <title>core/oss</title>

        <para>
          The codes for PCM and mixer OSS emulation modules are stored
        in this directory. The rawmidi OSS emulation is included in
        the ALSA rawmidi code since it's quite small. The sequencer
        code is stored in <filename>core/seq/oss</filename> directory (see
        <link linkend="file-tree-core-directory-seq-oss"><citetitle>
        below</citetitle></link>).
        </para>
      </section>

      <section id="file-tree-core-directory-ioctl32">
        <title>core/ioctl32</title>

        <para>
          This directory contains the 32bit-ioctl wrappers for 64bit
        architectures such like x86-64, ppc64 and sparc64. For 32bit
        and alpha architectures, these are not compiled. 
        </para>
      </section>

      <section id="file-tree-core-directory-seq">
        <title>core/seq</title>
        <para>
          This directory and its sub-directories are for the ALSA
        sequencer. This directory contains the sequencer core and
        primary sequencer modules such like snd-seq-midi,
        snd-seq-virmidi, etc. They are compiled only when
        <constant>CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER</constant> is set in the kernel
        config.

    <section id="file-tree-include-directory">
      <title>include directory</title>
      <para>
        This is the place for the public header files of ALSA drivers,
      which are to be exported to user-space, or included by
      several files at different directories. Basically, the private
      header files should not be placed in this directory, but you may
      still find files there, due to historical reasons :) 
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="file-tree-drivers-directory">
      <title>drivers directory</title>
      <para>
        This directory contains code shared among different drivers
      on different architectures.  They are hence supposed not to be
      architecture-specific.
      For example, the dummy pcm driver and the serial MIDI
      driver are found in this directory. In the sub-directories,
      there is code for components which are independent from
      bus and cpu architectures. 
      </para>

      <section id="file-tree-drivers-directory-mpu401">
        <title>drivers/mpu401</title>

      <section id="file-tree-drivers-directory-opl3">
        <title>drivers/opl3 and opl4</title>

          The OPL3 and OPL4 FM-synth stuff is found here.

      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="file-tree-i2c-directory">
      <title>i2c directory</title>
      <para>
        This contains the ALSA i2c components.
      </para>

      <para>
        Although there is a standard i2c layer on Linux, ALSA has its
      own i2c code for some cards, because the soundcard needs only a
      simple operation and the standard i2c API is too complicated for
      such a purpose. 
      </para>

      <section id="file-tree-i2c-directory-l3">
        <title>i2c/l3</title>

    <section id="file-tree-synth-directory">
        <title>synth directory</title>
        <para>
          This contains the synth middle-level modules.
        </para>

        <para>
          So far, there is only Emu8000/Emu10k1 synth driver under
        the <filename>synth/emux</filename> sub-directory. 
        </para>
    </section>

    <section id="file-tree-pci-directory">
      <title>pci directory</title>
      <para>
        This directory and its sub-directories hold the top-level card modules
      for PCI soundcards and the code specific to the PCI BUS.
      </para>

      <para>
        The drivers compiled from a single file are stored directly
      in the pci directory, while the drivers with several source files are
      stored on their own sub-directory (e.g. emu10k1, ice1712). 
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="file-tree-isa-directory">
      <title>isa directory</title>
      <para>
        This directory and its sub-directories hold the top-level card modules
      for ISA soundcards. 
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="file-tree-arm-ppc-sparc-directories">
      <title>arm, ppc, and sparc directories</title>
      <para>
        They are used for top-level card modules which are
      specific to one of these architectures. 
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="file-tree-usb-directory">
      <title>usb directory</title>
      <para>
        This directory contains the USB-audio driver. In the latest version, the
      USB MIDI driver is integrated in the usb-audio driver. 
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="file-tree-pcmcia-directory">
      <title>pcmcia directory</title>
      <para>
        The PCMCIA, especially PCCard drivers will go here. CardBus
      drivers will be in the pci directory, because their API is identical
      to that of standard PCI cards. 
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="file-tree-oss-directory">
      <title>oss directory</title>
      <para>
        The OSS/Lite source files are stored here in Linux 2.6 (or
      later) tree. In the ALSA driver tarball, this directory is empty,
      of course :)

    <section id="card-management-card-instance">
      <title>Card Instance</title>
      <para>
      For each soundcard, a <quote>card</quote> record must be allocated.
      </para>

      <para>
      A card record is the headquarters of the soundcard.  It manages
      the whole list of devices (components) on the soundcard, such as
      PCM, mixers, MIDI, synthesizer, and so on.  Also, the card
      record holds the ID and the name strings of the card, manages
      the root of proc files, and controls the power-management states
      and hotplug disconnections.  The component list on the card
      record is used to manage the correct release of resources at
      destruction. 
      </para>

      <para>
        As mentioned above, to create a card instance, call
      <function>snd_card_create()</function>.

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  struct snd_card *card;
  int err;
  err = snd_card_create(index, id, module, extra_size, &card);
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        The function takes five arguments, the card-index number, the
        id string, the module pointer (usually
        <constant>THIS_MODULE</constant>),
        the size of extra-data space, and the pointer to return the
        card instance.  The extra_size argument is used to
        allocate card-&gt;private_data for the
        chip-specific data.  Note that these data
        are allocated by <function>snd_card_create()</function>.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="card-management-component">
      <title>Components</title>
      <para>
        After the card is created, you can attach the components
      (devices) to the card instance. In an ALSA driver, a component is
      represented as a struct <structname>snd_device</structname> object.
      A component can be a PCM instance, a control interface, a raw
      MIDI interface, etc.  Each such instance has one component
      entry.
      </para>

      <para>
        A component can be created via
        <function>snd_device_new()</function> function. 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  snd_device_new(card, SNDRV_DEV_XXX, chip, &ops);
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        This takes the card pointer, the device-level
      (<constant>SNDRV_DEV_XXX</constant>), the data pointer, and the
      callback pointers (<parameter>&amp;ops</parameter>). The
      device-level defines the type of components and the order of
      registration and de-registration.  For most components, the
      device-level is already defined.  For a user-defined component,
      you can use <constant>SNDRV_DEV_LOWLEVEL</constant>.
      </para>

      <para>
      This function itself doesn't allocate the data space. The data
      must be allocated manually beforehand, and its pointer is passed
      as the argument. This pointer is used as the
      (<parameter>chip</parameter> identifier in the above example)
      for the instance. 
      </para>

      <para>
        Each pre-defined ALSA component such as ac97 and pcm calls
      <function>snd_device_new()</function> inside its
      constructor. The destructor for each component is defined in the
      callback pointers.  Hence, you don't need to take care of
      calling a destructor for such a component.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you wish to create your own component, you need to
      set the destructor function to the dev_free callback in
      the <parameter>ops</parameter>, so that it can be released
      automatically via <function>snd_card_free()</function>.
      The next example will show an implementation of chip-specific
      data.

        In the case of PCI devices, you first have to call

      <title>Resource Allocation</title>
      <para>
        The allocation of I/O ports and irqs is done via standard kernel
      functions. Unlike ALSA ver.0.5.x., there are no helpers for
      that. And these resources must be released in the destructor
      function (see below). Also, on ALSA 0.9.x, you don't need to
      allocate (pseudo-)DMA for PCI like in ALSA 0.5.x.
      </para>

      <para>
        Now assume that the PCI device has an I/O port with 8 bytes
        and an interrupt. Then struct <structname>mychip</structname> will have the
        following fields:

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  struct mychip {
          struct snd_card *card;

          unsigned long port;

          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        For an I/O port (and also a memory region), you need to have
      the resource pointer for the standard resource management. For
      an irq, you have to keep only the irq number (integer). But you
      need to initialize this number as -1 before actual allocation,
      since irq 0 is valid. The port address and its resource pointer
      can be initialized as null by
      <function>kzalloc()</function> automatically, so you
      don't have to take care of resetting them. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The allocation of an I/O port is done like this:

        It will reserve the I/O port region of 8 bytes of the given
      PCI device. The returned value, chip-&gt;res_port, is allocated
      via <function>kmalloc()</function> by
      <function>request_region()</function>. The pointer must be
      released via <function>kfree()</function>, but there is a
      problem with this. This issue will be explained later.
      </para>

      <para>
        The allocation of an interrupt source is done like this:

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  if (request_irq(pci->irq, snd_mychip_interrupt,
                  IRQF_SHARED, "My Chip", chip)) {

  chip->irq = pci->irq;
]]>
          </programlisting>

        where <function>snd_mychip_interrupt()</function> is the
      interrupt handler defined <link
      linkend="pcm-interface-interrupt-handler"><citetitle>later</citetitle></link>.
      Note that chip-&gt;irq should be defined
      only when <function>request_irq()</function> succeeded.
      </para>

      <para>
      On the PCI bus, interrupts can be shared. Thus,
      <constant>IRQF_SHARED</constant> is used as the interrupt flag of
      <function>request_irq()</function>. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The last argument of <function>request_irq()</function> is the
      data pointer passed to the interrupt handler. Usually, the
      chip-specific record is used for that, but you can use what you
      like, too. 
      </para>

      <para>
        I won't give details about the interrupt handler at this
        point, but at least its appearance can be explained now. The
        interrupt handler looks usually like the following: 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  static irqreturn_t snd_mychip_interrupt(int irq, void *dev_id)
  {
          struct mychip *chip = dev_id;

          return IRQ_HANDLED;
  }
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        Now let's write the corresponding destructor for the resources
      above. The role of destructor is simple: disable the hardware
      (if already activated) and release the resources. So far, we
      have no hardware part, so the disabling code is not written here. 
      </para>

      <para>
        To release the resources, the <quote>check-and-release</quote>
        method is a safer way. For the interrupt, do like this: 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  if (chip->irq >= 0)
          free_irq(chip->irq, chip);
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        Since the irq number can start from 0, you should initialize
        chip-&gt;irq with a negative value (e.g. -1), so that you can
        check the validity of the irq number as above.
      </para>

      <para>
        When you requested I/O ports or memory regions via
	<function>pci_request_region()</function> or
	<function>pci_request_regions()</function> like in this example,
	release the resource(s) using the corresponding function,
	<function>pci_release_region()</function> or
	<function>pci_release_regions()</function>.

      <para>
	When you requested manually via <function>request_region()</function>
	or <function>request_mem_region</function>, you can release it via
	<function>release_resource()</function>.  Suppose that you keep
	the resource pointer returned from <function>request_region()</function>
	in chip-&gt;res_port, the release procedure looks like:

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  release_and_free_resource(chip->res_port);
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
      Don't forget to call <function>pci_disable_device()</function>
      before the end.
      </para>

      <para>
        And finally, release the chip-specific record.

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  kfree(chip);
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
      Again, remember that you cannot
      use the <parameter>__devexit</parameter> prefix for this destructor. 
      </para>

      <para>
      We didn't implement the hardware disabling part in the above.
      If you need to do this, please note that the destructor may be
      called even before the initialization of the chip is completed.
      It would be better to have a flag to skip hardware disabling
      if the hardware was not initialized yet.
      </para>

      <para>
      When the chip-data is assigned to the card using
      <function>snd_device_new()</function> with
      <constant>SNDRV_DEV_LOWLELVEL</constant> , its destructor is 
      called at the last.  That is, it is assured that all other
      components like PCMs and controls have already been released.
      You don't have to stop PCMs, etc. explicitly, but just
      call low-level hardware stopping.
      </para>

      <para>
        The management of a memory-mapped region is almost as same as
        the management of an I/O port. You'll need three fields like
        the following: 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  struct mychip {
          ....
          unsigned long iobase_phys;

  };
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        and the allocation would be like below:

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  if ((err = pci_request_regions(pci, "My Chip")) < 0) {
          kfree(chip);
          return err;
  }
  chip->iobase_phys = pci_resource_start(pci, 0);
  chip->iobase_virt = ioremap_nocache(chip->iobase_phys,
                                      pci_resource_len(pci, 0));
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
        
        and the corresponding destructor would be:

          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[

      </para>

        So far, so good. Let's finish the missing PCI
      stuff. At first, we need a
      <structname>pci_device_id</structname> table for this

      masks.

      <para>
        The first and second fields of
      the <structname>pci_device_id</structname> structure are the vendor and
      device IDs. If you have no reason to filter the matching
      devices, you can leave the remaining fields as above. The last
      field of the <structname>pci_device_id</structname> struct contains
      private data for this entry. You can specify any value here, for
      example, to define specific operations for supported device IDs.
      Such an example is found in the intel8x0 driver. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The last entry of this list is the terminator. You must

      field is the name string of this device. Note that you must not

      <para>
        The PCM middle layer of ALSA is quite powerful and it is only
      necessary for each driver to implement the low-level functions
      to access its hardware.
      </para>

      <para>
        For accessing to the PCM layer, you need to include
      <filename>&lt;sound/pcm.h&gt;</filename> first. In addition,
      <filename>&lt;sound/pcm_params.h&gt;</filename> might be needed
      if you access to some functions related with hw_param. 
      </para>

      <para>
        Each card device can have up to four pcm instances. A pcm
      instance corresponds to a pcm device file. The limitation of
      number of instances comes only from the available bit size of
      the Linux's device numbers. Once when 64bit device number is
      used, we'll have more pcm instances available. 
      </para>

      <para>
        A pcm instance consists of pcm playback and capture streams,
      and each pcm stream consists of one or more pcm substreams. Some
      soundcards support multiple playback functions. For example,
      emu10k1 has a PCM playback of 32 stereo substreams. In this case, at
      each open, a free substream is (usually) automatically chosen
      and opened. Meanwhile, when only one substream exists and it was
      already opened, the successful open will either block
      or error with <constant>EAGAIN</constant> according to the
      file open mode. But you don't have to care about such details in your
      driver. The PCM middle layer will take care of such work.

      <para>
        The <function>snd_pcm_new()</function> function takes four
      arguments. The first argument is the card pointer to which this
      pcm is assigned, and the second is the ID string. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The third argument (<parameter>index</parameter>, 0 in the
      above) is the index of this new pcm. It begins from zero. If
      you create more than one pcm instances, specify the
      different numbers in this argument. For example,
      <parameter>index</parameter> = 1 for the second PCM device.  
      </para>

      <para>
        The fourth and fifth arguments are the number of substreams
      for playback and capture, respectively. Here 1 is used for
      both arguments. When no playback or capture substreams are available,
      pass 0 to the corresponding argument.
      </para>

      <para>
        If a chip supports multiple playbacks or captures, you can
      specify more numbers, but they must be handled properly in
      open/close, etc. callbacks.  When you need to know which
      substream you are referring to, then it can be obtained from
      struct <structname>snd_pcm_substream</structname> data passed to each callback
      as follows:

        After setting the operators, you probably will want to

	<listitem><para>
          The <structfield>info</structfield> field contains the type and
        capabilities of this pcm. The bit flags are defined in
        <filename>&lt;sound/asound.h&gt;</filename> as
        <constant>SNDRV_PCM_INFO_XXX</constant>. Here, at least, you
        have to specify whether the mmap is supported and which
        interleaved format is supported.
        When the is supported, add the
        <constant>SNDRV_PCM_INFO_MMAP</constant> flag here. When the
        hardware supports the interleaved or the non-interleaved
        formats, <constant>SNDRV_PCM_INFO_INTERLEAVED</constant> or
        <constant>SNDRV_PCM_INFO_NONINTERLEAVED</constant> flag must
        be set, respectively. If both are supported, you can set both,
        too. 
        </para>

        <para>
          In the above example, <constant>MMAP_VALID</constant> and
        <constant>BLOCK_TRANSFER</constant> are specified for the OSS mmap
        mode. Usually both are set. Of course,
        <constant>MMAP_VALID</constant> is set only if the mmap is
        really supported. 
        </para>

        <para>
          The other possible flags are
        <constant>SNDRV_PCM_INFO_PAUSE</constant> and
        <constant>SNDRV_PCM_INFO_RESUME</constant>. The
        <constant>PAUSE</constant> bit means that the pcm supports the
        <quote>pause</quote> operation, while the
        <constant>RESUME</constant> bit means that the pcm supports
        the full <quote>suspend/resume</quote> operation.
	If the <constant>PAUSE</constant> flag is set,
	the <structfield>trigger</structfield> callback below
        must handle the corresponding (pause push/release) commands.
	The suspend/resume trigger commands can be defined even without
	the <constant>RESUME</constant> flag.  See <link
	linkend="power-management"><citetitle>
	Power Management</citetitle></link> section for details.
        </para>

	<para>
	  When the PCM substreams can be synchronized (typically,
	synchronized start/stop of a playback and a capture streams),
	you can give <constant>SNDRV_PCM_INFO_SYNC_START</constant>,
	too.  In this case, you'll need to check the linked-list of
	PCM substreams in the trigger callback.  This will be

        If the hardware supports more than one format, give all or'ed
        bits.  In the example above, the signed 16bit little-endian
        format is specified.

        <para>
        <structfield>rates</structfield> field contains the bit-flags of

        When the chip supports continuous rates, pass
        <constant>CONTINUOUS</constant> bit additionally.
        The pre-defined rate bits are provided only for typical
	rates. If your chip supports unconventional rates, you need to add
        the <constant>KNOT</constant> bit and set up the hardware
        constraint manually (explained later).

	<structfield>periods_max</structfield> and
	<structfield>periods_min</structfield> define the maximum and
	minimum number of periods in the buffer.
        </para>

	<para>
	The <quote>period</quote> is a term that corresponds to
	a fragment in the OSS world. The period defines the size at
	which a PCM interrupt is generated. This size strongly
	depends on the hardware. 
	Generally, the smaller period size will give you more
	interrupts, that is, more controls. 
	In the case of capture, this size defines the input latency.
	On the other hand, the whole buffer size defines the
	output latency for the playback direction.
	</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	<para>
	There is also a field <structfield>fifo_size</structfield>.
	This specifies the size of the hardware FIFO, but currently it

	<section id="pcm-interface-runtime-config">
	<title>PCM Configurations</title>
	<para>
	Ok, let's go back again to the PCM runtime records.
	The most frequently referred records in the runtime instance are
	the PCM configurations.
	The PCM configurations are stored in the runtime instance
	after the application sends <type>hw_params</type> data via
	alsa-lib.  There are many fields copied from hw_params and
	sw_params structs.  For example,
	<structfield>format</structfield> holds the format type
	chosen by the application.  This field contains the enum value
	<constant>SNDRV_PCM_FORMAT_XXX</constant>.
	</para>

	<para>
	One thing to be noted is that the configured buffer and period
	sizes are stored in <quote>frames</quote> in the runtime.
        In the ALSA world, 1 frame = channels * samples-size.
	For conversion between frames and bytes, you can use the
	<function>frames_to_bytes()</function> and
          <function>bytes_to_frames()</function> helper functions. 
          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>

]]>
            </programlisting>
          </informalexample>
        </para>

	<para>
	Also, many software parameters (sw_params) are
	stored in frames, too.  Please check the type of the field.
	<type>snd_pcm_uframes_t</type> is for the frames as unsigned
	integer while <type>snd_pcm_sframes_t</type> is for the frames
	as signed integer.
	</para>

	<section id="pcm-interface-runtime-dma">
	<title>DMA Buffer Information</title>
	<para>
	The DMA buffer is defined by the following four fields,
	<structfield>dma_area</structfield>,
	<structfield>dma_addr</structfield>,
	<structfield>dma_bytes</structfield> and
	<structfield>dma_private</structfield>.
	The <structfield>dma_area</structfield> holds the buffer
	pointer (the logical address).  You can call
	<function>memcpy</function> from/to 
	this pointer.  Meanwhile, <structfield>dma_addr</structfield>
	holds the physical address of the buffer.  This field is
	specified only when the buffer is a linear buffer.
	<structfield>dma_bytes</structfield> holds the size of buffer
	in bytes.  <structfield>dma_private</structfield> is used for
	the ALSA DMA allocator.
	</para>

	<para>
	If you use a standard ALSA function,
	<function>snd_pcm_lib_malloc_pages()</function>, for
	allocating the buffer, these fields are set by the ALSA middle
	layer, and you should <emphasis>not</emphasis> change them by
	yourself.  You can read them but not write them.
	On the other hand, if you want to allocate the buffer by
	yourself, you'll need to manage it in hw_params callback.
	At least, <structfield>dma_bytes</structfield> is mandatory.
	<structfield>dma_area</structfield> is necessary when the
	buffer is mmapped.  If your driver doesn't support mmap, this
	field is not necessary.  <structfield>dma_addr</structfield>
	is also optional.  You can use
	<structfield>dma_private</structfield> as you like, too.

	<section id="pcm-interface-runtime-status">
	<title>Running Status</title>
	<para>
	The running status can be referred via <constant>runtime-&gt;status</constant>.
	This is the pointer to the struct <structname>snd_pcm_mmap_status</structname>
	record.  For example, you can get the current DMA hardware
	pointer via <constant>runtime-&gt;status-&gt;hw_ptr</constant>.
	</para>

	<para>
	The DMA application pointer can be referred via
	<constant>runtime-&gt;control</constant>, which points to the

	However, accessing directly to this value is not recommended.

	<section id="pcm-interface-runtime-private">
	<title>Private Data</title> 
	<para>
	You can allocate a record for the substream and store it in

	<link linkend="pcm-interface-operators-open-callback"><citetitle>
	the open callback</citetitle></link>.
	Don't mix this with <constant>pcm-&gt;private_data</constant>.
	The <constant>pcm-&gt;private_data</constant> usually points to the

      <title>Operators</title>
      <para>
        OK, now let me give details about each pcm callback
      (<parameter>ops</parameter>). In general, every callback must
      return 0 if successful, or a negative error number
      such as <constant>-EINVAL</constant>. To choose an appropriate
      error number, it is advised to check what value other parts of
      the kernel return when the same kind of request fails.
      </para>

      <para>
        The callback function takes at least the argument with
        <structname>snd_pcm_substream</structname> pointer. To retrieve
        the chip record from the given substream instance, you can use the
        following macro. 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  int xxx() {
          struct mychip *chip = snd_pcm_substream_chip(substream);
          ....
  }
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>

	The macro reads <constant>substream-&gt;private_data</constant>,
	which is a copy of <constant>pcm-&gt;private_data</constant>.
	You can override the former if you need to assign different data
	records per PCM substream.  For example, the cmi8330 driver assigns
	different private_data for playback and capture directions,
	because it uses two different codecs (SB- and AD-compatible) for
	different directions.

        <para>
          Parameters to be initialized are retrieved by
          <function>params_xxx()</function> macros. To allocate
          buffer, you can call a helper function, 

          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  snd_pcm_lib_malloc_pages(substream, params_buffer_bytes(hw_params));

          </informalexample>

          <function>snd_pcm_lib_malloc_pages()</function> is available
	  only when the DMA buffers have been pre-allocated.
	  See the section <link
	  linkend="buffer-and-memory-buffer-types"><citetitle>
	  Buffer Types</citetitle></link> for more details.
        </para>

        <para>
          Note that this and <structfield>prepare</structfield> callbacks
        may be called multiple times per initialization.
        For example, the OSS emulation may
        call these callbacks at each change via its ioctl. 
        </para>

        <para>
          Thus, you need to be careful not to allocate the same buffers
        many times, which will lead to memory leaks!  Calling the
        helper function above many times is OK. It will release the
        previous buffer automatically when it was already allocated. 
        </para>

        <para>
          Another note is that this callback is non-atomic
        (schedulable). This is important, because the
        <structfield>trigger</structfield> callback 
        is atomic (non-schedulable). That is, mutexes or any
        schedule-related functions are not available in

        cannot be in the normal memory space. Some chips have their
        own buffer on the hardware which is not mappable. In such a

        The rest of pcm stuff is the PCM interrupt handler. The
      role of PCM interrupt handler in the sound driver is to update
      the buffer position and to tell the PCM middle layer when the
      buffer position goes across the prescribed period size. To
      inform this, call the <function>snd_pcm_period_elapsed()</function>

	In this case, you can call

        interrupt. 
        </para>

        <para>
          <function>snd_pcm_period_elapsed()</function> takes the
        substream pointer as its argument. Thus, you need to keep the
        substream pointer accessible from the chip instance. For
        example, define substream field in the chip record to hold the
        current running substream pointer, and set the pointer value
        at open callback (and reset at close callback).

          If you acquire a spinlock in the interrupt handler, and the

        release the lock before calling

      <title>Atomicity</title>
      <para>
      One of the most important (and thus difficult to debug) problems
      in kernel programming are race conditions.
      In the Linux kernel, they are usually avoided via spin-locks, mutexes
      or semaphores.  In general, if a race condition can happen
      in an interrupt handler, it has to be managed atomically, and you
      have to use a spinlock to protect the critical session. If the
      critical section is not in interrupt handler code and
      if taking a relatively long time to execute is acceptable, you
      should use mutexes or semaphores instead.
      </para>

      <para>
      As already seen, some pcm callbacks are atomic and some are
      not.  For example, the <parameter>hw_params</parameter> callback is
      non-atomic, while <parameter>trigger</parameter> callback is
      atomic.  This means, the latter is called already in a spinlock
      held by the PCM middle layer. Please take this atomicity into
      account when you choose a locking scheme in the callbacks.
      </para>

      <para>
      In the atomic callbacks, you cannot use functions which may call
      <function>schedule</function> or go to
      <function>sleep</function>.  Semaphores and mutexes can sleep,
      and hence they cannot be used inside the atomic callbacks
      (e.g. <parameter>trigger</parameter> callback).
      To implement some delay in such a callback, please use
      <function>udelay()</function> or <function>mdelay()</function>.

        specified in the <structname>snd_pcm_hardware</structname> structure (or in any

      <title>Definition of Controls</title>
      <para>
        To create a new control, you need to define the
	following three
      callbacks: <structfield>info</structfield>,
      <structfield>get</structfield> and
      <structfield>put</structfield>. Then, define a
      struct <structname>snd_kcontrol_new</structname> record, such as: 

        <example>
	  <title>Definition of a Control</title>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  static struct snd_kcontrol_new my_control __devinitdata = {
          .iface = SNDRV_CTL_ELEM_IFACE_MIXER,
          .name = "PCM Playback Switch",
          .index = 0,
          .access = SNDRV_CTL_ELEM_ACCESS_READWRITE,
          .private_value = 0xffff,
          .info = my_control_info,
          .get = my_control_get,
          .put = my_control_put
  };
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </example>
      </para>

      <para>
        Most likely the control is created via
      <function>snd_ctl_new1()</function>, and in such a case, you can
      add the <parameter>__devinitdata</parameter> prefix to the
      definition as above. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The <structfield>iface</structfield> field specifies the control
      type, <constant>SNDRV_CTL_ELEM_IFACE_XXX</constant>, which
      is usually <constant>MIXER</constant>.
      Use <constant>CARD</constant> for global controls that are not
      logically part of the mixer.
      If the control is closely associated with some specific device on
      the sound card, use <constant>HWDEP</constant>,
      <constant>PCM</constant>, <constant>RAWMIDI</constant>,
      <constant>TIMER</constant>, or <constant>SEQUENCER</constant>, and
      specify the device number with the
      <structfield>device</structfield> and
      <structfield>subdevice</structfield> fields.
      </para>

      <para>
        The <structfield>name</structfield> is the name identifier
      string. Since ALSA 0.9.x, the control name is very important,
      because its role is classified from its name. There are
      pre-defined standard control names. The details are described in
      the <link linkend="control-interface-control-names"><citetitle>
      Control Names</citetitle></link> subsection.
      </para>

      <para>
        The <structfield>index</structfield> field holds the index number
      of this control. If there are several different controls with
      the same name, they can be distinguished by the index
      number. This is the case when 
      several codecs exist on the card. If the index is zero, you can
      omit the definition above. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The <structfield>access</structfield> field contains the access
      type of this control. Give the combination of bit masks,
      <constant>SNDRV_CTL_ELEM_ACCESS_XXX</constant>, there.
      The details will be explained in
      the <link linkend="control-interface-access-flags"><citetitle>
      Access Flags</citetitle></link> subsection.
      </para>

      <para>
        The <structfield>private_value</structfield> field contains
      an arbitrary long integer value for this record. When using
      the generic <structfield>info</structfield>,
      <structfield>get</structfield> and
      <structfield>put</structfield> callbacks, you can pass a value 
      through this field. If several small numbers are necessary, you can
      combine them in bitwise. Or, it's possible to give a pointer
      (casted to unsigned long) of some record to this field, too. 
      </para>

      <para>
      The <structfield>tlv</structfield> field can be used to provide
      metadata about the control; see the
      <link linkend="control-interface-tlv">
      <citetitle>Metadata</citetitle></link> subsection.

      <title>Control Names</title>
      <para>
        There are some standards to define the control names. A
      control is usually defined from the three parts as
      <quote>SOURCE DIRECTION FUNCTION</quote>. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The first, <constant>SOURCE</constant>, specifies the source
      of the control, and is a string such as <quote>Master</quote>,
      <quote>PCM</quote>, <quote>CD</quote> and
      <quote>Line</quote>. There are many pre-defined sources. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The second, <constant>DIRECTION</constant>, is one of the
      following strings according to the direction of the control:
      <quote>Playback</quote>, <quote>Capture</quote>, <quote>Bypass
      Playback</quote> and <quote>Bypass Capture</quote>. Or, it can
      be omitted, meaning both playback and capture directions. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The third, <constant>FUNCTION</constant>, is one of the
      following strings according to the function of the control:
      <quote>Switch</quote>, <quote>Volume</quote> and
      <quote>Route</quote>. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The example of control names are, thus, <quote>Master Capture

      <title>Access Flags</title>

      <para>
      The access flag is the bitmask which specifies the access type
      of the given control.  The default access type is
      <constant>SNDRV_CTL_ELEM_ACCESS_READWRITE</constant>, 
      which means both read and write are allowed to this control.
      When the access flag is omitted (i.e. = 0), it is
      considered as <constant>READWRITE</constant> access as default. 
      </para>

      <para>
      When the control is read-only, pass
      <constant>SNDRV_CTL_ELEM_ACCESS_READ</constant> instead.
      In this case, you don't have to define
      the <structfield>put</structfield> callback.
      Similarly, when the control is write-only (although it's a rare
      case), you can use the <constant>WRITE</constant> flag instead, and
      you don't need the <structfield>get</structfield> callback.
      </para>

      <para>
      If the control value changes frequently (e.g. the VU meter),
      <constant>VOLATILE</constant> flag should be given.  This means
      that the control may be changed without

      notification</citetitle></link>. Applications should poll such
      a control constantly.
      </para>

      <para>
      When the control is inactive, set
      the <constant>INACTIVE</constant> flag, too.
      There are <constant>LOCK</constant> and

        The ALSA AC97 codec layer is a well-defined one, and you don't
      have to write much code to control it. Only low-level control
      routines are necessary. The AC97 codec API is defined in

      And then call <function>snd_ac97_mixer()</function> with an

        where chip-&gt;ac97 is a pointer to a newly created
        <type>ac97_t</type> instance.
        In this case, the chip pointer is set as the private data, so that
        the read/write callback functions can refer to this chip instance.
        This instance is not necessarily stored in the chip
	record.  If you need to change the register values from the
        driver, or need the suspend/resume of ac97 codecs, keep this
        pointer to pass to the corresponding functions.

    </section>

    <section id="api-ac97-callbacks">
      <title>Callbacks</title>
      <para>
        The standard callbacks are <structfield>read</structfield> and

      hardware low-level codes. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The <structfield>read</structfield> callback returns the

      <para>
      These callbacks are non-atomic like the control API callbacks.

        There are also other callbacks:

      <structfield>init</structfield>. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The <structfield>reset</structfield> callback is used to reset
      the codec. If the chip requires a special kind of reset, you can
      define this callback. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The <structfield>wait</structfield> callback is used to
      add some waiting time in the standard initialization of the codec. If the
      chip requires the extra waiting time, define this callback. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The <structfield>init</structfield> callback is used for

    <section id="api-ac97-updating-registers">
      <title>Updating Registers in The Driver</title>
      <para>
        If you need to access to the codec from the driver, you can
      call the following functions:
      <function>snd_ac97_write()</function>,
      <function>snd_ac97_read()</function>,
      <function>snd_ac97_update()</function> and

      <para>
        Both <function>snd_ac97_write()</function> and
        <function>snd_ac97_update()</function> functions are used to
        set a value to the given register
        (<constant>AC97_XXX</constant>). The difference between them is
        that <function>snd_ac97_update()</function> doesn't write a
        value if the given value has been already set, while
        <function>snd_ac97_write()</function> always rewrites the
        value. 

        <informalexample>

      <para>
        <function>snd_ac97_read()</function> is used to read the value

      <para>
        <function>snd_ac97_update_bits()</function> is used to update

      </para>

      <para>
        Also, there is a function to change the sample rate (of a
        given register such as
        <constant>AC97_PCM_FRONT_DAC_RATE</constant>) when VRA or
        DRA is supported by the codec:

      </para>

      <para>
        The following registers are available to set the rate:

      <constant>AC97_PCM_FRONT_DAC_RATE</constant>,
      <constant>AC97_PCM_LR_ADC_RATE</constant>,
      <constant>AC97_SPDIF</constant>. When
      <constant>AC97_SPDIF</constant> is specified, the register is
      not really changed but the corresponding IEC958 status bits will
      be updated.

    <section id="api-ac97-clock-adjustment">
      <title>Clock Adjustment</title>
      <para>
        In some chips, the clock of the codec isn't 48000 but using a
      PCI clock (to save a quartz!). In this case, change the field
      bus-&gt;clock to the corresponding
      value. For example, intel8x0 
      and es1968 drivers have their own function to read from the clock.

    <section id="api-ac97-proc-files">
      <title>Proc Files</title>
      <para>
        The ALSA AC97 interface will create a proc file such as

    <title>MIDI (MPU401-UART) Interface</title>

    <section id="midi-interface-general">
      <title>General</title>
      <para>
        Many soundcards have built-in MIDI (MPU401-UART)
      interfaces. When the soundcard supports the standard MPU401-UART
      interface, most likely you can use the ALSA MPU401-UART API. The
      MPU401-UART API is defined in
      <filename>&lt;sound/mpu401.h&gt;</filename>. 
      </para>

      <para>
        Some soundchips have a similar but slightly different
      implementation of mpu401 stuff. For example, emu10k1 has its own
      mpu401 routines. 
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="midi-interface-constructor">

      <para>
        To create a rawmidi object, call
      <function>snd_mpu401_uart_new()</function>. 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  struct snd_rawmidi *rmidi;
  snd_mpu401_uart_new(card, 0, MPU401_HW_MPU401, port, info_flags,
                      irq, irq_flags, &rmidi);
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        The first argument is the card pointer, and the second is the
      index of this component. You can create up to 8 rawmidi
      devices. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The third argument is the type of the hardware,
      <constant>MPU401_HW_XXX</constant>. If it's not a special one,
      you can use <constant>MPU401_HW_MPU401</constant>. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The 4th argument is the I/O port address. Many
      backward-compatible MPU401 have an I/O port such as 0x330. Or, it
      might be a part of its own PCI I/O region. It depends on the
      chip design. 
      </para>

      <para>
	The 5th argument is a bitflag for additional information.
        When the I/O port address above is part of the PCI I/O
      region, the MPU401 I/O port might have been already allocated
      (reserved) by the driver itself. In such a case, pass a bit flag
      <constant>MPU401_INFO_INTEGRATED</constant>,
      and the mpu401-uart layer will allocate the I/O ports by itself. 
      </para>

	<para>
	When the controller supports only the input or output MIDI stream,
	pass the <constant>MPU401_INFO_INPUT</constant> or
	<constant>MPU401_INFO_OUTPUT</constant> bitflag, respectively.
	Then the rawmidi instance is created as a single stream.
	</para>

	<para>
	<constant>MPU401_INFO_MMIO</constant> bitflag is used to change
	the access method to MMIO (via readb and writeb) instead of
	iob and outb. In this case, you have to pass the iomapped address
	to <function>snd_mpu401_uart_new()</function>.
	</para>

	<para>
	When <constant>MPU401_INFO_TX_IRQ</constant> is set, the output
	stream isn't checked in the default interrupt handler.  The driver
	needs to call <function>snd_mpu401_uart_interrupt_tx()</function>
	by itself to start processing the output stream in the irq handler.
	</para>

      <para>
        Usually, the port address corresponds to the command port and
        port + 1 corresponds to the data port. If not, you may change
        the <structfield>cport</structfield> field of
        struct <structname>snd_mpu401</structname> manually 
        afterward. However, <structname>snd_mpu401</structname> pointer is not
        returned explicitly by
        <function>snd_mpu401_uart_new()</function>. You need to cast
        rmidi-&gt;private_data to
        <structname>snd_mpu401</structname> explicitly, 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  struct snd_mpu401 *mpu;
  mpu = rmidi->private_data;
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        and reset the cport as you like:

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  mpu->cport = my_own_control_port;
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        The 6th argument specifies the irq number for UART. If the irq
      is already allocated, pass 0 to the 7th argument
      (<parameter>irq_flags</parameter>). Otherwise, pass the flags
      for irq allocation 
      (<constant>SA_XXX</constant> bits) to it, and the irq will be
      reserved by the mpu401-uart layer. If the card doesn't generate
      UART interrupts, pass -1 as the irq number. Then a timer
      interrupt will be invoked for polling. 
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="midi-interface-interrupt-handler">
      <title>Interrupt Handler</title>
      <para>
        When the interrupt is allocated in
      <function>snd_mpu401_uart_new()</function>, the private
      interrupt handler is used, hence you don't have anything else to do
      than creating the mpu401 stuff. Otherwise, you have to call
      <function>snd_mpu401_uart_interrupt()</function> explicitly when
      a UART interrupt is invoked and checked in your own interrupt
      handler.  
      </para>

      <para>
        In this case, you need to pass the private_data of the
        returned rawmidi object from
        <function>snd_mpu401_uart_new()</function> as the second
        argument of <function>snd_mpu401_uart_interrupt()</function>.

      <title>FM OPL3</title>
      <para>
        The FM OPL3 is still used in many chips (mainly for backward
      compatibility). ALSA has a nice OPL3 FM control layer, too. The
      OPL3 API is defined in
      <filename>&lt;sound/opl3.h&gt;</filename>. 
      </para>

      <para>
        FM registers can be directly accessed through the direct-FM API,
      defined in <filename>&lt;sound/asound_fm.h&gt;</filename>. In
      ALSA native mode, FM registers are accessed through
      the Hardware-Dependant Device direct-FM extension API, whereas in
      OSS compatible mode, FM registers can be accessed with the OSS
      direct-FM compatible API in <filename>/dev/dmfmX</filename> device. 
      </para>

      <para>
        To create the OPL3 component, you have two functions to
        call. The first one is a constructor for the <type>opl3_t</type>
        instance. 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  struct snd_opl3 *opl3;
  snd_opl3_create(card, lport, rport, OPL3_HW_OPL3_XXX,

]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        The first argument is the card pointer, the second one is the
      left port address, and the third is the right port address. In
      most cases, the right port is placed at the left port + 2. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The fourth argument is the hardware type.
      </para>

      <para>
        When the left and right ports have been already allocated by
      the card driver, pass non-zero to the fifth argument
      (<parameter>integrated</parameter>). Otherwise, the opl3 module will
      allocate the specified ports by itself. 
      </para>

      <para>
        When the accessing the hardware requires special method
        instead of the standard I/O access, you can create opl3 instance
        separately with <function>snd_opl3_new()</function>.

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[

]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
	Then set <structfield>command</structfield>,
	<structfield>private_data</structfield> and
	<structfield>private_free</structfield> for the private
	access function, the private data and the destructor.
	The l_port and r_port are not necessarily set.  Only the
	command must be set properly.  You can retrieve the data
	from the opl3-&gt;private_data field.
      </para>

      <para>
	After creating the opl3 instance via <function>snd_opl3_new()</function>,
	call <function>snd_opl3_init()</function> to initialize the chip to the
	proper state. Note that <function>snd_opl3_create()</function> always
	calls it internally.
      </para>

      <para>
        If the opl3 instance is created successfully, then create a
        hwdep device for this opl3. 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  struct snd_hwdep *opl3hwdep;

]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        The first argument is the <type>opl3_t</type> instance you
      created, and the second is the index number, usually 0. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The third argument is the index-offset for the sequencer
      client assigned to the OPL3 port. When there is an MPU401-UART,
      give 1 for here (UART always takes 0). 
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="misc-devices-hardware-dependent">
      <title>Hardware-Dependent Devices</title>
      <para>
        Some chips need user-space access for special
      controls or for loading the micro code. In such a case, you can
      create a hwdep (hardware-dependent) device. The hwdep API is
      defined in <filename>&lt;sound/hwdep.h&gt;</filename>. You can
      find examples in opl3 driver or
      <filename>isa/sb/sb16_csp.c</filename>. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The creation of the <type>hwdep</type> instance is done via
        <function>snd_hwdep_new()</function>. 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  struct snd_hwdep *hw;
  snd_hwdep_new(card, "My HWDEP", 0, &hw);
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        where the third argument is the index number.
      </para>

      <para>
        You can then pass any pointer value to the
        <parameter>private_data</parameter>.
        If you assign a private data, you should define the
        destructor, too. The destructor function is set in
        the <structfield>private_free</structfield> field.  

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  struct mydata *p = kmalloc(sizeof(*p), GFP_KERNEL);
  hw->private_data = p;
  hw->private_free = mydata_free;
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        and the implementation of the destructor would be:

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  static void mydata_free(struct snd_hwdep *hw)
  {
          struct mydata *p = hw->private_data;
          kfree(p);
  }
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        The arbitrary file operations can be defined for this
        instance. The file operators are defined in
        the <parameter>ops</parameter> table. For example, assume that
        this chip needs an ioctl. 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  hw->ops.open = mydata_open;
  hw->ops.ioctl = mydata_ioctl;
  hw->ops.release = mydata_release;
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        And implement the callback functions as you like.

    <section id="misc-devices-IEC958">
      <title>IEC958 (S/PDIF)</title>
      <para>
        Usually the controls for IEC958 devices are implemented via
      the control interface. There is a macro to compose a name string for
      IEC958 controls, <function>SNDRV_CTL_NAME_IEC958()</function>
      defined in <filename>&lt;include/asound.h&gt;</filename>.  
      </para>

      <para>
        There are some standard controls for IEC958 status bits. These
      controls use the type <type>SNDRV_CTL_ELEM_TYPE_IEC958</type>,
      and the size of element is fixed as 4 bytes array
      (value.iec958.status[x]). For the <structfield>info</structfield>
      callback, you don't specify 
      the value field for this type (the count field must be set,
      though). 
      </para>

      <para>
        <quote>IEC958 Playback Con Mask</quote> is used to return the
      bit-mask for the IEC958 status bits of consumer mode. Similarly,
      <quote>IEC958 Playback Pro Mask</quote> returns the bitmask for
      professional mode. They are read-only controls, and are defined
      as MIXER controls (iface =
      <constant>SNDRV_CTL_ELEM_IFACE_MIXER</constant>).  
      </para>

      <para>
        Meanwhile, <quote>IEC958 Playback Default</quote> control is
      defined for getting and setting the current default IEC958
      bits. Note that this one is usually defined as a PCM control
      (iface = <constant>SNDRV_CTL_ELEM_IFACE_PCM</constant>),
      although in some places it's defined as a MIXER control. 
      </para>

      <para>
        In addition, you can define the control switches to
      enable/disable or to set the raw bit mode. The implementation
      will depend on the chip, but the control should be named as
      <quote>IEC958 xxx</quote>, preferably using
      the <function>SNDRV_CTL_NAME_IEC958()</function> macro.

      <title>Buffer Types</title>
      <para>
        ALSA provides several different buffer allocation functions
      depending on the bus and the architecture. All these have a
      consistent API. The allocation of physically-contiguous pages is
      done via 
      <function>snd_malloc_xxx_pages()</function> function, where xxx
      is the bus type. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The allocation of pages with fallback is
      <function>snd_malloc_xxx_pages_fallback()</function>. This
      function tries to allocate the specified pages but if the pages
      are not available, it tries to reduce the page sizes until
      enough space is found.
      </para>

      <para>
      The release the pages, call
      <function>snd_free_xxx_pages()</function> function. 
      </para>

      <para>
      Usually, ALSA drivers try to allocate and reserve
       a large contiguous physical space
       at the time the module is loaded for the later use.
       This is called <quote>pre-allocation</quote>.
       As already written, you can call the following function at 
       pcm instance construction time (in the case of PCI bus). 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  snd_pcm_lib_preallocate_pages_for_all(pcm, SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV,

          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        where <parameter>size</parameter> is the byte size to be
      pre-allocated and the <parameter>max</parameter> is the maximum
      size to be changed via the <filename>prealloc</filename> proc file.
      The allocator will try to get an area as large as possible
      within the given size. 
      </para>

      <para>
      The second argument (type) and the third argument (device pointer)
      are dependent on the bus.
      In the case of the ISA bus, pass <function>snd_dma_isa_data()</function>
      as the third argument with <constant>SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV</constant> type.
      For the continuous buffer unrelated to the bus can be pre-allocated
      with <constant>SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_CONTINUOUS</constant> type and the
      <function>snd_dma_continuous_data(GFP_KERNEL)</function> device pointer,
      where <constant>GFP_KERNEL</constant> is the kernel allocation flag to
      use.
      For the PCI scatter-gather buffers, use
      <constant>SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV_SG</constant> with
      <function>snd_dma_pci_data(pci)</function>

          </citetitle></link> section).
      </para>

      <para>
        Once the buffer is pre-allocated, you can use the
        allocator in the <structfield>hw_params</structfield> callback: 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  snd_pcm_lib_malloc_pages(substream, size);
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        Note that you have to pre-allocate to use this function.

    <section id="buffer-and-memory-external-hardware">
      <title>External Hardware Buffers</title>
      <para>
        Some chips have their own hardware buffers and the DMA
      transfer from the host memory is not available. In such a case,
      you need to either 1) copy/set the audio data directly to the
      external hardware buffer, or 2) make an intermediate buffer and
      copy/set the data from it to the external hardware buffer in
      interrupts (or in tasklets, preferably).
      </para>

      <para>
        The first case works fine if the external hardware buffer is large
      enough.  This method doesn't need any extra buffers and thus is
      more effective. You need to define the
      <structfield>copy</structfield> and
      <structfield>silence</structfield> callbacks for 
      the data transfer. However, there is a drawback: it cannot
      be mmapped. The examples are GUS's GF1 PCM or emu8000's
      wavetable PCM. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The second case allows for mmap on the buffer, although you have
      to handle an interrupt or a tasklet to transfer the data
      from the intermediate buffer to the hardware buffer. You can find an
      example in the vxpocket driver. 
      </para>

      <para>
        Another case is when the chip uses a PCI memory-map
      region for the buffer instead of the host memory. In this case,
      mmap is available only on certain architectures like the Intel one.
      In non-mmap mode, the data cannot be transferred as in the normal
      way. Thus you need to define the <structfield>copy</structfield> and
      <structfield>silence</structfield> callbacks as well, 
      as in the cases above. The examples are found in
      <filename>rme32.c</filename> and <filename>rme96.c</filename>. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The implementation of the <structfield>copy</structfield> and
        <structfield>silence</structfield> callbacks depends upon 
        whether the hardware supports interleaved or non-interleaved
        samples. The <structfield>copy</structfield> callback is
        defined like below, a bit 
        differently depending whether the direction is playback or
        capture: 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  static int playback_copy(struct snd_pcm_substream *substream, int channel,
               snd_pcm_uframes_t pos, void *src, snd_pcm_uframes_t count);
  static int capture_copy(struct snd_pcm_substream *substream, int channel,
               snd_pcm_uframes_t pos, void *dst, snd_pcm_uframes_t count);
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        In the case of interleaved samples, the second argument
      (<parameter>channel</parameter>) is not used. The third argument
      (<parameter>pos</parameter>) points the 
      current position offset in frames. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The meaning of the fourth argument is different between
      playback and capture. For playback, it holds the source data
      pointer, and for capture, it's the destination data pointer. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The last argument is the number of frames to be copied.
      </para>

      <para>
        What you have to do in this callback is again different
        between playback and capture directions. In the
        playback case, you copy the given amount of data
        (<parameter>count</parameter>) at the specified pointer
        (<parameter>src</parameter>) to the specified offset
        (<parameter>pos</parameter>) on the hardware buffer. When
        coded like memcpy-like way, the copy would be like: 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  my_memcpy(my_buffer + frames_to_bytes(runtime, pos), src,
            frames_to_bytes(runtime, count));
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        For the capture direction, you copy the given amount of
        data (<parameter>count</parameter>) at the specified offset
        (<parameter>pos</parameter>) on the hardware buffer to the
        specified pointer (<parameter>dst</parameter>). 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  my_memcpy(dst, my_buffer + frames_to_bytes(runtime, pos),
            frames_to_bytes(runtime, count));
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>

        Note that both the position and the amount of data are given
      in frames. 
      </para>

      <para>
        In the case of non-interleaved samples, the implementation
      will be a bit more complicated. 
      </para>

      <para>
        You need to check the channel argument, and if it's -1, copy
      the whole channels. Otherwise, you have to copy only the
      specified channel. Please check
      <filename>isa/gus/gus_pcm.c</filename> as an example. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The <structfield>silence</structfield> callback is also
        implemented in a similar way. 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  static int silence(struct snd_pcm_substream *substream, int channel,
                     snd_pcm_uframes_t pos, snd_pcm_uframes_t count);
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        The meanings of arguments are the same as in the
      <structfield>copy</structfield> 
      callback, although there is no <parameter>src/dst</parameter>
      argument. In the case of interleaved samples, the channel
      argument has no meaning, as well as on
      <structfield>copy</structfield> callback.  
      </para>

      <para>
        The role of <structfield>silence</structfield> callback is to
        set the given amount 
        (<parameter>count</parameter>) of silence data at the
        specified offset (<parameter>pos</parameter>) on the hardware
        buffer. Suppose that the data format is signed (that is, the
        silent-data is 0), and the implementation using a memset-like
        function would be like: 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  my_memcpy(my_buffer + frames_to_bytes(runtime, pos), 0,
            frames_to_bytes(runtime, count));
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        In the case of non-interleaved samples, again, the
      implementation becomes a bit more complicated. See, for example,
      <filename>isa/gus/gus_pcm.c</filename>. 
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="buffer-and-memory-non-contiguous">
      <title>Non-Contiguous Buffers</title>
      <para>
        If your hardware supports the page table as in emu10k1 or the
      buffer descriptors as in via82xx, you can use the scatter-gather
      (SG) DMA. ALSA provides an interface for handling SG-buffers.
      The API is provided in <filename>&lt;sound/pcm.h&gt;</filename>. 
      </para>

      <para>
        For creating the SG-buffer handler, call
        <function>snd_pcm_lib_preallocate_pages()</function> or
        <function>snd_pcm_lib_preallocate_pages_for_all()</function>
        with <constant>SNDRV_DMA_TYPE_DEV_SG</constant>
	in the PCM constructor like other PCI pre-allocator.
        You need to pass <function>snd_dma_pci_data(pci)</function>,
        where pci is the struct <structname>pci_dev</structname> pointer
        of the chip as well.
        The <type>struct snd_sg_buf</type> instance is created as
        substream-&gt;dma_private. You can cast

          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[

        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        Then call <function>snd_pcm_lib_malloc_pages()</function>
      in the <structfield>hw_params</structfield> callback
      as well as in the case of normal PCI buffer.
      The SG-buffer handler will allocate the non-contiguous kernel
      pages of the given size and map them onto the virtually contiguous
      memory.  The virtual pointer is addressed in runtime-&gt;dma_area.
      The physical address (runtime-&gt;dma_addr) is set to zero,
      because the buffer is physically non-contiguous.
      The physical address table is set up in sgbuf-&gt;table.
      You can get the physical address at a certain offset via
      <function>snd_pcm_sgbuf_get_addr()</function>. 
      </para>

      <para>
        When a SG-handler is used, you need to set
      <function>snd_pcm_sgbuf_ops_page</function> as
      the <structfield>page</structfield> callback.
      (See <link linkend="pcm-interface-operators-page-callback">

      <para>
        To release the data, call

        It's possible to use a buffer allocated via

    <title>Proc Interface</title>
    <para>
      ALSA provides an easy interface for procfs. The proc files are
      very useful for debugging. I recommend you set up proc files if
      you write a driver and want to get a running status or register
      dumps. The API is found in
      <filename>&lt;sound/info.h&gt;</filename>. 
    </para>

    <para>
      To create a proc file, call
      <function>snd_card_proc_new()</function>. 

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  struct snd_info_entry *entry;
  int err = snd_card_proc_new(card, "my-file", &entry);
]]>
        </programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      where the second argument specifies the name of the proc file to be
    created. The above example will create a file
    <filename>my-file</filename> under the card directory,
    e.g. <filename>/proc/asound/card0/my-file</filename>. 
    </para>

    <para>
    Like other components, the proc entry created via
    <function>snd_card_proc_new()</function> will be registered and
    released automatically in the card registration and release
    functions.
    </para>

    <para>
      When the creation is successful, the function stores a new
    instance in the pointer given in the third argument.
    It is initialized as a text proc file for read only.  To use
    this proc file as a read-only text file as it is, set the read
    callback with a private data via 
     <function>snd_info_set_text_ops()</function>.

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  snd_info_set_text_ops(entry, chip, my_proc_read);
]]>
        </programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    
    where the second argument (<parameter>chip</parameter>) is the
    private data to be used in the callbacks. The third parameter
    specifies the read buffer size and the fourth
    (<parameter>my_proc_read</parameter>) is the callback function, which
    is defined like

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  static void my_proc_read(struct snd_info_entry *entry,
                           struct snd_info_buffer *buffer);
]]>
        </programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    
    </para>

    <para>
    In the read callback, use <function>snd_iprintf()</function> for
    output strings, which works just like normal
    <function>printf()</function>.  For example,

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  static void my_proc_read(struct snd_info_entry *entry,
                           struct snd_info_buffer *buffer)
  {
          struct my_chip *chip = entry->private_data;

          snd_iprintf(buffer, "This is my chip!\n");
          snd_iprintf(buffer, "Port = %ld\n", chip->port);
  }
]]>
        </programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>
    The file permissions can be changed afterwards.  As default, it's
    set as read only for all users.  If you want to add write
    permission for the user (root as default), do as follows:

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
 entry->mode = S_IFREG | S_IRUGO | S_IWUSR;
]]>
        </programlisting>
      </informalexample>

    and set the write buffer size and the callback

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  entry->c.text.write = my_proc_write;
]]>
        </programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>
      For the write callback, you can use
    <function>snd_info_get_line()</function> to get a text line, and
    <function>snd_info_get_str()</function> to retrieve a string from
    the line. Some examples are found in
    <filename>core/oss/mixer_oss.c</filename>, core/oss/and
    <filename>pcm_oss.c</filename>. 
    </para>

    <para>
      For a raw-data proc-file, set the attributes as follows:

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  static struct snd_info_entry_ops my_file_io_ops = {
          .read = my_file_io_read,
  };

  entry->content = SNDRV_INFO_CONTENT_DATA;
  entry->private_data = chip;
  entry->c.ops = &my_file_io_ops;
  entry->size = 4096;
  entry->mode = S_IFREG | S_IRUGO;
]]>
        </programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>
      The callback is much more complicated than the text-file
      version. You need to use a low-level I/O functions such as
      <function>copy_from/to_user()</function> to transfer the
      data.

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  static long my_file_io_read(struct snd_info_entry *entry,

                              char *buf,
                              unsigned long count,
                              unsigned long pos)
  {
          long size = count;
          if (pos + size > local_max_size)
                  size = local_max_size - pos;
          if (copy_to_user(buf, local_data + pos, size))

  <chapter id="power-management">
    <title>Power Management</title>
    <para>
      If the chip is supposed to work with suspend/resume
      functions, you need to add power-management code to the
      driver. The additional code for power-management should be
      <function>ifdef</function>'ed with
      <constant>CONFIG_PM</constant>. 
    </para>

	<para>
	If the driver <emphasis>fully</emphasis> supports suspend/resume
	that is, the device can be
	properly resumed to its state when suspend was called,
	you can set the <constant>SNDRV_PCM_INFO_RESUME</constant> flag
	in the pcm info field.  Usually, this is possible when the
	registers of the chip can be safely saved and restored to
	RAM. If this is set, the trigger callback is called with
	<constant>SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_RESUME</constant> after the resume
	callback completes. 
	</para>

	<para>
	Even if the driver doesn't support PM fully but 
	partial suspend/resume is still possible, it's still worthy to
	implement suspend/resume callbacks. In such a case, applications
	would reset the status by calling
	<function>snd_pcm_prepare()</function> and restart the stream
	appropriately.  Hence, you can define suspend/resume callbacks
	below but don't set <constant>SNDRV_PCM_INFO_RESUME</constant>
	info flag to the PCM.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	Note that the trigger with SUSPEND can always be called when
	<function>snd_pcm_suspend_all</function> is called,
	regardless of the <constant>SNDRV_PCM_INFO_RESUME</constant> flag.
	The <constant>RESUME</constant> flag affects only the behavior
	of <function>snd_pcm_resume()</function>.
	(Thus, in theory,
	<constant>SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_RESUME</constant> isn't needed
	to be handled in the trigger callback when no
	<constant>SNDRV_PCM_INFO_RESUME</constant> flag is set.  But,
	it's better to keep it for compatibility reasons.)
	</para>
    <para>
      In the earlier version of ALSA drivers, a common
      power-management layer was provided, but it has been removed.
      The driver needs to define the suspend/resume hooks according to
      the bus the device is connected to.  In the case of PCI drivers, the
      callbacks look like below:

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>

    A typical code would be like:

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[

  }
]]>
        </programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>
	As shown in the above, it's better to save registers after
	suspending the PCM operations via
	<function>snd_pcm_suspend_all()</function> or
	<function>snd_pcm_suspend()</function>.  It means that the PCM
	streams are already stoppped when the register snapshot is
	taken.  But, remember that you don't have to restart the PCM
	stream in the resume callback. It'll be restarted via 
	trigger call with <constant>SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_RESUME</constant>
	when necessary.
    </para>

    <para>
      OK, we have all callbacks now. Let's set them up. In the
      initialization of the card, make sure that you can get the chip
      data from the card instance, typically via
      <structfield>private_data</structfield> field, in case you
      created the chip data individually.

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  static int __devinit snd_mychip_probe(struct pci_dev *pci,
                               const struct pci_device_id *pci_id)
  {
          ....
          struct snd_card *card;
          struct mychip *chip;
          int err;
          ....
          err = snd_card_create(index[dev], id[dev], THIS_MODULE, 0, &card);
          ....
          chip = kzalloc(sizeof(*chip), GFP_KERNEL);
          ....
          card->private_data = chip;
          ....
  }
]]>
        </programlisting>
      </informalexample>

	When you created the chip data with
	<function>snd_card_create()</function>, it's anyway accessible
	via <structfield>private_data</structfield> field.

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  static int __devinit snd_mychip_probe(struct pci_dev *pci,

  {
          ....
          struct snd_card *card;
          struct mychip *chip;
          int err;
          ....
          err = snd_card_create(index[dev], id[dev], THIS_MODULE,
                                sizeof(struct mychip), &card);

      </informalexample>

    </para>

    <para>
      If you need a space to save the registers, allocate the
	buffer for it here, too, since it would be fatal
    if you cannot allocate a memory in the suspend phase.
    The allocated buffer should be released in the corresponding
    destructor.
    </para>

    <para>
      And next, set suspend/resume callbacks to the pci_driver.

    <para>
      There are standard module options for ALSA. At least, each
      module should have the <parameter>index</parameter>,
      <parameter>id</parameter> and <parameter>enable</parameter>
      options. 
    </para>

    <para>
      If the module supports multiple cards (usually up to
      8 = <constant>SNDRV_CARDS</constant> cards), they should be
      arrays. The default initial values are defined already as
      constants for easier programming:

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  static int index[SNDRV_CARDS] = SNDRV_DEFAULT_IDX;
  static char *id[SNDRV_CARDS] = SNDRV_DEFAULT_STR;
  static int enable[SNDRV_CARDS] = SNDRV_DEFAULT_ENABLE_PNP;
]]>
        </programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>
      If the module supports only a single card, they could be single
    variables, instead.  <parameter>enable</parameter> option is not
    always necessary in this case, but it would be better to have a
    dummy option for compatibility.
    </para>

    <para>
      The module parameters must be declared with the standard
    <function>module_param()()</function>,
    <function>module_param_array()()</function> and
    <function>MODULE_PARM_DESC()</function> macros.
    </para>

    <para>
      The typical coding would be like below:

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  #define CARD_NAME "My Chip"

  module_param_array(index, int, NULL, 0444);
  MODULE_PARM_DESC(index, "Index value for " CARD_NAME " soundcard.");
  module_param_array(id, charp, NULL, 0444);

      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>
      Also, don't forget to define the module description, classes,
      license and devices. Especially, the recent modprobe requires to
      define the module license as GPL, etc., otherwise the system is
      shown as <quote>tainted</quote>. 

      <informalexample>

    <title>How To Put Your Driver Into ALSA Tree</title>
	<section>
	<title>General</title>
	<para>
	So far, you've learned how to write the driver codes.
	And you might have a question now: how to put my own
	driver into the ALSA driver tree?
	Here (finally :) the standard procedure is described briefly.
	</para>

	<para>
	Suppose that you create a new PCI driver for the card
	<quote>xyz</quote>.  The card module name would be
	snd-xyz.  The new driver is usually put into the alsa-driver
	tree, <filename>alsa-driver/pci</filename> directory in
	the case of PCI cards.
	Then the driver is evaluated, audited and tested
	by developers and users.  After a certain time, the driver
	will go to the alsa-kernel tree (to the corresponding directory,
	such as <filename>alsa-kernel/pci</filename>) and eventually
 	will be integrated into the Linux 2.6 tree (the directory would be
	<filename>linux/sound/pci</filename>).
	</para>

	<para>
	In the following sections, the driver code is supposed
	to be put into alsa-driver tree. The two cases are covered:
	a driver consisting of a single source file and one consisting
	of several source files.

    <title>Useful Functions</title>

    <section id="useful-functions-snd-printk">
      <title><function>snd_printk()</function> and friends</title>
      <para>
        ALSA provides a verbose version of the
      <function>printk()</function> function. If a kernel config
      <constant>CONFIG_SND_VERBOSE_PRINTK</constant> is set, this
      function prints the given message together with the file name
      and the line of the caller. The <constant>KERN_XXX</constant>
      prefix is processed as 
      well as the original <function>printk()</function> does, so it's
      recommended to add this prefix, e.g. 

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  snd_printk(KERN_ERR "Oh my, sorry, it's extremely bad!\n");
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>
      </para>

      <para>
        There are also <function>printk()</function>'s for
      debugging. <function>snd_printd()</function> can be used for
      general debugging purposes. If
      <constant>CONFIG_SND_DEBUG</constant> is set, this function is
      compiled, and works just like
      <function>snd_printk()</function>. If the ALSA is compiled
      without the debugging flag, it's ignored. 
      </para>

      <para>
        <function>snd_printdd()</function> is compiled in only when
      <constant>CONFIG_SND_DEBUG_VERBOSE</constant> is set. Please note
      that <constant>CONFIG_SND_DEBUG_VERBOSE</constant> is not set as default
      even if you configure the alsa-driver with
      <option>--with-debug=full</option> option. You need to give
      explicitly <option>--with-debug=detect</option> option instead. 
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="useful-functions-snd-bug">
      <title><function>snd_BUG()</function></title>
      <para>
        It shows the <computeroutput>BUG?</computeroutput> message and
      stack trace as well as <function>snd_BUG_ON</function> at the point.
      It's useful to show that a fatal error happens there. 
      </para>
      <para>
	 When no debug flag is set, this macro is ignored. 
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="useful-functions-snd-bug-on">
      <title><function>snd_BUG_ON()</function></title>
      <para>
        <function>snd_BUG_ON()</function> macro is similar with
	<function>WARN_ON()</function> macro. For example,  

        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  snd_BUG_ON(!pointer);
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>

	or it can be used as the condition,
        <informalexample>
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
  if (snd_BUG_ON(non_zero_is_bug))
          return -EINVAL;
]]>
          </programlisting>
        </informalexample>

      </para>

      <para>
        The macro takes an conditional expression to evaluate.
	When <constant>CONFIG_SND_DEBUG</constant>, is set, the
	expression is actually evaluated. If it's non-zero, it shows
	the warning message such as
	<computeroutput>BUG? (xxx)</computeroutput>
	normally followed by stack trace.  It returns the evaluated
	value.
	When no <constant>CONFIG_SND_DEBUG</constant> is set, this
	macro always returns zero.
