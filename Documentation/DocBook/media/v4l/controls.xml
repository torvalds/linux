    <title>User Controls</title>

    <para>Devices typically have a number of user-settable controls
such as brightness, saturation and so on, which would be presented to
the user on a graphical user interface. But, different devices
will have different controls available, and furthermore, the range of
possible values, and the default value will vary from device to
device. The control ioctls provide the information and a mechanism to
create a nice user interface for these controls that will work
correctly with any device.</para>

    <para>All controls are accessed using an ID value. V4L2 defines
several IDs for specific purposes. Drivers can also implement their
own custom controls using <constant>V4L2_CID_PRIVATE_BASE</constant>
and higher values. The pre-defined control IDs have the prefix
<constant>V4L2_CID_</constant>, and are listed in <xref
linkend="control-id" />. The ID is used when querying the attributes of
a control, and when getting or setting the current value.</para>

    <para>Generally applications should present controls to the user
without assumptions about their purpose. Each control comes with a
name string the user is supposed to understand. When the purpose is
non-intuitive the driver writer should provide a user manual, a user
interface plug-in or a driver specific panel application. Predefined
IDs were introduced to change a few controls programmatically, for
example to mute a device during a channel switch.</para>

    <para>Drivers may enumerate different controls after switching
the current video input or output, tuner or modulator, or audio input
or output. Different in the sense of other bounds, another default and
current value, step size or other menu items. A control with a certain
<emphasis>custom</emphasis> ID can also change name and
type.<footnote>
	<para>It will be more convenient for applications if drivers
make use of the <constant>V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_DISABLED</constant> flag, but
that was never required.</para>
      </footnote> Control values are stored globally, they do not
change when switching except to stay within the reported bounds. They
also do not change &eg; when the device is opened or closed, when the
tuner radio frequency is changed or generally never without
application request. Since V4L2 specifies no event mechanism, panel
applications intended to cooperate with other panel applications (be
they built into a larger application, as a TV viewer) may need to
regularly poll control values to update their user
interface.<footnote>
	<para>Applications could call an ioctl to request events.
After another process called &VIDIOC-S-CTRL; or another ioctl changing
shared properties the &func-select; function would indicate
readability until any ioctl (querying the properties) is
called.</para>
      </footnote></para>

    <para>
      All controls use machine endianness.

    <title>Extended Controls</title>

    <section>
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>The control mechanism as originally designed was meant
to be used for user settings (brightness, saturation, etc). However,
it turned out to be a very useful model for implementing more
complicated driver APIs where each driver implements only a subset of
a larger API.</para>

      <para>The MPEG encoding API was the driving force behind
designing and implementing this extended control mechanism: the MPEG
standard is quite large and the currently supported hardware MPEG
encoders each only implement a subset of this standard. Further more,
many parameters relating to how the video is encoded into an MPEG
stream are specific to the MPEG encoding chip since the MPEG standard
only defines the format of the resulting MPEG stream, not how the
video is actually encoded into that format.</para>

      <para>Unfortunately, the original control API lacked some
features needed for these new uses and so it was extended into the
(not terribly originally named) extended control API.</para>

      <para>Even though the MPEG encoding API was the first effort
to use the Extended Control API, nowadays there are also other classes
of Extended Controls, such as Camera Controls and FM Transmitter Controls.
The Extended Controls API as well as all Extended Controls classes are
described in the following text.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>The Extended Control API</title>

      <para>Three new ioctls are available: &VIDIOC-G-EXT-CTRLS;,
&VIDIOC-S-EXT-CTRLS; and &VIDIOC-TRY-EXT-CTRLS;. These ioctls act on
arrays of controls (as opposed to the &VIDIOC-G-CTRL; and
&VIDIOC-S-CTRL; ioctls that act on a single control). This is needed
since it is often required to atomically change several controls at
once.</para>

      <para>Each of the new ioctls expects a pointer to a
&v4l2-ext-controls;. This structure contains a pointer to the control
array, a count of the number of controls in that array and a control
class. Control classes are used to group similar controls into a
single class. For example, control class
<constant>V4L2_CTRL_CLASS_USER</constant> contains all user controls
(&ie; all controls that can also be set using the old
<constant>VIDIOC_S_CTRL</constant> ioctl). Control class
<constant>V4L2_CTRL_CLASS_MPEG</constant> contains all controls
relating to MPEG encoding, etc.</para>

      <para>All controls in the control array must belong to the
specified control class. An error is returned if this is not the
case.</para>

      <para>It is also possible to use an empty control array (count
== 0) to check whether the specified control class is
supported.</para>

      <para>The control array is a &v4l2-ext-control; array. The
<structname>v4l2_ext_control</structname> structure is very similar to
&v4l2-control;, except for the fact that it also allows for 64-bit
values and pointers to be passed.</para>

      <para>It is important to realize that due to the flexibility of
controls it is necessary to check whether the control you want to set
actually is supported in the driver and what the valid range of values
is. So use the &VIDIOC-QUERYCTRL; and &VIDIOC-QUERYMENU; ioctls to
check this. Also note that it is possible that some of the menu
indices in a control of type <constant>V4L2_CTRL_TYPE_MENU</constant>
may not be supported (<constant>VIDIOC_QUERYMENU</constant> will
return an error). A good example is the list of supported MPEG audio
bitrates. Some drivers only support one or two bitrates, others
support a wider range.</para>

      <para>
	All controls use machine endianness.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Enumerating Extended Controls</title>

      <para>The recommended way to enumerate over the extended
controls is by using &VIDIOC-QUERYCTRL; in combination with the
<constant>V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_NEXT_CTRL</constant> flag:</para>

      <informalexample>
	<programlisting>
&v4l2-queryctrl; qctrl;

qctrl.id = V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_NEXT_CTRL;
while (0 == ioctl (fd, &VIDIOC-QUERYCTRL;, &amp;qctrl)) {

	qctrl.id |= V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_NEXT_CTRL;
}
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>The initial control ID is set to 0 ORed with the
<constant>V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_NEXT_CTRL</constant> flag. The
<constant>VIDIOC_QUERYCTRL</constant> ioctl will return the first
control with a higher ID than the specified one. When no such controls
are found an error is returned.</para>

      <para>If you want to get all controls within a specific control
class, then you can set the initial
<structfield>qctrl.id</structfield> value to the control class and add
an extra check to break out of the loop when a control of another
control class is found:</para>

      <informalexample>
	<programlisting>
qctrl.id = V4L2_CTRL_CLASS_MPEG | V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_NEXT_CTRL;
while (0 == ioctl (fd, &VIDIOC-QUERYCTRL;, &amp;qctrl)) {
	if (V4L2_CTRL_ID2CLASS (qctrl.id) != V4L2_CTRL_CLASS_MPEG)
		break;
		/* ... */
		qctrl.id |= V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_NEXT_CTRL;
	}
</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>The 32-bit <structfield>qctrl.id</structfield> value is
subdivided into three bit ranges: the top 4 bits are reserved for
flags (&eg; <constant>V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_NEXT_CTRL</constant>) and are not
actually part of the ID. The remaining 28 bits form the control ID, of
which the most significant 12 bits define the control class and the
least significant 16 bits identify the control within the control
class. It is guaranteed that these last 16 bits are always non-zero
for controls. The range of 0x1000 and up are reserved for
driver-specific controls. The macro
<constant>V4L2_CTRL_ID2CLASS(id)</constant> returns the control class
ID based on a control ID.</para>

      <para>If the driver does not support extended controls, then
<constant>VIDIOC_QUERYCTRL</constant> will fail when used in
combination with <constant>V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_NEXT_CTRL</constant>. In
that case the old method of enumerating control should be used (see
1.8). But if it is supported, then it is guaranteed to enumerate over
all controls, including driver-private controls.</para>

      <title>Creating Control Panels</title>

      <para>It is possible to create control panels for a graphical
user interface where the user can select the various controls.
Basically you will have to iterate over all controls using the method
described above. Each control class starts with a control of type
<constant>V4L2_CTRL_TYPE_CTRL_CLASS</constant>.
<constant>VIDIOC_QUERYCTRL</constant> will return the name of this
control class which can be used as the title of a tab page within a
control panel.</para>

      <para>The flags field of &v4l2-queryctrl; also contains hints on
the behavior of the control. See the &VIDIOC-QUERYCTRL; documentation
for more details.</para>

overall average bitrate for the stream and keeps it below or equal to the set bitrate. In the first case
the average bitrate for the whole stream will be smaller then the set bitrate. This is caused because the
average is calculated for smaller number of frames, on the other hand enabling this setting will ensure that
the stream will meet tight bandwidth contraints. Applicable to encoders.

with steps of 32 or 64 characters. The result is it must always contain a string with size multiple of 32 or 64. </entry>

	  <title>Unsynchronised LED flash (software strobe)</title>

	  <para>
	    Unsynchronised LED flash is controlled directly by the
	    host as the sensor. The flash must be enabled by the host
	    before the exposure of the image starts and disabled once
	    it ends. The host is fully responsible for the timing of
	    the flash.

	  <title>Synchronised LED flash (hardware strobe)</title>

	  <para>
	    The synchronised LED flash is pre-programmed by the host
	    (power and timeout) but controlled by the sensor through a
	    strobe signal from the sensor to the flash.
	  </para>

	  <para>
	    The sensor controls the flash duration and timing. This
