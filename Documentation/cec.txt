CEC Kernel Support
==================

The CEC framework provides a unified kernel interface for use with HDMI CEC
hardware. It is designed to handle a multiple variants of hardware. Adding to
the flexibility of the framework it enables to set which parts of the CEC
protocol processing is handled by the hardware, by the driver and by the
userspace application.


The CEC Protocol
----------------

The CEC protocol enables cosumer electronic devices to communicate with each
other through the HDMI connection. The protocol uses logical addresses in the
communication. The logical address is strictly connected with the functionality
provided by the device. The TV acting as the communication hub is always
assigned address 0. The physicall addressis determined by physical connection
between devices.

The protocol enables control of compatible devices with a single remote.
Synchronous power on/standby, instant playback with changing the content source
on the TV.

The device type defines are defined by the CEC standard.

The cec_adapter structure represents the adapter. It has a number of
operations that have to be implemented in the driver: adap_enable() enables
or disables the physical adapter, adap_log_addr() tells the driver which
logical address should be configured. This may be called multiple times
to configure multiple logical addresses. Calling adap_enable(false) or
adap_log_addr(CEC_LOG_ADDR_INVALID) will clear all configured logical
addresses.

The adap_transmit op will setup the hardware to send out the given CEC message.
This will return without waiting for the transmission to finish. The
adap_transmit_timed_out() function is called when the current transmission timed
out and the hardware needs to be informed of this (the hardware should go back
from transmitter to receiver mode).

The adapter driver will also call into the adapter: it should call
cec_transmit_done() when a cec transfer was finalized and cec_received_msg()
when a new message was received.

When a message is received the corresponding received() op is called depending
on the logical address it is received on. If the message is not handled by
that the received op is called as fallback. The driver can hook into these ops
and do whatever it needs to do in order to respond to the message.

The driver has to call cec_create_adapter to initialize the structure. If
the 'caps' argument is non-zero, then it will also create a /dev/cecX
device node to allow userspace to interact with the CEC device. Userspace
can request those capabilities with the CEC_G_CAPS ioctl.

In order for a CEC adapter to be configured it needs a physical address.
This is normally assigned by the driver. It is either 0.0.0.0 for a TV (aka
video receiver) or it is derived from the EDID that the source received
from the sink. This is normally set by the driver before enabling the CEC
adapter, or it is set from userspace in the case of CEC USB dongles (although
embedded systems might also want to set this manually).

After enabling the CEC adapter it has to be configured. The CEC adapter has
to be informed for which CEC device types a logical address has to be found.
The CEC framework will attempt to find such logical addresses. If none are
found, then it will fall back to logical address Unregistered (15).

When a CEC message is received the CEC framework will take care of the CEC
core messages CEC_OP_GET_CEC_VERSION, CEC_OP_GIVE_PHYS_ADDR and CEC_OP_ABORT.
Then it will call the received() op (if set), and finally it will queue it
for handling by userspace if create_devnode was true, or send back
FEATURE_ABORT if create_devnode was false.

Drivers can also use the cec_transmit_msg() call to transmit a message. This
can either be fire-and-forget (the CEC framework will queue up messages in a
transmit queue), or a blocking wait until there is either an error or a
reply to the message.


The Userspace API
=================

CEC communication
-----------------

This is the main message struct:

struct cec_msg {
	__u32 len;
	__u8  msg[16];
	__u32 status;
	/* If non-zero, then wait for a reply with this opcode.
	   If there was an error when sending the msg or FeatureAbort
	   was returned, then reply is set to 0.
	   If reply is non-zero upon return, then len/msg are set to
	   the received message.
	   If reply is zero upon return and status has the CEC_TX_STATUS_FEATURE_ABORT
	   bit set, then len/msg are set to the received feature abort message.
	   If reply is zero upon return and status has the CEC_TX_STATUS_REPLY_TIMEOUT
	   bit set, then no reply was seen at all.
	   This field is ignored with CEC_RECEIVE.
	   If reply is non-zero for CEC_TRANSMIT and the message is a broadcast,
	   then -EINVAL is returned.
	   if reply is non-zero, then timeout is set to 1000 (the required maximum
	   response time).
	 */
	__u8  reply;
	/* timeout (in ms) is used to timeout CEC_RECEIVE.
	   Set to 0 if you want to wait forever. */
	__u32 timeout;
	struct timespec ts;
};

16 bytes for the message, the length of the message, a status value
in case of errors. Optionally you can request the CEC framework to
wait after transmitting the message until the 'reply' message is
returned (or Feature Abort). This is done asynchronously, i.e. it
does not require that the reply comes right after the transmit, but
other messages in between are allowed.

#define CEC_TRANSMIT		_IOWR('a', 1, struct cec_msg)
#define CEC_RECEIVE		_IOWR('a', 2, struct cec_msg)

With CEC_TRANSMIT you can transmit a message, either blocking or
non-blocking. With CEC_RECEIVE you can dequeue a pending received
message from the internal queue or wait for a message to arrive
(if called in blocking mode).

   The cec_version determines which CEC version should be followed.

   It will try to claim num_log_addrs devices. The log_addr_type array has
   the logical address type that needs to be claimed for that device, and
   the log_addr array will receive the actual logical address that was
   claimed for that device or 0xff if no address could be claimed.

   The primary_device_type contains the primary device for each logical
   address.

   For CEC 2.0 devices the all_device_types parameter to use with the
   Report Features command, and 'features' contains the remaining parameters
   (RC Profile and Device Features) to use in Report Features.

   An error is returned if the adapter is disabled or if there
   is no physical address assigned or if cec_version is unknown.

   If no logical address of one or more of the given types could be claimed,
   then log_addr will be set to CEC_LOG_ADDR_INVALID.

   If no logical address could be claimed at all, then num_log_addrs will
   be set to 1, log_addr_type[0] to UNREGISTERED and log_addr[0] to 0xf.

The event ioctl is used to get a single struct cec_event if it was
previously posted by the driver by the cec_post_event function.

#define CEC_G_EVENT		_IOWR('a', 9, struct cec_event)

Remote control handling
-----------------------

The CEC framework provides two ways of handling the key messages of remote
control. In the first case, the CEC framework will handle these messages and
provide the keypressed via the RC framework. In the second case the messages
related to the key down/up events are not parsed by the framework and are
passed to the userspace as raw messages.

Switching between these modes is done with a special ioctl.
