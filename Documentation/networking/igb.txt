Identifying Your Adapter
========================

This driver supports all 82575, 82576 and 82580-based Intel (R) gigabit network
connections.

For specific information on how to identify your adapter, go to the Adapter &
Driver ID Guide at:

    http://support.intel.com/support/go/network/adapter/idguide.htm

Command Line Parameters
=======================

The default value for each parameter is generally the recommended setting,
unless otherwise noted.

max_vfs
-------
Valid Range:   0-7
Default Value: 0

This parameter adds support for SR-IOV.  It causes the driver to spawn up to
max_vfs worth of virtual function.


Additional Configurations
=========================

  Jumbo Frames
  ------------
  Jumbo Frames support is enabled by changing the MTU to a value larger than
  the default of 1500.  Use the ifconfig command to increase the MTU size.
  For example:

       ifconfig eth<x> mtu 9000 up

  This setting is not saved across reboots.

  Notes:

  - The maximum MTU setting for Jumbo Frames is 9216.  This value coincides
    with the maximum Jumbo Frames size of 9234 bytes.

  - Using Jumbo Frames at 10 or 100 Mbps may result in poor performance or
    loss of link.

  Ethtool
  -------
  The driver utilizes the ethtool interface for driver configuration and
  diagnostics, as well as displaying statistical information. The latest
  version of Ethtool can be found at:

  http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/network/ethtool/

  Enabling Wake on LAN* (WoL)
  ---------------------------
  WoL is configured through the Ethtool* utility.

  For instructions on enabling WoL with Ethtool, refer to the Ethtool man page.

  WoL will be enabled on the system during the next shut down or reboot.
  For this driver version, in order to enable WoL, the igb driver must be
  loaded when shutting down or rebooting the system.

  Wake On LAN is only supported on port A of multi-port adapters.

  Wake On LAN is not supported for the Intel(R) Gigabit VT Quad Port Server
  Adapter.

  Multiqueue
  ----------
  In this mode, a separate MSI-X vector is allocated for each queue and one
  for "other" interrupts such as link status change and errors.  All
  interrupts are throttled via interrupt moderation.  Interrupt moderation
  must be used to avoid interrupt storms while the driver is processing one
  interrupt.  The moderation value should be at least as large as the expected
  time for the driver to process an interrupt. Multiqueue is off by default.

  REQUIREMENTS: MSI-X support is required for Multiqueue. If MSI-X is not
  found, the system will fallback to MSI or to Legacy interrupts.
