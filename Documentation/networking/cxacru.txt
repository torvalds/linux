Firmware is required for this device: http://accessrunner.sourceforge.net/

While it is capable of managing/maintaining the ADSL connection without the
module loaded, the device will sometimes stop responding after unloading the
driver and it is necessary to unplug/remove power to the device to fix this.

Detected devices will appear as ATM devices named "cxacru". In /sys/class/atm/
these are directories named cxacruN where N is the device number. A symlink
named device points to the USB interface device's directory which contains
several sysfs attribute files for retrieving device statistics:

* adsl_controller_version

* adsl_headend
* adsl_headend_environment
	Information about the remote headend.

* downstream_attenuation (dB)
* downstream_bits_per_frame
* downstream_rate (kbps)
* downstream_snr_margin (dB)
	Downstream stats.

* upstream_attenuation (dB)
* upstream_bits_per_frame
* upstream_rate (kbps)
* upstream_snr_margin (dB)
* transmitter_power (dBm/Hz)
	Upstream stats.

* downstream_crc_errors
* downstream_fec_errors
* downstream_hec_errors
* upstream_crc_errors
* upstream_fec_errors
* upstream_hec_errors
	Error counts.

* line_startable
	Indicates that ADSL support on the device
	is/can be enabled, see adsl_start.

* line_status
	"initialising"
	"down"
	"attempting to activate"
	"training"
	"channel analysis"
	"exchange"
	"waiting"
	"up"

	Changes between "down" and "attempting to activate"
	if there is no signal.

* link_status
	"not connected"
	"connected"
	"lost"

* mac_address

* modulation
	"" (when not connected)
	"ANSI T1.413"
	"ITU-T G.992.1 (G.DMT)"
	"ITU-T G.992.2 (G.LITE)"

* startup_attempts
	Count of total attempts to initialise ADSL.

To enable/disable ADSL, the following can be written to the adsl_state file:
	"start"
	"stop
	"restart" (stops, waits 1.5s, then starts)
	"poll" (used to resume status polling if it was disabled due to failure)

Changes in adsl/line state are reported via kernel log messages:
	[4942145.150704] ATM dev 0: ADSL state: running
	[4942243.663766] ATM dev 0: ADSL line: down
