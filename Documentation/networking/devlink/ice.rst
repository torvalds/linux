ice devlink support
===================

This document describes the devlink features implemented by the ``ice``
device driver.

Info versions
=============

The ``ice`` driver reports the following versions

.. list-table:: devlink info versions implemented
    :widths: 5 5 5 90

    * - Name
      - Type
      - Example
      - Description
    * - ``board.id``
      - fixed
      - K65390-000
      - The Product Board Assembly (PBA) identifier of the board.
    * - ``fw.mgmt``
      - running
      - 2.1.7
      - 3-digit version number of the management firmware running on the
        Embedded Management Processor of the device. It controls the PHY,
        link, access to device resources, etc. Intel documentation refers to
        this as the EMP firmware.
    * - ``fw.mgmt.api``
      - running
      - 1.5.1
      - 3-digit version number (major.minor.patch) of the API exported over
        the AdminQ by the management firmware. Used by the driver to
        identify what commands are supported. Historical versions of the
        kernel only displayed a 2-digit version number (major.minor).
    * - ``fw.mgmt.build``
      - running
      - 0x305d955f
      - Unique identifier of the source for the management firmware.
    * - ``fw.undi``
      - running
      - 1.2581.0
      - Version of the Option ROM containing the UEFI driver. The version is
        reported in ``major.minor.patch`` format. The major version is
        incremented whenever a major breaking change occurs, or when the
        minor version would overflow. The minor version is incremented for
        non-breaking changes and reset to 1 when the major version is
        incremented. The patch version is normally 0 but is incremented when
        a fix is delivered as a patch against an older base Option ROM.
    * - ``fw.psid.api``
      - running
      - 0.80
      - Version defining the format of the flash contents.
    * - ``fw.bundle_id``
      - running
      - 0x80002ec0
      - Unique identifier of the firmware image file that was loaded onto
        the device. Also referred to as the EETRACK identifier of the NVM.
    * - ``fw.app.name``
      - running
      - ICE OS Default Package
      - The name of the DDP package that is active in the device. The DDP
        package is loaded by the driver during initialization. Each
        variation of the DDP package has a unique name.
    * - ``fw.app``
      - running
      - 1.3.1.0
      - The version of the DDP package that is active in the device. Note
        that both the name (as reported by ``fw.app.name``) and version are
        required to uniquely identify the package.
    * - ``fw.app.bundle_id``
      - running
      - 0xc0000001
      - Unique identifier for the DDP package loaded in the device. Also
        referred to as the DDP Track ID. Can be used to uniquely identify
        the specific DDP package.
    * - ``fw.netlist``
      - running
      - 1.1.2000-6.7.0
      - The version of the netlist module. This module defines the device's
        Ethernet capabilities and default settings, and is used by the
        management firmware as part of managing link and device
        connectivity.
    * - ``fw.netlist.build``
      - running
      - 0xee16ced7
      - The first 4 bytes of the hash of the netlist module contents.

Flash Update
============

The ``ice`` driver implements support for flash update using the
``devlink-flash`` interface. It supports updating the device flash using a
combined flash image that contains the ``fw.mgmt``, ``fw.undi``, and
``fw.netlist`` components.

.. list-table:: List of supported overwrite modes
   :widths: 5 95

   * - Bits
     - Behavior
   * - ``DEVLINK_FLASH_OVERWRITE_SETTINGS``
     - Do not preserve settings stored in the flash components being
       updated. This includes overwriting the port configuration that
       determines the number of physical functions the device will
       initialize with.
   * - ``DEVLINK_FLASH_OVERWRITE_SETTINGS`` and ``DEVLINK_FLASH_OVERWRITE_IDENTIFIERS``
     - Do not preserve either settings or identifiers. Overwrite everything
       in the flash with the contents from the provided image, without
       performing any preservation. This includes overwriting device
       identifying fields such as the MAC address, VPD area, and device
       serial number. It is expected that this combination be used with an
       image customized for the specific device.

The ice hardware does not support overwriting only identifiers while
preserving settings, and thus ``DEVLINK_FLASH_OVERWRITE_IDENTIFIERS`` on its
own will be rejected. If no overwrite mask is provided, the firmware will be
instructed to preserve all settings and identifying fields when updating.

Reload
======

The ``ice`` driver supports activating new firmware after a flash update
using ``DEVLINK_CMD_RELOAD`` with the ``DEVLINK_RELOAD_ACTION_FW_ACTIVATE``
action.

.. code:: shell

    $ devlink dev reload pci/0000:01:00.0 reload action fw_activate

The new firmware is activated by issuing a device specific Embedded
Management Processor reset which requests the device to reset and reload the
EMP firmware image.

The driver does not currently support reloading the driver via
``DEVLINK_RELOAD_ACTION_DRIVER_REINIT``.

Port split
==========

The ``ice`` driver supports port splitting only for port 0, as the FW has
a predefined set of available port split options for the whole device.

A system reboot is required for port split to be applied.

The following command will select the port split option with 4 ports:

.. code:: shell

    $ devlink port split pci/0000:16:00.0/0 count 4

The list of all available port options will be printed to dynamic debug after
each ``split`` and ``unsplit`` command. The first option is the default.

.. code:: shell

    ice 0000:16:00.0: Available port split options and max port speeds (Gbps):
    ice 0000:16:00.0: Status  Split      Quad 0          Quad 1
    ice 0000:16:00.0:         count  L0  L1  L2  L3  L4  L5  L6  L7
    ice 0000:16:00.0: Active  2     100   -   -   - 100   -   -   -
    ice 0000:16:00.0:         2      50   -  50   -   -   -   -   -
    ice 0000:16:00.0: Pending 4      25  25  25  25   -   -   -   -
    ice 0000:16:00.0:         4      25  25   -   -  25  25   -   -
    ice 0000:16:00.0:         8      10  10  10  10  10  10  10  10
    ice 0000:16:00.0:         1     100   -   -   -   -   -   -   -

There could be multiple FW port options with the same port split count. When
the same port split count request is issued again, the next FW port option with
the same port split count will be selected.

``devlink port unsplit`` will select the option with a split count of 1. If
there is no FW option available with split count 1, you will receive an error.

Regions
=======

The ``ice`` driver implements the following regions for accessing internal
device data.

.. list-table:: regions implemented
    :widths: 15 85

    * - Name
      - Description
    * - ``nvm-flash``
      - The contents of the entire flash chip, sometimes referred to as
        the device's Non Volatile Memory.
    * - ``device-caps``
      - The contents of the device firmware's capabilities buffer. Useful to
        determine the current state and configuration of the device.

Users can request an immediate capture of a snapshot via the
``DEVLINK_CMD_REGION_NEW``
