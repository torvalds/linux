=============================

autocorking_size - INTEGER
	Setting SMC auto corking size:
	SMC auto corking is like TCP auto corking from the application's
	perspective of view. When applications do consecutive small
	write()/sendmsg() system calls, we try to coalesce these small writes
	as much as possible, to lower total amount of CDC and RDMA Write been
	sent.
	autocorking_size limits the maximum corked bytes that can be sent to
	the under device in 1 single sending. If set to 0, the SMC auto corking
	is disabled.
	Applications can still use TCP_CORK for optimal behavior when they
	know how/when to uncork their sockets.

	Default: 64K

smcr_buf_type - INTEGER
        Controls which type of sndbufs and RMBs to use in later newly created
        SMC-R link group. Only for SMC-R.

        Default: 0 (physically contiguous sndbufs and RMBs)

        Possible values:

        - 0 - Use physically contiguous buffers
        - 1 - Use virtually contiguous buffers
        - 2 - Mixed use of the two types. Try physically contiguous buffers first.
          If not available, use virtually contiguous buffers then.
