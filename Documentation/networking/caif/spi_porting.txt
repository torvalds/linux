- CAIF SPI porting -

- CAIF SPI basics:

Running CAIF over SPI needs some extra setup, owing to the nature of SPI.
Two extra GPIOs have been added in order to negotiate the transfers
 between the master and the slave. The minimum requirement for running
CAIF over SPI is a SPI slave chip and two GPIOs (more details below).
Please note that running as a slave implies that you need to keep up
with the master clock. An overrun or underrun event is fatal.

- CAIF SPI framework:

To make porting as easy as possible, the CAIF SPI has been divided in
two parts. The first part (called the interface part) deals with all
generic functionality such as length framing, SPI frame negotiation
and SPI frame delivery and transmission. The other part is the CAIF
SPI slave device part, which is the module that you have to write if
you want to run SPI CAIF on a new hardware. This part takes care of
the physical hardware, both with regard to SPI and to GPIOs.

- Implementing a CAIF SPI device:

	- Functionality provided by the CAIF SPI slave device:

	In order to implement a SPI device you will, as a minimum,
	need to implement the following
	functions:

	int (*init_xfer) (struct cfspi_xfer * xfer, struct cfspi_dev *dev):

	This function is called by the CAIF SPI interface to give
	you a chance to set up your hardware to be ready to receive
	a stream of data from the master. The xfer structure contains
	both physical and logical addresses, as well as the total length
	of the transfer in both directions.The dev parameter can be used
	to map to different CAIF SPI slave devices.

	void (*sig_xfer) (bool xfer, struct cfspi_dev *dev):

	This function is called by the CAIF SPI interface when the output
	(SPI_INT) GPIO needs to change state. The boolean value of the xfer
	variable indicates whether the GPIO should be asserted (HIGH) or
	deasserted (LOW). The dev parameter can be used to map to different CAIF
	SPI slave devices.

	- Functionality provided by the CAIF SPI interface:

	void (*ss_cb) (bool assert, struct cfspi_ifc *ifc);

	This function is called by the CAIF SPI slave device in order to
	signal a change of state of the input GPIO (SS) to the interface.
	Only active edges are mandatory to be reported.
	This function can be called from IRQ context (recommended in order
	not to introduce latency). The ifc parameter should be the pointer
	returned from the platform probe function in the SPI device structure.

	void (*xfer_done_cb) (struct cfspi_ifc *ifc);

	This function is called by the CAIF SPI slave device in order to
	report that a transfer is completed. This function should only be
	called once both the transmission and the reception are completed.
	This function can be called from IRQ context (recommended in order
	not to introduce latency). The ifc parameter should be the pointer
	returned from the platform probe function in the SPI device structure.

	- Connecting the bits and pieces:

		- Filling in the SPI slave device structure:

		Connect the necessary callback functions.
		Indicate clock speed (used to calculate toggle delays).
		Chose a suitable name (helps debugging if you use several CAIF
		SPI slave devices).
		Assign your private data (can be used to map to your structure).

		- Filling in the SPI slave platform device structure:
		Add name of driver to connect to ("cfspi_sspi").
		Assign the SPI slave device structure as platform data.

- Padding:

In order to optimize throughput, a number of SPI padding options are provided.
Padding can be enabled independently for uplink and downlink transfers.
Padding can be enabled for the head, the tail and for the total frame size.
The padding needs to be correctly configured on both sides of the link.
The padding can be changed via module parameters in cfspi_sspi.c or via
the sysfs directory of the cfspi_sspi driver (before device registration).
