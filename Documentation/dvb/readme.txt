Linux Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) subsystem
=============================================

The main development site and CVS repository for these
drivers is http://linuxtv.org/.

The developer mailing list linux-dvb is also hosted there,
see http://linuxtv.org/lists.php. Please check
the archive http://linuxtv.org/pipermail/linux-dvb/
and the Wiki http://linuxtv.org/wiki/
before asking newbie questions on the list.

API documentation, utilities and test/example programs
are available as part of the old driver package for Linux 2.4
(linuxtv-dvb-1.0.x.tar.gz), or from CVS (module DVB).
We plan to split this into separate packages, but it's not
been done yet.
