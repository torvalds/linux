How to get the Nebula, PCTV, FusionHDTV Lite and Twinhan DST cards working
==========================================================================

This class of cards has a bt878a as the PCI interface, and
require the bttv driver.

Please pay close attention to the warning about the bttv module
options below for the DST card.

1) General informations
=======================

These drivers require the bttv driver to provide the means to access
the i2c bus and the gpio pins of the bt8xx chipset.

Because of this, you need to enable
"Device drivers" => "Multimedia devices"
  => "Video For Linux" => "BT848 Video For Linux"

Furthermore you need to enable
"Device drivers" => "Multimedia devices" => "Digital Video Broadcasting Devices"
  => "DVB for Linux" "DVB Core Support" "BT8xx based PCI cards"

2) Loading Modules
==================

In general you need to load the bttv driver, which will handle the gpio and
i2c communication for us, plus the common dvb-bt8xx device driver.
The frontends for Nebula (nxt6000), Pinnacle PCTV (cx24110), TwinHan (dst),
FusionHDTV DVB-T Lite (mt352) and FusionHDTV5 Lite (lgdt330x) are loaded
automatically by the dvb-bt8xx device driver.

3a) Nebula / Pinnacle PCTV / FusionHDTV Lite
---------------------------------------------

   $ modprobe bttv (normally bttv is being loaded automatically by kmod)
   $ modprobe dvb-bt8xx

(or just place dvb-bt8xx in /etc/modules for automatic loading)


3b) TwinHan and Clones
--------------------------

   $ modprobe bttv card=0x71
   $ modprobe dvb-bt8xx
   $ modprobe dst

The value 0x71 will override the PCI type detection for dvb-bt8xx,
which  is necessary for TwinHan cards. Omission of this parameter might result
in a system lockup.

If you're having an older card (blue color PCB) and card=0x71 locks up
your machine, try using 0x68, too. If that does not work, ask on the
mailing list.

The DST module takes a couple of useful parameters.

verbose takes values 0 to 4. These values control the verbosity level,
and can be used to debug also.

verbose=0 means complete disabling of messages
	1 only error messages are displayed
	2 notifications are also displayed
	3 informational messages are also displayed
	4 debug setting

dst_addons takes values 0 and 0x20. A value of 0 means it is a FTA card.
0x20 means it has a Conditional Access slot.

The autodetected values are determined by the cards 'response string'
which you can see in your logs e.g.

dst_get_device_id: Recognise [DSTMCI]

If you need to sent in bug reports on the dst, please do send in a complete
log with the verbose=4 module parameter. For general usage, the default setting
of verbose=1 is ideal.


4) Multiple cards
--------------------------

If you happen to be running multiple cards, it would be advisable to load
the bttv module with the card id. This would help to solve any module loading
problems that you might face.

For example, if you have a Twinhan and Clones card along with a FusionHDTV5 Lite

	$ modprobe bttv card=0x71 card=0x87

Here the order of the card id is important and should be the same as that of the
physical order of the cards. Here card=0x71 represents the Twinhan and clones
and card=0x87 represents Fusion HDTV5 Lite. These arguments can also be
specified in decimal, rather than hex:

	$ modprobe bttv card=113 card=135

Some examples of card-id's

Pinnacle Sat		0x5e  (94)
Nebula Digi TV		0x68  (104)
PC HDTV			0x70  (112)
Twinhan			0x71  (113)
FusionHDTV DVB-T Lite	0x80  (128)
FusionHDTV5 Lite	0x87  (135)

For a full list of card-id's, see the V4L Documentation within the kernel

If you have problems with this please do ask on the mailing list.
