      These statistics extend (and partially duplicate) statistics available

      Value of the `scope` attribute determines how statistics are
      aggregated. When aggregated for the entire device the statistics
      represent the total number of events since last explicit reset of
      the device (i.e. not a reconfiguration like changing queue count).
      When reported per-queue, however, the statistics may not add
      up to the total number of events, will only be reported for currently
      active objects, and will likely report the number of events since last
      reconfiguration.
