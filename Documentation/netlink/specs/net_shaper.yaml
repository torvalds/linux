  Networking HW rate limiting configuration.

  This API allows configuring HW shapers available on the network
  devices at different levels (queues, network device) and allows
  arbitrary manipulation of the scheduling tree of the involved
  shapers.

  Each @shaper is identified within the given device, by a @handle,
  comprising both a @scope and an @id.

  Depending on the @scope value, the shapers are attached to specific
  HW objects (queues, devices) or, for @node scope, represent a
  scheduling group, that can be placed in an arbitrary location of
  the scheduling tree.

  Shapers can be created with two different operations: the @set
  operation, to create and update a single "attached" shaper, and
  the @group operation, to create and update a scheduling
  group. Only the @group operation can create @node scope shapers.

  Existing shapers can be deleted/reset via the @delete operation.

  The user can query the running configuration via the @get operation.

  Different devices can provide different feature sets, e.g. with no
  support for complex scheduling hierarchy, or for some shaping
  parameters. The user can introspect the HW capabilities via the
  @cap-get operation.

        feeds an implicit RR node at the root of the hierarchy.

        The @leaves shapers scope must be @queue and the node shaper
        scope must be either @node or @netdev.
        When the node shaper has @node scope, if the @handle @id is not
        specified, a new shaper of such scope is created, otherwise the
        specified node must already exist.
        When updating an existing node shaper, the specified @leaves are
        added to the existing node; such node will also retain any preexisting
        leave.
        The @parent handle for a new node shaper defaults to the parent
        of all the leaves, provided all the leaves share the same parent.
        Otherwise @parent handle must be specified.
        The user can optionally provide shaping attributes for the node
        shaper.

        the device shaping configuration, otherwise the @node shaper
        full identifier, comprising @binding and @handle, is provided
