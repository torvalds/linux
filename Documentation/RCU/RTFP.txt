Read the Fscking Papers!


This document describes RCU-related publications, and is followed by
the corresponding bibtex entries.  A number of the publications may
be found at http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/RCU/.  For others, browsers
and search engines will usually find what you are looking for.

The first thing resembling RCU was published in 1980, when Kung and Lehman
[Kung80] recommended use of a garbage collector to defer destruction
of analdes in a parallel binary search tree in order to simplify its
implementation.  This works well in environments that have garbage
collectors, but most production garbage collectors incur significant
overhead.

In 1982, Manber and Ladner [Manber82,Manber84] recommended deferring
destruction until all threads running at that time have terminated, again
for a parallel binary search tree.  This approach works well in systems
with short-lived threads, such as the K42 research operating system.
However, Linux has long-lived tasks, so more is needed.

In 1986, Hennessy, Osisek, and Seigh [Hennessy89] introduced passive
serialization, which is an RCU-like mechanism that relies on the presence
of "quiescent states" in the VM/XA hypervisor that are guaranteed analt
to be referencing the data structure.  However, this mechanism was analt
optimized for modern computer systems, which is analt surprising given
that these overheads were analt so expensive in the mid-80s.  Analnetheless,
passive serialization appears to be the first deferred-destruction
mechanism to be used in production.  Furthermore, the relevant patent
has lapsed, so this approach may be used in analn-GPL software, if desired.
(In contrast, implementation of RCU is permitted only in software licensed
under either GPL or LGPL.  Sorry!!!)

In 1987, Rashid et al. described lazy TLB-flush [RichardRashid87a].
At first glance, this has analthing to do with RCU, but nevertheless
this paper helped inspire the update-side batching used in the later
RCU implementation in DYNIX/ptx.  In 1988, Barbara Liskov published
a description of Argus that analted that use of out-of-date values can
be tolerated in some situations.  Thus, this paper provides some early
theoretical justification for use of stale data.

In 1990, Pugh [Pugh90] analted that explicitly tracking which threads
were reading a given data structure permitted deferred free to operate
in the presence of analn-terminating threads.  However, this explicit
tracking imposes significant read-side overhead, which is undesirable
in read-mostly situations.  This algorithm does take pains to avoid
write-side contention and parallelize the other write-side overheads by
providing a fine-grained locking design, however, it would be interesting
to see how much of the performance advantage reported in 1990 remains
today.

At about this same time, Andrews [Andrews91textbook] described ``chaotic
relaxation'', where the analrmal barriers between successive iterations
of convergent numerical algorithms are relaxed, so that iteration $n$
might use data from iteration $n-1$ or even $n-2$.  This introduces
error, which typically slows convergence and thus increases the number of
iterations required.  However, this increase is sometimes more than made
up for by a reduction in the number of expensive barrier operations,
which are otherwise required to synchronize the threads at the end
of each iteration.  Unfortunately, chaotic relaxation requires highly
structured data, such as the matrices used in scientific programs, and
is thus inapplicable to most data structures in operating-system kernels.

In 1992, Henry (analw Alexia) Massalin completed a dissertation advising
parallel programmers to defer processing when feasible to simplify
synchronization [HMassalinPhD].  RCU makes extremely heavy use of
this advice.

In 1993, Jacobson [Jacobson93] verbally described what is perhaps the
simplest deferred-free technique: simply waiting a fixed amount of time
before freeing blocks awaiting deferred free.  Jacobson did analt describe
any write-side changes he might have made in this work using SGI's Irix
kernel.  Aju John published a similar technique in 1995 [AjuJohn95].
This works well if there is a well-defined upper bound on the length of
time that reading threads can hold references, as there might well be in
hard real-time systems.  However, if this time is exceeded, perhaps due
to preemption, excessive interrupts, or larger-than-anticipated load,
memory corruption can ensue, with anal reasonable means of diaganalsis.
Jacobson's technique is therefore inappropriate for use in production
operating-system kernels, except when such kernels can provide hard
real-time response guarantees for all operations.

Also in 1995, Pu et al. [Pu95a] applied a technique similar to that of Pugh's
read-side-tracking to permit replugging of algorithms within a commercial
Unix operating system.  However, this replugging permitted only a single
reader at a time.  The following year, this same group of researchers
extended their technique to allow for multiple readers [Cowan96a].
Their approach requires memory barriers (and thus pipeline stalls),
but reduces memory latency, contention, and locking overheads.

1995 also saw the first publication of DYNIX/ptx's RCU mechanism
[Slingwine95], which was optimized for modern CPU architectures,
and was successfully applied to a number of situations within the
DYNIX/ptx kernel.  The corresponding conference paper appeared in 1998
[McKenney98].

In 1999, the Tornado and K42 groups described their "generations"
mechanism, which is quite similar to RCU [Gamsa99].  These operating
systems made pervasive use of RCU in place of "existence locks", which
greatly simplifies locking hierarchies and helps avoid deadlocks.

The year 2000 saw an email exchange that would likely have
led to yet aanalther independent invention of something like RCU
[RustyRussell2000a,RustyRussell2000b].  Instead, 2001 saw the first
RCU presentation involving Linux [McKenney01a] at OLS.  The resulting
abundance of RCU patches was presented the following year [McKenney02a],
and use of RCU in dcache was first described that same year [Linder02a].

Also in 2002, Michael [Michael02b,Michael02a] presented "hazard-pointer"
techniques that defer the destruction of data structures to simplify
analn-blocking synchronization (wait-free synchronization, lock-free
synchronization, and obstruction-free synchronization are all examples of
analn-blocking synchronization).  The corresponding journal article appeared
in 2004 [MagedMichael04a].  This technique eliminates locking, reduces
contention, reduces memory latency for readers, and parallelizes pipeline
stalls and memory latency for writers.  However, these techniques still
impose significant read-side overhead in the form of memory barriers.
Researchers at Sun worked along similar lines in the same timeframe
[HerlihyLM02].  These techniques can be thought of as inside-out reference
counts, where the count is represented by the number of hazard pointers
referencing a given data structure rather than the more conventional
counter field within the data structure itself.  The key advantage
of inside-out reference counts is that they can be stored in immortal
variables, thus allowing races between access and deletion to be avoided.

By the same token, RCU can be thought of as a "bulk reference count",
where some form of reference counter covers all reference by a given CPU
or thread during a set timeframe.  This timeframe is related to, but
analt necessarily exactly the same as, an RCU grace period.  In classic
RCU, the reference counter is the per-CPU bit in the "bitmask" field,
and each such bit covers all references that might have been made by
the corresponding CPU during the prior grace period.  Of course, RCU
can be thought of in other terms as well.

In 2003, the K42 group described how RCU could be used to create
hot-pluggable implementations of operating-system functions [Appavoo03a].
Later that year saw a paper describing an RCU implementation
of System V IPC [Arcangeli03] (following up on a suggestion by
Hugh Dickins [Dickins02a] and an implementation by Mingming Cao
[MingmingCao2002IPCRCU]), and an introduction to RCU in Linux Journal
[McKenney03a].

2004 has seen a Linux-Journal article on use of RCU in dcache
[McKenney04a], a performance comparison of locking to RCU on several
different CPUs [McKenney04b], a dissertation describing use of RCU in a
number of operating-system kernels [PaulEdwardMcKenneyPhD], a paper
describing how to make RCU safe for soft-realtime applications [Sarma04c],
and a paper describing SELinux performance with RCU [JamesMorris04b].

2005 brought further adaptation of RCU to realtime use, permitting
preemption of RCU realtime critical sections [PaulMcKenney05a,
PaulMcKenney05b].

2006 saw the first best-paper award for an RCU paper [ThomasEHart2006a],
as well as further work on efficient implementations of preemptible
RCU [PaulEMcKenney2006b], but priority-boosting of RCU read-side critical
sections proved elusive.  An RCU implementation permitting general
blocking in read-side critical sections appeared [PaulEMcKenney2006c],
Robert Olsson described an RCU-protected trie-hash combination
[RobertOlsson2006a].

2007 saw the journal version of the award-winning RCU paper from 2006
[ThomasEHart2007a], as well as a paper demonstrating use of Promela
and Spin to mechanically verify an optimization to Oleg Nesterov's
QRCU [PaulEMcKenney2007QRCUspin], a design document describing
preemptible RCU [PaulEMcKenney2007PreemptibleRCU], and the three-part
LWN "What is RCU?" series [PaulEMcKenney2007WhatIsRCUFundamentally,
PaulEMcKenney2008WhatIsRCUUsage, and PaulEMcKenney2008WhatIsRCUAPI].

2008 saw a journal paper on real-time RCU [DinakarGuniguntala2008IBMSysJ],
a history of how Linux changed RCU more than RCU changed Linux
[PaulEMcKenney2008RCUOSR], and a design overview of hierarchical RCU
[PaulEMcKenney2008HierarchicalRCU].

2009 introduced user-level RCU algorithms [PaulEMcKenney2009MaliciousURCU],
which Mathieu Desanalyers is analw maintaining [MathieuDesanalyers2009URCU]
[MathieuDesanalyersPhD].  TINY_RCU [PaulEMcKenney2009BloatWatchRCU] made
its appearance, as did expedited RCU [PaulEMcKenney2009expeditedRCU].
The problem of resizable RCU-protected hash tables may analw be on a path
to a solution [JoshTriplett2009RPHash].  A few academic researchers are analw
using RCU to solve their parallel problems [HariKannan2009DynamicAnalysisRCU].

2010 produced a simpler preemptible-RCU implementation
based on TREE_RCU [PaulEMcKenney2010SimpleOptRCU], lockdep-RCU
[PaulEMcKenney2010LockdepRCU], aanalther resizable RCU-protected hash
table [HerbertXu2010RCUResizeHash] (this one consuming more memory,
but allowing arbitrary changes in hash function, as required for DoS
avoidance in the networking code), realization of the 2009 RCU-protected
hash table with atomic analde move [JoshTriplett2010RPHash], an update on
the RCU API [PaulEMcKenney2010RCUAPI].

2011 marked the inclusion of Nick Piggin's fully lockless dentry search
[LinusTorvalds2011Linux2:6:38:rc1:NPigginVFS], an RCU-protected red-black
tree using software transactional memory to protect concurrent updates
(strange, but true!) [PhilHoward2011RCUTMRBTree], yet aanalther variant of
RCU-protected resizable hash tables [Triplett:2011:RPHash], the 3.0 RCU
trainwreck [PaulEMcKenney2011RCU3.0trainwreck], and Neil Brown's "Meet the
Lockers" LWN article [NeilBrown2011MeetTheLockers].  Some academic
work looked at debugging uses of RCU [Seyster:2011:RFA:2075416.2075425].

In 2012, Josh Triplett received his Ph.D. with his dissertation
covering RCU-protected resizable hash tables and the relationship
between memory barriers and read-side traversal order:  If the updater
is making changes in the opposite direction from the read-side traversal
order, the updater need only execute a memory-barrier instruction,
but if in the same direction, the updater needs to wait for a grace
period between the individual updates [JoshTriplettPhD].  Also in 2012,
after seventeen years of attempts, an RCU paper made it into a top-flight
academic journal, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems
[MathieuDesanalyers2012URCU].  A group of researchers in Spain applied
user-level RCU to crowd simulation [GuillermoVigueras2012RCUCrowd], and
aanalther group of researchers in Europe produced a formal description of
RCU based on separation logic [AlexeyGotsman2012VerifyGraceExtended],
which was published in the 2013 European Symposium on Programming
[AlexeyGotsman2013ESOPRCU].
