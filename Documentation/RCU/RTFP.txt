This document describes RCU-related publications, and is followed by
the corresponding bibtex entries.  A number of the publications may
be found at http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/RCU/.

The first thing resembling RCU was published in 1980, when Kung and Lehman
[Kung80] recommended use of a garbage collector to defer destruction
of nodes in a parallel binary search tree in order to simplify its
implementation.  This works well in environments that have garbage
collectors, but most production garbage collectors incur significant
overhead.

In 1982, Manber and Ladner [Manber82,Manber84] recommended deferring
destruction until all threads running at that time have terminated, again
for a parallel binary search tree.  This approach works well in systems
with short-lived threads, such as the K42 research operating system.
However, Linux has long-lived tasks, so more is needed.

In 1986, Hennessy, Osisek, and Seigh [Hennessy89] introduced passive
serialization, which is an RCU-like mechanism that relies on the presence
of "quiescent states" in the VM/XA hypervisor that are guaranteed not
to be referencing the data structure.  However, this mechanism was not
optimized for modern computer systems, which is not surprising given
that these overheads were not so expensive in the mid-80s.  Nonetheless,
passive serialization appears to be the first deferred-destruction
mechanism to be used in production.  Furthermore, the relevant patent
has lapsed, so this approach may be used in non-GPL software, if desired.
(In contrast, implementation of RCU is permitted only in software licensed
under either GPL or LGPL.  Sorry!!!)

In 1990, Pugh [Pugh90] noted that explicitly tracking which threads
were reading a given data structure permitted deferred free to operate
in the presence of non-terminating threads.  However, this explicit
tracking imposes significant read-side overhead, which is undesirable
in read-mostly situations.  This algorithm does take pains to avoid
write-side contention and parallelize the other write-side overheads by
providing a fine-grained locking design, however, it would be interesting
to see how much of the performance advantage reported in 1990 remains
in 2004.

At about this same time, Adams [Adams91] described ``chaotic relaxation'',
where the normal barriers between successive iterations of convergent
numerical algorithms are relaxed, so that iteration $n$ might use
data from iteration $n-1$ or even $n-2$.  This introduces error,
which typically slows convergence and thus increases the number of
iterations required.  However, this increase is sometimes more than made
up for by a reduction in the number of expensive barrier operations,
which are otherwise required to synchronize the threads at the end
of each iteration.  Unfortunately, chaotic relaxation requires highly
structured data, such as the matrices used in scientific programs, and
is thus inapplicable to most data structures in operating-system kernels.

In 1992, Henry (now Alexia) Massalin completed a dissertation advising
parallel programmers to defer processing when feasible to simplify
synchronization.  RCU makes extremely heavy use of this advice.

In 1993, Jacobson [Jacobson93] verbally described what is perhaps the
simplest deferred-free technique: simply waiting a fixed amount of time
before freeing blocks awaiting deferred free.  Jacobson did not describe
any write-side changes he might have made in this work using SGI's Irix
kernel.  Aju John published a similar technique in 1995 [AjuJohn95].
This works well if there is a well-defined upper bound on the length of
time that reading threads can hold references, as there might well be in
hard real-time systems.  However, if this time is exceeded, perhaps due
to preemption, excessive interrupts, or larger-than-anticipated load,
memory corruption can ensue, with no reasonable means of diagnosis.
Jacobson's technique is therefore inappropriate for use in production
operating-system kernels, except when such kernels can provide hard
real-time response guarantees for all operations.

Also in 1995, Pu et al. [Pu95a] applied a technique similar to that of Pugh's
read-side-tracking to permit replugging of algorithms within a commercial
Unix operating system.  However, this replugging permitted only a single
reader at a time.  The following year, this same group of researchers
extended their technique to allow for multiple readers [Cowan96a].
Their approach requires memory barriers (and thus pipeline stalls),
but reduces memory latency, contention, and locking overheads.

1995 also saw the first publication of DYNIX/ptx's RCU mechanism
[Slingwine95], which was optimized for modern CPU architectures,
and was successfully applied to a number of situations within the
DYNIX/ptx kernel.  The corresponding conference paper appeared in 1998
[McKenney98].

In 1999, the Tornado and K42 groups described their "generations"
mechanism, which quite similar to RCU [Gamsa99].  These operating systems
made pervasive use of RCU in place of "existence locks", which greatly
simplifies locking hierarchies.

2001 saw the first RCU presentation involving Linux [McKenney01a]
at OLS.  The resulting abundance of RCU patches was presented the
following year [McKenney02a], and use of RCU in dcache was first
described that same year [Linder02a].

Also in 2002, Michael [Michael02b,Michael02a] presented "hazard-pointer"
techniques that defer the destruction of data structures to simplify
non-blocking synchronization (wait-free synchronization, lock-free
synchronization, and obstruction-free synchronization are all examples of
non-blocking synchronization).  In particular, this technique eliminates
locking, reduces contention, reduces memory latency for readers, and
parallelizes pipeline stalls and memory latency for writers.  However,
these techniques still impose significant read-side overhead in the
form of memory barriers.  Researchers at Sun worked along similar lines
in the same timeframe [HerlihyLM02].  These techniques can be thought
of as inside-out reference counts, where the count is represented by the
number of hazard pointers referencing a given data structure (rather than
the more conventional counter field within the data structure itself).

By the same token, RCU can be thought of as a "bulk reference count",
where some form of reference counter covers all reference by a given CPU
or thread during a set timeframe.  This timeframe is related to, but
not necessarily exactly the same as, an RCU grace period.  In classic
RCU, the reference counter is the per-CPU bit in the "bitmask" field,
and each such bit covers all references that might have been made by
the corresponding CPU during the prior grace period.  Of course, RCU
can be thought of in other terms as well.

In 2003, the K42 group described how RCU could be used to create
hot-pluggable implementations of operating-system functions [Appavoo03a].
Later that year saw a paper describing an RCU implementation of System
V IPC [Arcangeli03], and an introduction to RCU in Linux Journal
[McKenney03a].

2004 has seen a Linux-Journal article on use of RCU in dcache
[McKenney04a], a performance comparison of locking to RCU on several
different CPUs [McKenney04b], a dissertation describing use of RCU in a
number of operating-system kernels [PaulEdwardMcKenneyPhD], a paper
describing how to make RCU safe for soft-realtime applications [Sarma04c],
and a paper describing SELinux performance with RCU [JamesMorris04b].

2005 brought further adaptation of RCU to realtime use, permitting
preemption of RCU realtime critical sections [PaulMcKenney05a,
PaulMcKenney05b].

2006 saw the first best-paper award for an RCU paper [ThomasEHart2006a],
as well as further work on efficient implementations of preemptible
RCU [PaulEMcKenney2006b], but priority-boosting of RCU read-side critical
sections proved elusive.  An RCU implementation permitting general
blocking in read-side critical sections appeared [PaulEMcKenney2006c],
Robert Olsson described an RCU-protected trie-hash combination
[RobertOlsson2006a].

2007 saw the journal version of the award-winning RCU paper from 2006
[ThomasEHart2007a], as well as a paper demonstrating use of Promela
and Spin to mechanically verify an optimization to Oleg Nesterov's
QRCU [PaulEMcKenney2007QRCUspin], a design document describing
preemptible RCU [PaulEMcKenney2007PreemptibleRCU], and the three-part
LWN "What is RCU?" series [PaulEMcKenney2007WhatIsRCUFundamentally,
PaulEMcKenney2008WhatIsRCUUsage, and PaulEMcKenney2008WhatIsRCUAPI].

2008 saw a journal paper on real-time RCU [DinakarGuniguntala2008IBMSysJ],
a history of how Linux changed RCU more than RCU changed Linux
[PaulEMcKenney2008RCUOSR], and a design overview of hierarchical RCU
[PaulEMcKenney2008HierarchicalRCU].

2009 introduced user-level RCU algorithms [PaulEMcKenney2009MaliciousURCU],
which Mathieu Desnoyers is now maintaining [MathieuDesnoyers2009URCU]
[MathieuDesnoyersPhD].  TINY_RCU [PaulEMcKenney2009BloatWatchRCU] made
its appearance, as did expedited RCU [PaulEMcKenney2009expeditedRCU].
The problem of resizeable RCU-protected hash tables may now be on a path
to a solution [JoshTriplett2009RPHash].
