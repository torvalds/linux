Linux Kernel patch sumbittal checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some basic things that developers should do if they want to see their
kernel patch submissions accepted more quickly.

These are all above and beyond the documentation that is provided in
Documentation/SubmittingPatches and elsewhere regarding submitting Linux
kernel patches.



1: Builds cleanly with applicable or modified CONFIG options =y, =m, and
   =n.  No gcc warnings/errors, no linker warnings/errors.

2: Passes allnoconfig, allmodconfig

3: Builds on multiple CPU architectures by using local cross-compile tools
   or something like PLM at OSDL.

4: ppc64 is a good architecture for cross-compilation checking because it
   tends to use `unsigned long' for 64-bit quantities.

5: Matches kernel coding style(!)

6: Any new or modified CONFIG options don't muck up the config menu.

7: All new Kconfig options have help text.

8: Has been carefully reviewed with respect to relevant Kconfig
   combinations.  This is very hard to get right with testing -- brainpower
   pays off here.

9: Check cleanly with sparse.

10: Use 'make checkstack' and 'make namespacecheck' and fix any problems
    that they find.  Note: checkstack does not point out problems explicitly,
    but any one function that uses more than 512 bytes on the stack is a
    candidate for change.

11: Include kernel-doc to document global kernel APIs.  (Not required for
    static functions, but OK there also.) Use 'make htmldocs' or 'make
    mandocs' to check the kernel-doc and fix any issues.

12: Has been tested with CONFIG_PREEMPT, CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT,
    CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES,
    CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK, CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP all simultaneously
    enabled.

13: Has been build- and runtime tested with and without CONFIG_SMP and
    CONFIG_PREEMPT.

14: If the patch affects IO/Disk, etc: has been tested with and without
    CONFIG_LBD.

15: All codepaths have been exercised with all lockdep features enabled.

16: All new /proc entries are documented under Documentation/

17: All new kernel boot parameters are documented in
    Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt.

18: All new module parameters are documented with MODULE_PARM_DESC()

19: All new userspace interfaces are documented in Documentation/ABI/.
    See Documentation/ABI/README for more information.

20: Check that it all passes `make headers_check'.

21: Has been checked with injection of at least slab and page-allocation
    fauilures.  See Documentation/fault-injection/.

    If the new code is substantial, addition of subsystem-specific fault
    injection might be appropriate.

22: Newly-added code has been compiled with `gcc -W' (use "make
    EXTRA_CFLAGS=-W").  This will generate lots of noise, but is good for
    finding bugs like "warning: comparison between signed and unsigned".

23: Tested after it has been merged into the -mm patchset to make sure
    that it still works with all of the other queued patches and various
    changes in the VM, VFS, and other subsystems.

24: Avoid whitespace damage such as indenting with spaces or whitespace
    at the end of lines.  You can test this by feeding the patch to
    "git apply --check --whitespace=error-all"
