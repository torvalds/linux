The cpufreq-nforce2 driver changes the FSB on nVidia nForce2 plattforms.

This works better than on other plattforms, because the FSB of the CPU
can be controlled independently from the PCI/AGP clock.

The module has two options:

	fid: 	 multiplier * 10 (for example 8.5 = 85)
	min_fsb: minimum FSB

If not set, fid is calculated from the current CPU speed and the FSB.
min_fsb defaults to FSB at boot time - 50 MHz.

IMPORTANT: The available range is limited downwards!
           Also the minimum available FSB can differ, for systems 
           booting with 200 MHz, 150 should always work.
