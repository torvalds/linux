    Problems?
 
 Q: You have VT82C586B on the motherboard, but not in the listing. 
 
 A: Go to your BIOS setup, section PCI devices or similar.
    Turn USB support on, and try again. 

 Q: No error messages, but still i2c doesn't seem to work.

 A: This can happen. This driver uses the pins VIA recommends in their
    datasheets, but there are several ways the motherboard manufacturer
    can actually wire the lines.
