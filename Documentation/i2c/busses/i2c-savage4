Description
-----------

The Savage4 chips contain two I2C interfaces (aka a I2C 'master'
or 'host'). 

The first interface is used for DDC (Data Display Channel) which is a
serial channel through the VGA monitor connector to a DDC-compliant
monitor. This interface is defined by the Video Electronics Standards
Association (VESA). The standards are available for purchase at
http://www.vesa.org . The DDC bus is not yet supported because its register
is not directly memory-mapped.

The second interface is a general-purpose I2C bus. This is the only
interface supported by the driver at the moment.
