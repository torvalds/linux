Module Parameters
-----------------

* bus_speed (unsigned int)
Allows changing of the bus speed.  Normally, the bus speed is set by the BIOS
and never needs to be changed.  However, some SMBus analyzers are too slow for
monitoring the bus during debug, thus the need for this module parameter.
Specify the bus speed in kHz.
Available bus frequency settings:
  0  no change
  80 kHz
  100 kHz
  400 kHz
  1000 kHz


Description
-----------

The S12xx series of SOCs have a pair of integrated SMBus 2.0 controllers
targeted primarily at the microserver and storage markets.

The S12xx series contain a pair of PCI functions.  An output of lspci will show
something similar to the following:

  00:13.0 System peripheral: Intel Corporation Centerton SMBus 2.0 Controller 0
  00:13.1 System peripheral: Intel Corporation Centerton SMBus 2.0 Controller 1
