Module Parameters
-----------------

* force = [1|0] Forcibly enable the SIS630. DANGEROUS!
		This can be interesting for chipsets not named
		above to check if it works for you chipset, but DANGEROUS!

* high_clock = [1|0] Forcibly set Host Master Clock to 56KHz (default,
			what your BIOS use). DANGEROUS! This should be a bit
			faster, but freeze some systems (i.e. my Laptop).


Description
-----------

This SMBus only driver is known to work on motherboards with the above
named chipsets.

If you see something like this:

00:00.0 Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 630 Host (rev 31)
00:01.0 ISA bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 85C503/5513

or like this:

00:00.0 Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 730 Host (rev 02)
00:01.0 ISA bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 85C503/5513

in your 'lspci' output , then this driver is for your chipset.
