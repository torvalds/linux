Supported adapters:
  * nForce2 MCP                10de:0064 
  * nForce2 Ultra 400 MCP      10de:0084 
  * nForce3 Pro150 MCP         10de:00D4

  * nForce4 MCP	       	       10de:0052

Datasheet: not publically available, but seems to be similar to the
           AMD-8111 SMBus 2.0 adapter.

Description
-----------

i2c-nforce2 is a driver for the SMBuses included in the nVidia nForce2 MCP.

If your 'lspci -v' listing shows something like the following,

00:01.1 SMBus: nVidia Corporation: Unknown device 0064 (rev a2)
        Subsystem: Asustek Computer, Inc.: Unknown device 0c11
        Flags: 66Mhz, fast devsel, IRQ 5
        I/O ports at c000 [size=32]
        Capabilities: <available only to root>

then this driver should support the SMBuses of your motherboard.


Notes
-----

The SMBus adapter in the nForce2 chipset seems to be very similar to the
SMBus 2.0 adapter in the AMD-8111 southbridge. However, I could only get
the driver to work with direct I/O access, which is different to the EC
interface of the AMD-8111. Tested on Asus A7N8X. The ACPI DSDT table of the
Asus A7N8X lists two SMBuses, both of which are supported by this driver.
