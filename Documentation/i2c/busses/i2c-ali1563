Description
-----------

This is the driver for the SMB Host controller on Acer Labs Inc. (ALI)
M1563 South Bridge.

For an overview of these chips see http://www.acerlabs.com

The M1563 southbridge is deceptively similar to the M1533, with a few
notable exceptions. One of those happens to be the fact they upgraded the
i2c core to be SMBus 2.0 compliant, and happens to be almost identical to
the i2c controller found in the Intel 801 south bridges.

Features
--------

This driver controls the SMB Host only. This driver does not use
interrupts.
