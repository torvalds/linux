Module Parameters
-----------------

None.


Description
-----------

The ICH (properly known as the 82801AA), ICH0 (82801AB), ICH2 (82801BA),
ICH3 (82801CA/CAM) and later devices are Intel chips that are a part of
Intel's '810' chipset for Celeron-based PCs, '810E' chipset for
Pentium-based PCs, '815E' chipset, and others.

The ICH chips contain at least SEVEN separate PCI functions in TWO logical
PCI devices. An output of lspci will show something similar to the
following:

  00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2418 (rev 01)
  00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2410 (rev 01)
  00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2411 (rev 01)
  00:1f.2 USB Controller: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2412 (rev 01)
  00:1f.3 Unknown class [0c05]: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2413 (rev 01)

The SMBus controller is function 3 in device 1f. Class 0c05 is SMBus Serial
Controller.

If you do NOT see the 24x3 device at function 3, and you can't figure out
any way in the BIOS to enable it,

The ICH chips are quite similar to Intel's PIIX4 chip, at least in the
SMBus controller.

See the file i2c-piix4 for some additional information.


Process Call Support
--------------------

Not supported.


I2C Block Read Support
----------------------

Not supported at the moment.


SMBus 2.0 Support
-----------------

The 82801DB (ICH4) and later chips support several SMBus 2.0 features.
