Description 
----------- 

WARNING: If you have an '810' or '815' motherboard, your standard I2C
temperature sensors are most likely on the 801's I2C bus. You want the
i2c-i801 driver for those, not this driver.

Now for the i2c-i810...

The GMCH chip contains two I2C interfaces.

The first interface is used for DDC (Data Display Channel) which is a
serial channel through the VGA monitor connector to a DDC-compliant
monitor. This interface is defined by the Video Electronics Standards
Association (VESA). The standards are available for purchase at
http://www.vesa.org .

The second interface is a general-purpose I2C bus. It may be connected to a
TV-out chip such as the BT869 or possibly to a digital flat-panel display.

Features
-------- 

Both busses use the i2c-algo-bit driver for 'bit banging'
and support for specific transactions is provided by i2c-algo-bit.

Issues
------

If you enable bus testing in i2c-algo-bit (insmod i2c-algo-bit bit_test=1),
the test may fail; if so, the i2c-i810 driver won't be inserted. However,
we think this has been fixed.
