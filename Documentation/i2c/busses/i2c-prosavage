Description
-----------

The Savage4 chips contain two I2C interfaces (aka a I2C 'master' or
'host'). 

The first interface is used for DDC (Data Display Channel) which is a
serial channel through the VGA monitor connector to a DDC-compliant
monitor. This interface is defined by the Video Electronics Standards
Association (VESA). The standards are available for purchase at
http://www.vesa.org . The second interface is a general-purpose I2C bus.

Usefull for gaining access to the TV Encoder chips.
