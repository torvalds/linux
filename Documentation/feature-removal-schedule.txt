The following is a list of files and features that are going to be
removed in the kernel source tree.  Every entry should contain what
exactly is going away, why it is happening, and who is going to be doing
the work.  When the feature is removed from the kernel, it should also
be removed from this file.

---------------------------

What:	old static regulatory information and ieee80211_regdom module parameter
When:	2.6.29
Why:	The old regulatory infrastructure has been replaced with a new one
	which does not require statically defined regulatory domains. We do
	not want to keep static regulatory domains in the kernel due to the
	the dynamic nature of regulatory law and localization. We kept around
	the old static definitions for the regulatory domains of:
		* US
		* JP
		* EU
	and used by default the US when CONFIG_WIRELESS_OLD_REGULATORY was
	set. We also kept around the ieee80211_regdom module parameter in case
	some applications were relying on it. Changing regulatory domains
	can now be done instead by using nl80211, as is done with iw.
Who:	Luis R. Rodriguez <lrodriguez@atheros.com>

---------------------------

What:	dev->power.power_state
When:	July 2007
Why:	Broken design for runtime control over driver power states, confusing
	driver-internal runtime power management with:  mechanisms to support
	system-wide sleep state transitions; event codes that distinguish
	different phases of swsusp "sleep" transitions; and userspace policy
	inputs.  This framework was never widely used, and most attempts to
	use it were broken.  Drivers should instead be exposing domain-specific
	interfaces either to kernel or to userspace.
Who:	Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz>

---------------------------

What:	Video4Linux API 1 ioctls and video_decoder.h from Video devices.
When:	December 2008
Files:	include/linux/video_decoder.h include/linux/videodev.h
Check:	include/linux/video_decoder.h include/linux/videodev.h
Why:	V4L1 AP1 was replaced by V4L2 API during migration from 2.4 to 2.6
	series. The old API have lots of drawbacks and don't provide enough
	means to work with all video and audio standards. The newer API is
	already available on the main drivers and should be used instead.
	Newer drivers should use v4l_compat_translate_ioctl function to handle
	old calls, replacing to newer ones.
	Decoder iocts are using internally to allow video drivers to
	communicate with video decoders. This should also be improved to allow
	V4L2 calls being translated into compatible internal ioctls.
	Compatibility ioctls will be provided, for a while, via 
	v4l1-compat module. 
Who:	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@infradead.org>

---------------------------

What:	old tuner-3036 i2c driver
When:	2.6.28
Why:	This driver is for VERY old i2c-over-parallel port teletext receiver
	boxes. Rather then spending effort on converting this driver to V4L2,
	and since it is extremely unlikely that anyone still uses one of these
	devices, it was decided to drop it.
Who:	Hans Verkuil <hverkuil@xs4all.nl>
	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@infradead.org>

 ---------------------------

What:   V4L2 dpc7146 driver
When:   2.6.28
Why:    Old driver for the dpc7146 demonstration board that is no longer
	relevant. The last time this was tested on actual hardware was
	probably around 2002. Since this is a driver for a demonstration
	board the decision was made to remove it rather than spending a
	lot of effort continually updating this driver to stay in sync
	with the latest internal V4L2 or I2C API.
Who:    Hans Verkuil <hverkuil@xs4all.nl>
	Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@infradead.org>

---------------------------

What:	PCMCIA control ioctl (needed for pcmcia-cs [cardmgr, cardctl])
When:	November 2005
Files:	drivers/pcmcia/: pcmcia_ioctl.c
Why:	With the 16-bit PCMCIA subsystem now behaving (almost) like a
	normal hotpluggable bus, and with it using the default kernel
	infrastructure (hotplug, driver core, sysfs) keeping the PCMCIA
	control ioctl needed by cardmgr and cardctl from pcmcia-cs is
	unnecessary, and makes further cleanups and integration of the
	PCMCIA subsystem into the Linux kernel device driver model more
	difficult. The features provided by cardmgr and cardctl are either
	handled by the kernel itself now or are available in the new
	pcmciautils package available at
	http://kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/pcmcia/
Who:	Dominik Brodowski <linux@brodo.de>

---------------------------

What:	sys_sysctl
When:	September 2010
Option: CONFIG_SYSCTL_SYSCALL
Why:	The same information is available in a more convenient from
	/proc/sys, and none of the sysctl variables appear to be
	important performance wise.

	Binary sysctls are a long standing source of subtle kernel
	bugs and security issues.

	When I looked several months ago all I could find after
	searching several distributions were 5 user space programs and
	glibc (which falls back to /proc/sys) using this syscall.

	The man page for sysctl(2) documents it as unusable for user
	space programs.

	sysctl(2) is not generally ABI compatible to a 32bit user
	space application on a 64bit and a 32bit kernel.

	For the last several months the policy has been no new binary
	sysctls and no one has put forward an argument to use them.

	Binary sysctls issues seem to keep happening appearing so
	properly deprecating them (with a warning to user space) and a
	2 year grace warning period will mean eventually we can kill
	them and end the pain.

	In the mean time individual binary sysctls can be dealt with
	in a piecewise fashion.

---------------------------

What:	remove EXPORT_SYMBOL(kernel_thread)
When:	August 2006
Files:	arch/*/kernel/*_ksyms.c
Check:	kernel_thread
Why:	kernel_thread is a low-level implementation detail.  Drivers should
        use the <linux/kthread.h> API instead which shields them from
	implementation details and provides a higherlevel interface that
	prevents bugs and code duplication
Who:	Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>

---------------------------

What:   eepro100 network driver
When:   January 2007
Why:    replaced by the e100 driver
Who:    Adrian Bunk <bunk@stusta.de>

---------------------------

What:	Unused EXPORT_SYMBOL/EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL exports
	(temporary transition config option provided until then)
	The transition config option will also be removed at the same time.
When:	before 2.6.19
Why:	Unused symbols are both increasing the size of the kernel binary
	and are often a sign of "wrong API"
Who:	Arjan van de Ven <arjan@linux.intel.com>

---------------------------

What:	PHYSDEVPATH, PHYSDEVBUS, PHYSDEVDRIVER in the uevent environment
When:	October 2008
Why:	The stacking of class devices makes these values misleading and
	inconsistent.
	Class devices should not carry any of these properties, and bus
	devices have SUBSYTEM and DRIVER as a replacement.
Who:	Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@suse.de>

---------------------------

What:	ACPI procfs interface
When:	July 2008
Why:	ACPI sysfs conversion should be finished by January 2008.
	ACPI procfs interface will be removed in July 2008 so that
	there is enough time for the user space to catch up.
Who:	Zhang Rui <rui.zhang@intel.com>

---------------------------

What:	/proc/acpi/button
When:	August 2007
Why:	/proc/acpi/button has been replaced by events to the input layer
	since 2.6.20.
Who:	Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com>

---------------------------

What:	/proc/acpi/event
When:	February 2008
Why:	/proc/acpi/event has been replaced by events via the input layer
	and netlink since 2.6.23.
Who:	Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com>

---------------------------

What: libata spindown skipping and warning
When: Dec 2008
Why:  Some halt(8) implementations synchronize caches for and spin
      down libata disks because libata didn't use to spin down disk on
      system halt (only synchronized caches).
      Spin down on system halt is now implemented.  sysfs node
      /sys/class/scsi_disk/h:c:i:l/manage_start_stop is present if
      spin down support is available.
      Because issuing spin down command to an already spun down disk
      makes some disks spin up just to spin down again, libata tracks
      device spindown status to skip the extra spindown command and
      warn about it.
      This is to give userspace tools the time to get updated and will
      be removed after userspace is reasonably updated.
Who:  Tejun Heo <htejun@gmail.com>

---------------------------

What:	i386/x86_64 bzImage symlinks
When:	April 2010

Why:	The i386/x86_64 merge provides a symlink to the old bzImage
	location so not yet updated user space tools, e.g. package
	scripts, do not break.
Who:	Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

---------------------------

What (Why):
	- include/linux/netfilter_ipv4/ipt_TOS.h ipt_tos.h header files
	  (superseded by xt_TOS/xt_tos target & match)

	- "forwarding" header files like ipt_mac.h in
	  include/linux/netfilter_ipv4/ and include/linux/netfilter_ipv6/

	- xt_CONNMARK match revision 0
	  (superseded by xt_CONNMARK match revision 1)

	- xt_MARK target revisions 0 and 1
	  (superseded by xt_MARK match revision 2)

	- xt_connmark match revision 0
	  (superseded by xt_connmark match revision 1)

	- xt_conntrack match revision 0
	  (superseded by xt_conntrack match revision 1)

	- xt_iprange match revision 0,
	  include/linux/netfilter_ipv4/ipt_iprange.h
	  (superseded by xt_iprange match revision 1)

	- xt_mark match revision 0
	  (superseded by xt_mark match revision 1)

When:	January 2009 or Linux 2.7.0, whichever comes first
Why:	Superseded by newer revisions or modules
Who:	Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@computergmbh.de>

---------------------------

What:	b43 support for firmware revision < 410
When:	July 2008
Why:	The support code for the old firmware hurts code readability/maintainability
	and slightly hurts runtime performance. Bugfixes for the old firmware
	are not provided by Broadcom anymore.
Who:	Michael Buesch <mb@bu3sch.de>

---------------------------

What:	init_mm export
When:	2.6.26
Why:	Not used in-tree. The current out-of-tree users used it to
	work around problems in the CPA code which should be resolved
	by now. One usecase was described to provide verification code
	of the CPA operation. That's a good idea in general, but such
	code / infrastructure should be in the kernel and not in some
	out-of-tree driver.
Who:	Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

----------------------------

What:	usedac i386 kernel parameter
When:	2.6.27
Why:	replaced by allowdac and no dac combination
Who:	Glauber Costa <gcosta@redhat.com>

---------------------------

What:	old style serial driver for ColdFire (CONFIG_SERIAL_COLDFIRE)
When:	2.6.28
Why:	This driver still uses the old interface and has been replaced
	by CONFIG_SERIAL_MCF.
Who:	Sebastian Siewior <sebastian@breakpoint.cc>

---------------------------

What:	/sys/o2cb symlink
When:	January 2010
Why:	/sys/fs/o2cb is the proper location for this information - /sys/o2cb
	exists as a symlink for backwards compatibility for old versions of
	ocfs2-tools. 2 years should be sufficient time to phase in new versions
	which know to look in /sys/fs/o2cb.
Who:	ocfs2-devel@oss.oracle.com

---------------------------

What:	SCTP_GET_PEER_ADDRS_NUM_OLD, SCTP_GET_PEER_ADDRS_OLD,
	SCTP_GET_LOCAL_ADDRS_NUM_OLD, SCTP_GET_LOCAL_ADDRS_OLD
When: 	June 2009
Why:    A newer version of the options have been introduced in 2005 that
	removes the limitions of the old API.  The sctp library has been
        converted to use these new options at the same time.  Any user
	space app that directly uses the old options should convert to using
	the new options.
Who:	Vlad Yasevich <vladislav.yasevich@hp.com>

---------------------------

What:	CONFIG_THERMAL_HWMON
When:	January 2009
Why:	This option was introduced just to allow older lm-sensors userspace
	to keep working over the upgrade to 2.6.26. At the scheduled time of
	removal fixed lm-sensors (2.x or 3.x) should be readily available.
Who:	Rene Herman <rene.herman@gmail.com>

---------------------------

What:	Code that is now under CONFIG_WIRELESS_EXT_SYSFS
	(in net/core/net-sysfs.c)
When:	After the only user (hal) has seen a release with the patches
	for enough time, probably some time in 2010.
Why:	Over 1K .text/.data size reduction, data is available in other
	ways (ioctls)
Who:	Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>

---------------------------

What: CONFIG_NF_CT_ACCT
When: 2.6.29
Why:  Accounting can now be enabled/disabled without kernel recompilation.
      Currently used only to set a default value for a feature that is also
      controlled by a kernel/module/sysfs/sysctl parameter.
Who:  Krzysztof Piotr Oledzki <ole@ans.pl>

---------------------------

What: ide-scsi (BLK_DEV_IDESCSI)
When: 2.6.29
Why:  The 2.6 kernel supports direct writing to ide CD drives, which
      eliminates the need for ide-scsi. The new method is more
      efficient in every way.
Who:  FUJITA Tomonori <fujita.tomonori@lab.ntt.co.jp>
