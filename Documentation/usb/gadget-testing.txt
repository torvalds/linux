The ECM function provides these attributes in its function directory:

	ifname		- network device interface name associated with this
			function instance
	qmult		- queue length multiplier for high and super speed
	host_addr	- MAC address of host's end of this
			Ethernet over USB link
	dev_addr	- MAC address of device's end of this
			Ethernet over USB link

and after creating the functions/ecm.<instance name> they contain default
values: qmult is 5, dev_addr and host_addr are randomly selected.
Except for ifname they can be written to until the function is linked to a
configuration. The ifname is read-only and contains the name of the interface
which was assigned by the net core, e. g. usb0.

The function directory is intentionally empty and not modifiable.

After creating the directory there is a new instance (a "device") of FunctionFS
available in the system. Once a "device" is available, the user should follow
the standard procedure for using FunctionFS (mount it, run the userspace
process which implements the function proper). The gadget should be enabled
by writing a suitable string to usb_gadget/<gadget>/UDC.

Testing the FFS function
------------------------

On the device: start the function's userspace daemon, enable the gadget
On the host: use the USB function provided by the device

6. HID function
===============

The function is provided by usb_f_hid.ko module.

Function-specific configfs interface
------------------------------------

The function name to use when creating the function directory is "hid".
The HID function provides these attributes in its function directory:

	report_desc	- data to be used in HID reports, except data
			passed with /dev/hidg<X>
	report_length	- HID report length
	subclass	- HID subclass to use

For a keyboard the protocol and the subclass are 1, the report_length is 8,
while the report_desc is:

$ hd my_report_desc
00000000  05 01 09 06 a1 01 05 07  19 e0 29 e7 15 00 25 01  |..........)...%.|

00000020  05 08 19 01 29 05 91 02  95 01 75 03 91 03 95 06  |....).....u.....|
00000030  75 08 15 00 25 65 05 07  19 00 29 65 81 00 c0     |u...%e....)e...|
0000003f

Such a sequence of bytes can be stored to the attribute with echo:

$ echo -ne \\x05\\x01\\x09\\x06\\xa1.....

Testing the HID function
------------------------

Device:
- create the gadget
- connect the gadget to a host, preferably not the one used
to control the gadget
- run a program which writes to /dev/hidg<N>, e.g.
a userspace program found in Documentation/usb/gadget_hid.txt:

$ ./hid_gadget_test /dev/hidg0 keyboard

Host:
- observe the keystrokes from the gadget

8. MASS STORAGE function
========================

The function is provided by usb_f_mass_storage.ko module.

Function-specific configfs interface
------------------------------------

The function name to use when creating the function directory is "mass_storage".
The MASS STORAGE function provides these attributes in its directory:
files:

	stall		- Set to permit function to halt bulk endpoints.
			Disabled on some USB devices known not to work
			correctly. You should set it to true.
	num_buffers	- Number of pipeline buffers. Valid numbers
			are 2..4. Available only if
			CONFIG_USB_GADGET_DEBUG_FILES is set.

and a default lun.0 directory corresponding to SCSI LUN #0.

A new lun can be added with mkdir:

$ mkdir functions/mass_storage.0/partition.5

Lun numbering does not have to be continuous, except for lun #0 which is
created by default. A maximum of 8 luns can be specified and they all must be
named following the <name>.<number> scheme. The numbers can be 0..8.
Probably a good convention is to name the luns "lun.<number>",
although it is not mandatory.

In each lun directory there are the following attribute files:

	file		- The path to the backing file for the LUN.
			Required if LUN is not marked as removable.
	ro		- Flag specifying access to the LUN shall be
			read-only. This is implied if CD-ROM emulation
			is enabled as well as when it was impossible
			to open "filename" in R/W mode.
	removable	- Flag specifying that LUN shall be indicated as
			being removable.
	cdrom		- Flag specifying that LUN shall be reported as
			being a CD-ROM.
	nofua		- Flag specifying that FUA flag
			in SCSI WRITE(10,12)

Testing the MASS STORAGE function
---------------------------------

device: connect the gadget, enable it

1) Playing a mid from the gadget to the host
host)

$ arecordmidi -l
 Port    Client name                      Port name
 14:0    Midi Through                     Midi Through Port-0
 24:0    MIDI Gadget                      MIDI Gadget MIDI 1
$ arecordmidi -p 24:0 from_gadget.mid

gadget)

$ aplaymidi -l
 Port    Client name                      Port name
 20:0    f_midi                           f_midi

$ aplaymidi -p 20:0 to_host.mid

2) Playing a mid from the host to the gadget
gadget)

$ arecordmidi -l
 Port    Client name                      Port name
 20:0    f_midi                           f_midi

$ arecordmidi -p 20:0 from_host.mid

host)

$ aplaymidi -l
 Port    Client name                      Port name
 14:0    Midi Through                     Midi Through Port-0
 24:0    MIDI Gadget                      MIDI Gadget MIDI 1

$ aplaymidi -p24:0 to_gadget.mid

The from_gadget.mid should sound identical to the to_host.mid.
The from_host.id should sound identical to the to_gadget.mid.

MIDI files can be played to speakers/headphones with e.g. timidity installed

$ aplaymidi -l
 Port    Client name                      Port name
 14:0    Midi Through                     Midi Through Port-0
 24:0    MIDI Gadget                      MIDI Gadget MIDI 1
128:0    TiMidity                         TiMidity port 0
128:1    TiMidity                         TiMidity port 1
128:2    TiMidity                         TiMidity port 2
128:3    TiMidity                         TiMidity port 3

$ aplaymidi -p 128:0 file.mid

MIDI ports can be logically connected using the aconnect utility, e.g.:

$ aconnect 24:0 128:0 # try it on the host

After the gadget's MIDI port is connected to timidity's MIDI port,
whatever is played at the gadget side with aplaymidi -l is audible
in host's speakers/headphones.

of hardware, so only SOCK_DGRAM has been tested. For the latter to work,
in the past I had to apply the patch mentioned here:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-usb/msg85689.html

These tools are required:

git://git.gitorious.org/meego-cellular/phonet-utils.git

On the host:

$ ./phonet -a 0x10 -i usbpn0

$./pnroute add 0x10 usbpn0
$ ifconfig usbpn0 up

On the device:

$ ./phonet -a 0x6c -i upnlink0
$ ./pnroute add 0x10 upnlink0
$ ifconfig upnlink0 up

Then a test program can be used:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-usb/msg85690.html

On the device:

$ ./pnxmit -a 0x6c -r

On the host:

$ ./pnxmit -a 0x10 -s 0x6c

As a result some data should be sent from host to device.

This function does not require real hardware support, it just
sends a stream of audio data to/from the host. In order to
actually hear something at the device side, a command similar
to this must be used at the device side:

$ arecord -f dat -t wav -D hw:2,0 | aplay -D hw:0,0 &
