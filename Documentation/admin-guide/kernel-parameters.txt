	acpi=		[HW,ACPI,X86,ARM64]
			Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
			Format: { force | on | off | strict | noirq | rsdt |
				  copy_dsdt }
			force -- enable ACPI if default was off
			on -- enable ACPI but allow fallback to DT [arm64]
			off -- disable ACPI if default was on
			noirq -- do not use ACPI for IRQ routing
			strict -- Be less tolerant of platforms that are not
				strictly ACPI specification compliant.
			rsdt -- prefer RSDT over (default) XSDT
			copy_dsdt -- copy DSDT to memory
			For ARM64, ONLY "acpi=off", "acpi=on" or "acpi=force"
			are available

			See also Documentation/power/runtime_pm.txt, pci=noacpi

	acpi_apic_instance=	[ACPI, IOAPIC]
			Format: <int>
			2: use 2nd APIC table, if available
			1,0: use 1st APIC table
			default: 0

	acpi_backlight=	[HW,ACPI]
			acpi_backlight=vendor
			acpi_backlight=video
			If set to vendor, prefer vendor specific driver
			(e.g. thinkpad_acpi, sony_acpi, etc.) instead
			of the ACPI video.ko driver.

	acpi_force_32bit_fadt_addr
			force FADT to use 32 bit addresses rather than the
			64 bit X_* addresses. Some firmware have broken 64
			bit addresses for force ACPI ignore these and use
			the older legacy 32 bit addresses.

	acpica_no_return_repair [HW, ACPI]
			Disable AML predefined validation mechanism
			This mechanism can repair the evaluation result to make
			the return objects more ACPI specification compliant.
			This option is useful for developers to identify the
			root cause of an AML interpreter issue when the issue
			has something to do with the repair mechanism.

	acpi.debug_layer=	[HW,ACPI,ACPI_DEBUG]
	acpi.debug_level=	[HW,ACPI,ACPI_DEBUG]
			Format: <int>
			CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG must be enabled to produce any ACPI
			debug output.  Bits in debug_layer correspond to a
			_COMPONENT in an ACPI source file, e.g.,
			    #define _COMPONENT ACPI_PCI_COMPONENT
			Bits in debug_level correspond to a level in
			ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT statements, e.g.,
			    ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT((ACPI_DB_INFO, ...
			The debug_level mask defaults to "info".  See
			Documentation/acpi/debug.txt for more information about
			debug layers and levels.

			Enable processor driver info messages:
			    acpi.debug_layer=0x20000000
			Enable PCI/PCI interrupt routing info messages:
			    acpi.debug_layer=0x400000
			Enable AML "Debug" output, i.e., stores to the Debug
			object while interpreting AML:
			    acpi.debug_layer=0xffffffff acpi.debug_level=0x2
			Enable all messages related to ACPI hardware:
			    acpi.debug_layer=0x2 acpi.debug_level=0xffffffff

			Some values produce so much output that the system is
			unusable.  The "log_buf_len" parameter may be useful
			if you need to capture more output.

	acpi_enforce_resources=	[ACPI]
			{ strict | lax | no }
			Check for resource conflicts between native drivers
			and ACPI OperationRegions (SystemIO and SystemMemory
			only). IO ports and memory declared in ACPI might be
			used by the ACPI subsystem in arbitrary AML code and
			can interfere with legacy drivers.
			strict (default): access to resources claimed by ACPI
			is denied; legacy drivers trying to access reserved
			resources will fail to bind to device using them.
			lax: access to resources claimed by ACPI is allowed;
			legacy drivers trying to access reserved resources
			will bind successfully but a warning message is logged.
			no: ACPI OperationRegions are not marked as reserved,
			no further checks are performed.

	acpi_force_table_verification	[HW,ACPI]
			Enable table checksum verification during early stage.
			By default, this is disabled due to x86 early mapping
			size limitation.

	acpi_irq_balance [HW,ACPI]
			ACPI will balance active IRQs
			default in APIC mode

	acpi_irq_nobalance [HW,ACPI]
			ACPI will not move active IRQs (default)
			default in PIC mode

	acpi_irq_isa=	[HW,ACPI] If irq_balance, mark listed IRQs used by ISA
			Format: <irq>,<irq>...

	acpi_irq_pci=	[HW,ACPI] If irq_balance, clear listed IRQs for
			use by PCI
			Format: <irq>,<irq>...

	acpi_mask_gpe=	[HW,ACPI]
			Due to the existence of _Lxx/_Exx, some GPEs triggered
			by unsupported hardware/firmware features can result in
			GPE floodings that cannot be automatically disabled by
			the GPE dispatcher.
			This facility can be used to prevent such uncontrolled
			GPE floodings.
			Format: <int>

	acpi_no_auto_serialize	[HW,ACPI]
			Disable auto-serialization of AML methods
			AML control methods that contain the opcodes to create
			named objects will be marked as "Serialized" by the
			auto-serialization feature.
			This feature is enabled by default.
			This option allows to turn off the feature.

	acpi_no_memhotplug [ACPI] Disable memory hotplug.  Useful for kdump
			   kernels.

	acpi_no_static_ssdt	[HW,ACPI]
			Disable installation of static SSDTs at early boot time
			By default, SSDTs contained in the RSDT/XSDT will be
			installed automatically and they will appear under
			/sys/firmware/acpi/tables.
			This option turns off this feature.
			Note that specifying this option does not affect
			dynamic table installation which will install SSDT
			tables to /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/dynamic.

	acpi_rsdp=	[ACPI,EFI,KEXEC]
			Pass the RSDP address to the kernel, mostly used
			on machines running EFI runtime service to boot the
			second kernel for kdump.

	acpi_os_name=	[HW,ACPI] Tell ACPI BIOS the name of the OS
			Format: To spoof as Windows 98: ="Microsoft Windows"

	acpi_rev_override [ACPI] Override the _REV object to return 5 (instead
			of 2 which is mandated by ACPI 6) as the supported ACPI
			specification revision (when using this switch, it may
			be necessary to carry out a cold reboot _twice_ in a
			row to make it take effect on the platform firmware).

	acpi_osi=	[HW,ACPI] Modify list of supported OS interface strings
			acpi_osi="string1"	# add string1
			acpi_osi="!string2"	# remove string2
			acpi_osi=!*		# remove all strings
			acpi_osi=!		# disable all built-in OS vendor
						  strings
			acpi_osi=!!		# enable all built-in OS vendor
						  strings
			acpi_osi=		# disable all strings

			'acpi_osi=!' can be used in combination with single or
			multiple 'acpi_osi="string1"' to support specific OS
			vendor string(s).  Note that such command can only
			affect the default state of the OS vendor strings, thus
			it cannot affect the default state of the feature group
			strings and the current state of the OS vendor strings,
			specifying it multiple times through kernel command line
			is meaningless.  This command is useful when one do not
			care about the state of the feature group strings which
			should be controlled by the OSPM.
			Examples:
			  1. 'acpi_osi=! acpi_osi="Windows 2000"' is equivalent
			     to 'acpi_osi="Windows 2000" acpi_osi=!', they all
			     can make '_OSI("Windows 2000")' TRUE.

			'acpi_osi=' cannot be used in combination with other
			'acpi_osi=' command lines, the _OSI method will not
			exist in the ACPI namespace.  NOTE that such command can
			only affect the _OSI support state, thus specifying it
			multiple times through kernel command line is also
			meaningless.
			Examples:
			  1. 'acpi_osi=' can make 'CondRefOf(_OSI, Local1)'
			     FALSE.

			'acpi_osi=!*' can be used in combination with single or
			multiple 'acpi_osi="string1"' to support specific
			string(s).  Note that such command can affect the
			current state of both the OS vendor strings and the
			feature group strings, thus specifying it multiple times
			through kernel command line is meaningful.  But it may
			still not able to affect the final state of a string if
			there are quirks related to this string.  This command
			is useful when one want to control the state of the
			feature group strings to debug BIOS issues related to
			the OSPM features.
			Examples:
			  1. 'acpi_osi="Module Device" acpi_osi=!*' can make
			     '_OSI("Module Device")' FALSE.
			  2. 'acpi_osi=!* acpi_osi="Module Device"' can make
			     '_OSI("Module Device")' TRUE.
			  3. 'acpi_osi=! acpi_osi=!* acpi_osi="Windows 2000"' is
			     equivalent to
			     'acpi_osi=!* acpi_osi=! acpi_osi="Windows 2000"'
			     and
			     'acpi_osi=!* acpi_osi="Windows 2000" acpi_osi=!',
			     they all will make '_OSI("Windows 2000")' TRUE.

	acpi_pm_good	[X86]
			Override the pmtimer bug detection: force the kernel
			to assume that this machine's pmtimer latches its value
			and always returns good values.

	acpi_sci=	[HW,ACPI] ACPI System Control Interrupt trigger mode
			Format: { level | edge | high | low }

	acpi_skip_timer_override [HW,ACPI]
			Recognize and ignore IRQ0/pin2 Interrupt Override.
			For broken nForce2 BIOS resulting in XT-PIC timer.

	acpi_sleep=	[HW,ACPI] Sleep options
			Format: { s3_bios, s3_mode, s3_beep, s4_nohwsig,
				  old_ordering, nonvs, sci_force_enable, nobl }
			See Documentation/power/video.txt for information on
			s3_bios and s3_mode.
			s3_beep is for debugging; it makes the PC's speaker beep
			as soon as the kernel's real-mode entry point is called.
			s4_nohwsig prevents ACPI hardware signature from being
			used during resume from hibernation.
			old_ordering causes the ACPI 1.0 ordering of the _PTS
			control method, with respect to putting devices into
			low power states, to be enforced (the ACPI 2.0 ordering
			of _PTS is used by default).
			nonvs prevents the kernel from saving/restoring the
			ACPI NVS memory during suspend/hibernation and resume.
			sci_force_enable causes the kernel to set SCI_EN directly
			on resume from S1/S3 (which is against the ACPI spec,
			but some broken systems don't work without it).
			nobl causes the internal blacklist of systems known to
			behave incorrectly in some ways with respect to system
			suspend and resume to be ignored (use wisely).

	acpi_use_timer_override [HW,ACPI]
			Use timer override. For some broken Nvidia NF5 boards
			that require a timer override, but don't have HPET

	add_efi_memmap	[EFI; X86] Include EFI memory map in
			kernel's map of available physical RAM.

	agp=		[AGP]

	ALSA		[HW,ALSA]
			See Documentation/sound/alsa-configuration.rst

	alignment=	[KNL,ARM]

			behaviour to be specified.  Bit 0 enables warnings,
			bit 1 enables fixups, and bit 2 sends a segfault.

	align_va_addr=	[X86-64]
			Align virtual addresses by clearing slice [14:12] when
			allocating a VMA at process creation time. This option
			gives you up to 3% performance improvement on AMD F15h
			machines (where it is enabled by default) for a
			CPU-intensive style benchmark, and it can vary highly in
			a microbenchmark depending on workload and compiler.

			32: only for 32-bit processes
			64: only for 64-bit processes
			on: enable for both 32- and 64-bit processes
			off: disable for both 32- and 64-bit processes

	alloc_snapshot	[FTRACE]
			Allocate the ftrace snapshot buffer on boot up when the
			main buffer is allocated. This is handy if debugging
			and you need to use tracing_snapshot() on boot up, and
			do not want to use tracing_snapshot_alloc() as it needs
			to be done where GFP_KERNEL allocations are allowed.

	amd_iommu=	[HW,X86-64]
			Pass parameters to the AMD IOMMU driver in the system.
			Possible values are:
			fullflush - enable flushing of IO/TLB entries when
				    they are unmapped. Otherwise they are
				    flushed before they will be reused, which
				    is a lot of faster
			off	  - do not initialize any AMD IOMMU found in
				    the system
			force_isolation - Force device isolation for all
					  devices. The IOMMU driver is not
					  allowed anymore to lift isolation
					  requirements as needed. This option
					  does not override iommu=pt

	amd_iommu_dump=	[HW,X86-64]
			Enable AMD IOMMU driver option to dump the ACPI table
			for AMD IOMMU. With this option enabled, AMD IOMMU
			driver will print ACPI tables for AMD IOMMU during
			IOMMU initialization.

	amd_iommu_intr=	[HW,X86-64]
			Specifies one of the following AMD IOMMU interrupt
			remapping modes:
			legacy     - Use legacy interrupt remapping mode.
			vapic      - Use virtual APIC mode, which allows IOMMU
			             to inject interrupts directly into guest.
			             This mode requires kvm-amd.avic=1.
			             (Default when IOMMU HW support is present.)

	amijoy.map=	[HW,JOY] Amiga joystick support
			Map of devices attached to JOY0DAT and JOY1DAT
			Format: <a>,<b>
			See also Documentation/input/joydev/joystick.rst

	analog.map=	[HW,JOY] Analog joystick and gamepad support
			Specifies type or capabilities of an analog joystick
			connected to one of 16 gameports
			Format: <type1>,<type2>,..<type16>

	apc=		[HW,SPARC]
			Power management functions (SPARCstation-4/5 + deriv.)
			Format: noidle
			Disable APC CPU standby support. SPARCstation-Fox does
			not play well with APC CPU idle - disable it if you have
			APC and your system crashes randomly.

	apic=		[APIC,X86] Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller
			Change the output verbosity while booting
			Format: { quiet (default) | verbose | debug }
			Change the amount of debugging information output
			when initialising the APIC and IO-APIC components.
			For X86-32, this can also be used to specify an APIC
			driver name.
			Format: apic=driver_name
			Examples: apic=bigsmp

	apic_extnmi=	[APIC,X86] External NMI delivery setting
			Format: { bsp (default) | all | none }
			bsp:  External NMI is delivered only to CPU 0
			all:  External NMIs are broadcast to all CPUs as a
			      backup of CPU 0
			none: External NMI is masked for all CPUs. This is
			      useful so that a dump capture kernel won't be
			      shot down by NMI

	autoconf=	[IPV6]
			See Documentation/networking/ipv6.txt.

	show_lapic=	[APIC,X86] Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller
			Limit apic dumping. The parameter defines the maximal
			number of local apics being dumped. Also it is possible
			to set it to "all" by meaning -- no limit here.
			Format: { 1 (default) | 2 | ... | all }.
			The parameter valid if only apic=debug or
			apic=verbose is specified.
			Example: apic=debug show_lapic=all

	apm=		[APM] Advanced Power Management
			See header of arch/x86/kernel/apm_32.c.

			Use software keyboard repeat

	audit=		[KNL] Enable the audit sub-system
			Format: { "0" | "1" | "off" | "on" }
			0 | off - kernel audit is disabled and can not be
			    enabled until the next reboot
			unset - kernel audit is initialized but disabled and
			    will be fully enabled by the userspace auditd.
			1 | on - kernel audit is initialized and partially
			    enabled, storing at most audit_backlog_limit
			    messages in RAM until it is fully enabled by the
			    userspace auditd.
			Default: unset

	audit_backlog_limit= [KNL] Set the audit queue size limit.
			Format: <int> (must be >=0)
			Default: 64

	bau=		[X86_UV] Enable the BAU on SGI UV.  The default
			behavior is to disable the BAU (i.e. bau=0).
			Format: { "0" | "1" }
			0 - Disable the BAU.
			1 - Enable the BAU.
			unset - Disable the BAU.

	baycom_epp=	[HW,AX25]
			Format: <io>,<mode>

	baycom_par=	[HW,AX25] BayCom Parallel Port AX.25 Modem
			Format: <io>,<mode>

			BayCom Serial Port AX.25 Modem (Half Duplex Mode)
			Format: <io>,<irq>,<mode>
			See header of drivers/net/hamradio/baycom_ser_hdx.c.

	blkdevparts=	Manual partition parsing of block device(s) for
			embedded devices based on command line input.
			See Documentation/block/cmdline-partition.txt

	boot_delay=	Milliseconds to delay each printk during boot.
			Values larger than 10 seconds (10000) are changed to
			no delay (0).
			Format: integer

	bootmem_debug	[KNL] Enable bootmem allocator debug messages.

	bert_disable	[ACPI]
			Disable BERT OS support on buggy BIOSes.

	bttv.card=	[HW,V4L] bttv (bt848 + bt878 based grabber cards)
	bttv.radio=	Most important insmod options are available as
			kernel args too.
	bttv.pll=	See Documentation/media/v4l-drivers/bttv.rst
	bttv.tuner=

	bulk_remove=off	[PPC]  This parameter disables the use of the pSeries
			firmware feature for flushing multiple hpte entries
			at a time.

	c101=		[NET] Moxa C101 synchronous serial card

	cachesize=	[BUGS=X86-32] Override level 2 CPU cache size detection.
			Sometimes CPU hardware bugs make them report the cache
			size incorrectly. The kernel will attempt work arounds
			to fix known problems, but for some CPUs it is not
			possible to determine what the correct size should be.
			This option provides an override for these situations.

	carrier_timeout=
			[NET] Specifies amount of time (in seconds) that
			the kernel should wait for a network carrier. By default
			it waits 120 seconds.

	ca_keys=	[KEYS] This parameter identifies a specific key(s) on
			the system trusted keyring to be used for certificate
			trust validation.
			format: { id:<keyid> | builtin }

	cca=		[MIPS] Override the kernel pages' cache coherency
			algorithm.  Accepted values range from 0 to 7
			inclusive. See arch/mips/include/asm/pgtable-bits.h
			for platform specific values (SB1, Loongson3 and
			others).

	ccw_timeout_log	[S390]
			See Documentation/s390/common_io.rst for details.

	cgroup_disable=	[KNL] Disable a particular controller
			Format: {name of the controller(s) to disable}
			The effects of cgroup_disable=foo are:
			- foo isn't auto-mounted if you mount all cgroups in
			  a single hierarchy
			- foo isn't visible as an individually mountable
			  subsystem
			{Currently only "memory" controller deal with this and
			cut the overhead, others just disable the usage. So
			only cgroup_disable=memory is actually worthy}

	cgroup_no_v1=	[KNL] Disable cgroup controllers and named hierarchies in v1
			Format: { { controller | "all" | "named" }
			          [,{ controller | "all" | "named" }...] }
			Like cgroup_disable, but only applies to cgroup v1;
			the blacklisted controllers remain available in cgroup2.
			"all" blacklists all controllers and "named" disables
			named mounts. Specifying both "all" and "named" disables
			all v1 hierarchies.

	cgroup.memory=	[KNL] Pass options to the cgroup memory controller.
			Format: <string>
			nosocket -- Disable socket memory accounting.
			nokmem -- Disable kernel memory accounting.

	checkreqprot	[SELINUX] Set initial checkreqprot flag value.
			Format: { "0" | "1" }
			See security/selinux/Kconfig help text.
			0 -- check protection applied by kernel (includes
				any implied execute protection).
			1 -- check protection requested by application.
			Default value is set via a kernel config option.
			Value can be changed at runtime via
				/selinux/checkreqprot.

	cio_ignore=	[S390]
			See Documentation/s390/common_io.rst for details.
	clk_ignore_unused
			[CLK]
			Prevents the clock framework from automatically gating
			clocks that have not been explicitly enabled by a Linux
			device driver but are enabled in hardware at reset or
			by the bootloader/firmware. Note that this does not
			force such clocks to be always-on nor does it reserve
			those clocks in any way. This parameter is useful for
			debug and development, but should not be needed on a
			platform with proper driver support.  For more
			information, see Documentation/driver-api/clk.rst.

	clock=		[BUGS=X86-32, HW] gettimeofday clocksource override.
			[Deprecated]
			Forces specified clocksource (if available) to be used
			when calculating gettimeofday(). If specified
			clocksource is not available, it defaults to PIT.
			Format: { pit | tsc | cyclone | pmtmr }

	clocksource=	Override the default clocksource
			Format: <string>
			Override the default clocksource and use the clocksource
			with the name specified.
			Some clocksource names to choose from, depending on
			the platform:
			[all] jiffies (this is the base, fallback clocksource)
			[ACPI] acpi_pm
			[ARM] imx_timer1,OSTS,netx_timer,mpu_timer2,

			[SH] SuperH
			[SPARC64] tick
			[X86-64] hpet,tsc

	clocksource.arm_arch_timer.evtstrm=
			[ARM,ARM64]
			Format: <bool>
			Enable/disable the eventstream feature of the ARM
			architected timer so that code using WFE-based polling
			loops can be debugged more effectively on production
			systems.

	clearcpuid=BITNUM [X86]
			Disable CPUID feature X for the kernel. See
			arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h for the valid bit
			numbers. Note the Linux specific bits are not necessarily
			stable over kernel options, but the vendor specific
			ones should be.
			Also note that user programs calling CPUID directly
			or using the feature without checking anything
			will still see it. This just prevents it from
			being used by the kernel or shown in /proc/cpuinfo.
			Also note the kernel might malfunction if you disable
			some critical bits.

	cma=nn[MG]@[start[MG][-end[MG]]]
			[ARM,X86,KNL]
			Sets the size of kernel global memory area for
			contiguous memory allocations and optionally the
			placement constraint by the physical address range of
			memory allocations. A value of 0 disables CMA
			altogether. For more information, see
			include/linux/dma-contiguous.h

	cmo_free_hint=	[PPC] Format: { yes | no }
			Specify whether pages are marked as being inactive
			when they are freed.  This is used in CMO environments
			to determine OS memory pressure for page stealing by
			a hypervisor.
			Default: yes

	coherent_pool=nn[KMG]	[ARM,KNL]
			Sets the size of memory pool for coherent, atomic dma
			allocations, by default set to 256K.

	com20020=	[HW,NET] ARCnet - COM20020 chipset
			Format:
			<io>[,<irq>[,<nodeID>[,<backplane>[,<ckp>[,<timeout>]]]]]

	com90io=	[HW,NET] ARCnet - COM90xx chipset (IO-mapped buffers)
			Format: <io>[,<irq>]

	com90xx=	[HW,NET]
			ARCnet - COM90xx chipset (memory-mapped buffers)
			Format: <io>[,<irq>[,<memstart>]]

	condev=		[HW,S390] console device
	conmode=

	console=	[KNL] Output console device and options.

		tty<n>	Use the virtual console device <n>.

		ttyS<n>[,options]
		ttyUSB0[,options]
			Use the specified serial port.  The options are of
			the form "bbbbpnf", where "bbbb" is the baud rate,
			"p" is parity ("n", "o", or "e"), "n" is number of
			bits, and "f" is flow control ("r" for RTS or
			omit it).  Default is "9600n8".

			See Documentation/admin-guide/serial-console.rst for more
			information.  See
			Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt for an
			alternative.

		uart[8250],io,<addr>[,options]
		uart[8250],mmio,<addr>[,options]
		uart[8250],mmio16,<addr>[,options]
		uart[8250],mmio32,<addr>[,options]
		uart[8250],0x<addr>[,options]
			Start an early, polled-mode console on the 8250/16550
			UART at the specified I/O port or MMIO address,
			switching to the matching ttyS device later.
			MMIO inter-register address stride is either 8-bit
			(mmio), 16-bit (mmio16), or 32-bit (mmio32).
			If none of [io|mmio|mmio16|mmio32], <addr> is assumed
			to be equivalent to 'mmio'. 'options' are specified in
			the same format described for ttyS above; if unspecified,
			the h/w is not re-initialized.

		hvc<n>	Use the hypervisor console device <n>. This is for
			both Xen and PowerPC hypervisors.

		If the device connected to the port is not a TTY but a braille
		device, prepend "brl," before the device type, for instance
			console=brl,ttyS0
		For now, only VisioBraille is supported.

	console_msg_format=
			[KNL] Change console messages format
		default
			By default we print messages on consoles in
			"[time stamp] text\n" format (time stamp may not be
			printed, depending on CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME or
			`printk_time' param).
		syslog
			Switch to syslog format: "<%u>[time stamp] text\n"
			IOW, each message will have a facility and loglevel
			prefix. The format is similar to one used by syslog()
			syscall, or to executing "dmesg -S --raw" or to reading
			from /proc/kmsg.

	consoleblank=	[KNL] The console blank (screen saver) timeout in
			seconds. A value of 0 disables the blank timer.
			Defaults to 0.

	coredump_filter=
			[KNL] Change the default value for
			/proc/<pid>/coredump_filter.
			See also Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt.

	coresight_cpu_debug.enable
			[ARM,ARM64]
			Format: <bool>
			Enable/disable the CPU sampling based debugging.
			0: default value, disable debugging
			1: enable debugging at boot time

	cpuidle.off=1	[CPU_IDLE]
			disable the cpuidle sub-system

	cpuidle.governor=
			[CPU_IDLE] Name of the cpuidle governor to use.

	cpufreq.off=1	[CPU_FREQ]
			disable the cpufreq sub-system

	cpu_init_udelay=N
			[X86] Delay for N microsec between assert and de-assert
			of APIC INIT to start processors.  This delay occurs
			on every CPU online, such as boot, and resume from suspend.
			Default: 10000

	cpcihp_generic=	[HW,PCI] Generic port I/O CompactPCI driver
			Format:
			<first_slot>,<last_slot>,<port>,<enum_bit>[,<debug>]

	crashkernel=size[KMG][@offset[KMG]]
			[KNL] Using kexec, Linux can switch to a 'crash kernel'
			upon panic. This parameter reserves the physical
			memory region [offset, offset + size] for that kernel
			image. If '@offset' is omitted, then a suitable offset
			is selected automatically.
			[KNL, x86_64] select a region under 4G first, and
			fall back to reserve region above 4G when '@offset'
			hasn't been specified.
			See Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt for further details.

	crashkernel=range1:size1[,range2:size2,...][@offset]
			[KNL] Same as above, but depends on the memory
			in the running system. The syntax of range is
			start-[end] where start and end are both
			a memory unit (amount[KMG]). See also
			Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt for an example.

	crashkernel=size[KMG],high
			[KNL, x86_64] range could be above 4G. Allow kernel
			to allocate physical memory region from top, so could
			be above 4G if system have more than 4G ram installed.
			Otherwise memory region will be allocated below 4G, if
			available.
			It will be ignored if crashkernel=X is specified.
	crashkernel=size[KMG],low
			[KNL, x86_64] range under 4G. When crashkernel=X,high
			is passed, kernel could allocate physical memory region
			above 4G, that cause second kernel crash on system
			that require some amount of low memory, e.g. swiotlb
			requires at least 64M+32K low memory, also enough extra
			low memory is needed to make sure DMA buffers for 32-bit
			devices won't run out. Kernel would try to allocate at
			at least 256M below 4G automatically.
			This one let user to specify own low range under 4G
			for second kernel instead.
			0: to disable low allocation.
			It will be ignored when crashkernel=X,high is not used
			or memory reserved is below 4G.

	ddebug_query=	[KNL,DYNAMIC_DEBUG] Enable debug messages at early boot
			time. See
			Documentation/admin-guide/dynamic-debug-howto.rst for
			details.  Deprecated, see dyndbg.

	debug		[KNL] Enable kernel debugging (events log level).

	debug_boot_weak_hash
			[KNL] Enable printing [hashed] pointers early in the
			boot sequence.  If enabled, we use a weak hash instead
			of siphash to hash pointers.  Use this option if you are
			seeing instances of '(___ptrval___)') and need to see a
			value (hashed pointer) instead. Cryptographically
			insecure, please do not use on production kernels.

	debug_locks_verbose=
			[KNL] verbose self-tests
			Format=<0|1>
			Print debugging info while doing the locking API
			self-tests.
			We default to 0 (no extra messages), setting it to
			1 will print _a lot_ more information - normally
			only useful to kernel developers.

	debug_objects	[KNL] Enable object debugging

	no_debug_objects
			[KNL] Disable object debugging

	debug_guardpage_minorder=
			[KNL] When CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is set, this
			parameter allows control of the order of pages that will
			be intentionally kept free (and hence protected) by the
			buddy allocator. Bigger value increase the probability
			of catching random memory corruption, but reduce the
			amount of memory for normal system use. The maximum
			possible value is MAX_ORDER/2.  Setting this parameter
			to 1 or 2 should be enough to identify most random
			memory corruption problems caused by bugs in kernel or
			driver code when a CPU writes to (or reads from) a
			random memory location. Note that there exists a class
			of memory corruptions problems caused by buggy H/W or
			F/W or by drivers badly programing DMA (basically when
			memory is written at bus level and the CPU MMU is
			bypassed) which are not detectable by
			CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, hence this option will not help
			tracking down these problems.

	debug_pagealloc=
			[KNL] When CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is set, this
			parameter enables the feature at boot time. In
			default, it is disabled. We can avoid allocating huge
			chunk of memory for debug pagealloc if we don't enable
			it at boot time and the system will work mostly same
			with the kernel built without CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC.
			on: enable the feature

	debugpat	[X86] Enable PAT debugging

	default_hugepagesz=
			[same as hugepagesz=] The size of the default
			HugeTLB page size. This is the size represented by
			the legacy /proc/ hugepages APIs, used for SHM, and
			default size when mounting hugetlbfs filesystems.
			Defaults to the default architecture's huge page size
			if not specified.

	deferred_probe_timeout=
			[KNL] Debugging option to set a timeout in seconds for
			deferred probe to give up waiting on dependencies to
			probe. Only specific dependencies (subsystems or
			drivers) that have opted in will be ignored. A timeout of 0
			will timeout at the end of initcalls. This option will also
			dump out devices still on the deferred probe list after
			retrying.

	dhash_entries=	[KNL]
			Set number of hash buckets for dentry cache.

	disable_1tb_segments [PPC]
			Disables the use of 1TB hash page table segments. This
			causes the kernel to fall back to 256MB segments which
			can be useful when debugging issues that require an SLB
			miss to occur.

	disable=	[IPV6]
			See Documentation/networking/ipv6.txt.

	hardened_usercopy=
                        [KNL] Under CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY, whether
                        hardening is enabled for this boot. Hardened
                        usercopy checking is used to protect the kernel
                        from reading or writing beyond known memory
                        allocation boundaries as a proactive defense
                        against bounds-checking flaws in the kernel's
                        copy_to_user()/copy_from_user() interface.
                on      Perform hardened usercopy checks (default).

			INIT from AP to BSP.

	perf_v4_pmi=	[X86,INTEL]
			Format: <bool>
			Disable Intel PMU counter freezing feature.
			The feature only exists starting from
			Arch Perfmon v4 (Skylake and newer).

	disable_ddw	[PPC/PSERIES]
			Disable Dynamic DMA Window support. Use this if
			to workaround buggy firmware.

	disable_ipv6=	[IPV6]
			See Documentation/networking/ipv6.txt.

	disable_mtrr_cleanup [X86]
			The kernel tries to adjust MTRR layout from continuous
			to discrete, to make X server driver able to add WB
			entry later. This parameter disables that.

	disable_mtrr_trim [X86, Intel and AMD only]
			By default the kernel will trim any uncacheable
			memory out of your available memory pool based on
			MTRR settings.  This parameter disables that behavior,
			possibly causing your machine to run very slowly.

	disable_timer_pin_1 [X86]
			Disable PIN 1 of APIC timer
			Can be useful to work around chipset bugs.

	dis_ucode_ldr	[X86] Disable the microcode loader.

	dma_debug=off	If the kernel is compiled with DMA_API_DEBUG support,
			this option disables the debugging code at boot.

	dma_debug_entries=<number>
			This option allows to tune the number of preallocated
			entries for DMA-API debugging code. One entry is
			required per DMA-API allocation. Use this if the
			DMA-API debugging code disables itself because the
			architectural default is too low.

	dma_debug_driver=<driver_name>
			With this option the DMA-API debugging driver
			filter feature can be enabled at boot time. Just
			pass the driver to filter for as the parameter.
			The filter can be disabled or changed to another
			driver later using sysfs.

	driver_async_probe=  [KNL]
			List of driver names to be probed asynchronously.
			Format: <driver_name1>,<driver_name2>...

	drm.edid_firmware=[<connector>:]<file>[,[<connector>:]<file>]
			Broken monitors, graphic adapters, KVMs and EDIDless
			panels may send no or incorrect EDID data sets.
			This parameter allows to specify an EDID data sets
			in the /lib/firmware directory that are used instead.
			Generic built-in EDID data sets are used, if one of
			edid/1024x768.bin, edid/1280x1024.bin,
			edid/1680x1050.bin, or edid/1920x1080.bin is given
			and no file with the same name exists. Details and
			instructions how to build your own EDID data are
			available in Documentation/EDID/HOWTO.txt. An EDID
			data set will only be used for a particular connector,
			if its name and a colon are prepended to the EDID
			name. Each connector may use a unique EDID data
			set by separating the files with a comma.  An EDID
			data set with no connector name will be used for
			any connectors not explicitly specified.

	dscc4.setup=	[NET]

	dt_cpu_ftrs=	[PPC]
			Format: {"off" | "known"}
			Control how the dt_cpu_ftrs device-tree binding is
			used for CPU feature discovery and setup (if it
			exists).

			If none of [io|mmio|mmio32|mmio32be], <addr> is assumed
			to be equivalent to 'mmio'. 'options' are specified
			in the same format described for "console=ttyS<n>"; if
			unspecified, the h/w is not initialized.

		pl011,<addr>
		pl011,mmio32,<addr>
			Start an early, polled-mode console on a pl011 serial
			port at the specified address. The pl011 serial port

			earlyprintk=ttySn[,baudrate]
			earlyprintk=dbgp[debugController#]
			earlyprintk=pciserial[,force],bus:device.function[,baudrate]
			earlyprintk=xdbc[xhciController#]

			earlyprintk is useful when the kernel crashes before
			the normal console is initialized. It is not enabled by
			default because it has some cosmetic problems.

			Append ",keep" to not disable it when the real console
			takes over.

			Only one of vga, efi, serial, or usb debug port can
			be used at a time.

			Currently only ttyS0 and ttyS1 may be specified by
			name.  Other I/O ports may be explicitly specified
			on some architectures (x86 and arm at least) by
			replacing ttySn with an I/O port address, like this:
				earlyprintk=serial,0x1008,115200
			You can find the port for a given device in
			/proc/tty/driver/serial:
				2: uart:ST16650V2 port:00001008 irq:18 ...

			Interaction with the standard serial driver is not
			very good.

			The VGA and EFI output is eventually overwritten by
			the real console.

			The xen output can only be used by Xen PV guests.

			The sclp output can only be used on s390.

			The optional "force" to "pciserial" enables use of a
			PCI device even when its classcode is not of the
			UART class.

	efi_fake_mem=	nn[KMG]@ss[KMG]:aa[,nn[KMG]@ss[KMG]:aa,..] [EFI; X86]
			Add arbitrary attribute to specific memory range by
			updating original EFI memory map.

			from ss to ss+nn.
			If efi_fake_mem=2G@4G:0x10000,2G@0x10a0000000:0x10000
			is specified, EFI_MEMORY_MORE_RELIABLE(0x10000)
			attribute is added to range 0x100000000-0x180000000 and
			0x10a0000000-0x1120000000.

			Using this parameter you can do debugging of EFI memmap

			capability is set.

	i915.invert_brightness=
			[DRM] Invert the sense of the variable that is used to
			set the brightness of the panel backlight. Normally a
			brightness value of 0 indicates backlight switched off,
			and the maximum of the brightness value sets the backlight
			to maximum brightness. If this parameter is set to 0
			(default) and the machine requires it, or this parameter
			is set to 1, a brightness value of 0 sets the backlight
			to maximum brightness, and the maximum of the brightness

	icn=		[HW,ISDN]
			Format: <io>[,<membase>[,<icn_id>[,<icn_id2>]]]

			.cdrom .chs .ignore_cable are additional options
			See Documentation/ide/ide.txt.

	ide-generic.probe-mask= [HW] (E)IDE subsystem
			Format: <int>
			Probe mask for legacy ISA IDE ports.  Depending on
			platform up to 6 ports are supported, enabled by
			setting corresponding bits in the mask to 1.  The
			default value is 0x0, which has a special meaning.
			On systems that have PCI, it triggers scanning the
			PCI bus for the first and the second port, which
			are then probed.  On systems without PCI the value
			of 0x0 enables probing the two first ports as if it
			was 0x3.

	ide-pci-generic.all-generic-ide [HW] (E)IDE subsystem
			Claim all unknown PCI IDE storage controllers.

	idle=		[X86]
			Format: idle=poll, idle=halt, idle=nomwait
			Poll forces a polling idle loop that can slightly
			improve the performance of waking up a idle CPU, but
			will use a lot of power and make the system run hot.
			Not recommended.
			idle=halt: Halt is forced to be used for CPU idle.
			In such case C2/C3 won't be used again.
			idle=nomwait: Disable mwait for CPU C-states

	ieee754=	[MIPS] Select IEEE Std 754 conformance mode
			Format: { strict | legacy | 2008 | relaxed }
			Default: strict

			Choose which programs will be accepted for execution
			based on the IEEE 754 NaN encoding(s) supported by
			the FPU and the NaN encoding requested with the value
			of an ELF file header flag individually set by each
			binary.  Hardware implementations are permitted to
			support either or both of the legacy and the 2008 NaN
			encoding mode.

			Available settings are as follows:
			strict	accept binaries that request a NaN encoding
				supported by the FPU
			legacy	only accept legacy-NaN binaries, if supported
				by the FPU
			2008	only accept 2008-NaN binaries, if supported
				by the FPU
			relaxed	accept any binaries regardless of whether
				supported by the FPU

			The FPU emulator is always able to support both NaN
			encodings, so if no FPU hardware is present or it has
			been disabled with 'nofpu', then the settings of
			'legacy' and '2008' strap the emulator accordingly,
			'relaxed' straps the emulator for both legacy-NaN and
			2008-NaN, whereas 'strict' enables legacy-NaN only on
			legacy processors and both NaN encodings on MIPS32 or
			MIPS64 CPUs.

			The setting for ABS.fmt/NEG.fmt instruction execution
			mode generally follows that for the NaN encoding,
			except where unsupported by hardware.

	ignore_loglevel	[KNL]
			Ignore loglevel setting - this will print /all/
			kernel messages to the console. Useful for debugging.
			We also add it as printk module parameter, so users
			could change it dynamically, usually by
			/sys/module/printk/parameters/ignore_loglevel.

	ignore_rlimit_data
			Ignore RLIMIT_DATA setting for data mappings,
			print warning at first misuse.  Can be changed via
			/sys/module/kernel/parameters/ignore_rlimit_data.

			in crypto/hash_info.h.

	ima_policy=	[IMA]
			The builtin policies to load during IMA setup.
			Format: "tcb | appraise_tcb | secure_boot |
				 fail_securely"

			The "tcb" policy measures all programs exec'd, files
			mmap'd for exec, and all files opened with the read
			mode bit set by either the effective uid (euid=0) or
			uid=0.

			The "appraise_tcb" policy appraises the integrity of
			all files owned by root.

			The "secure_boot" policy appraises the integrity
			of files (eg. kexec kernel image, kernel modules,
			firmware, policy, etc) based on file signatures.

			The "fail_securely" policy forces file signature
			verification failure also on privileged mounted
			filesystems with the SB_I_UNVERIFIABLE_SIGNATURE
			flag.

	ima_tcb		[IMA] Deprecated.  Use ima_policy= instead.
			Load a policy which meets the needs of the Trusted
			Computing Base.  This means IMA will measure all
			programs exec'd, files mmap'd for exec, and all files
			opened for read by uid=0.

	ima_template=	[IMA]
			Select one of defined IMA measurements template formats.
			Formats: { "ima" | "ima-ng" | "ima-sig" }
			Default: "ima-ng"

			to achieve the best performance for a particular HW.

	ima.ahash_bufsize= [IMA] Asynchronous hash buffer size
			Format: <bufsize>
			Set hashing buffer size. Default: 4k.

			ahash performance varies for different chunk sizes on
			different crypto accelerators. This option can be used
			to achieve best performance for particular HW.

	init=		[KNL]
			Format: <full_path>
			Run specified binary instead of /sbin/init as init
			process.

	initcall_debug	[KNL] Trace initcalls as they are executed.  Useful
			for working out where the kernel is dying during
			startup.

	integrity_audit=[IMA]
			Format: { "0" | "1" }
			0 -- basic integrity auditing messages. (Default)
			1 -- additional integrity auditing messages.

	intel_iommu=	[DMAR] Intel IOMMU driver (DMAR) option
		on
			Enable intel iommu driver.
		off
			Disable intel iommu driver.
		igfx_off [Default Off]
			By default, gfx is mapped as normal device. If a gfx
			device has a dedicated DMAR unit, the DMAR unit is
			bypassed by not enabling DMAR with this option. In
			this case, gfx device will use physical address for
			DMA.
		forcedac [x86_64]
			With this option iommu will not optimize to look
			for io virtual address below 32-bit forcing dual
			address cycle on pci bus for cards supporting greater
			than 32-bit addressing. The default is to look
			for translation below 32-bit and if not available
			then look in the higher range.
		strict [Default Off]
			With this option on every unmap_single operation will
			result in a hardware IOTLB flush operation as opposed
			to batching them for performance.
		sp_off [Default Off]
			By default, super page will be supported if Intel IOMMU
			has the capability. With this option, super page will
			not be supported.
		sm_on [Default Off]
			By default, scalable mode will be disabled even if the
			hardware advertises that it has support for the scalable
			mode translation. With this option set, scalable mode
			will be used on hardware which claims to support it.
		tboot_noforce [Default Off]
			Do not force the Intel IOMMU enabled under tboot.
			By default, tboot will force Intel IOMMU on, which
			could harm performance of some high-throughput
			devices like 40GBit network cards, even if identity
			mapping is enabled.
			Note that using this option lowers the security
			provided by tboot because it makes the system
			vulnerable to DMA attacks.

	intel_idle.max_cstate=	[KNL,HW,ACPI,X86]
			0	disables intel_idle and fall back on acpi_idle.
			1 to 9	specify maximum depth of C-state.

	intel_pstate=	[X86]
			disable
			  Do not enable intel_pstate as the default
			  scaling driver for the supported processors
			passive
			  Use intel_pstate as a scaling driver, but configure it
			  to work with generic cpufreq governors (instead of
			  enabling its internal governor).  This mode cannot be
			  used along with the hardware-managed P-states (HWP)
			  feature.
			force
			  Enable intel_pstate on systems that prohibit it by default
			  in favor of acpi-cpufreq. Forcing the intel_pstate driver
			  instead of acpi-cpufreq may disable platform features, such
			  as thermal controls and power capping, that rely on ACPI
			  P-States information being indicated to OSPM and therefore
			  should be used with caution. This option does not work with
			  processors that aren't supported by the intel_pstate driver
			  or on platforms that use pcc-cpufreq instead of acpi-cpufreq.
			no_hwp
			  Do not enable hardware P state control (HWP)
			  if available.
			hwp_only
			  Only load intel_pstate on systems which support
			  hardware P state control (HWP) if available.
			support_acpi_ppc
			  Enforce ACPI _PPC performance limits. If the Fixed ACPI
			  Description Table, specifies preferred power management
			  profile as "Enterprise Server" or "Performance Server",
			  then this feature is turned on by default.
			per_cpu_perf_limits
			  Allow per-logical-CPU P-State performance control limits using
			  cpufreq sysfs interface

	intremap=	[X86-64, Intel-IOMMU]
			on	enable Interrupt Remapping (default)

	iommu.strict=	[ARM64] Configure TLB invalidation behaviour
			Format: { "0" | "1" }
			0 - Lazy mode.
			  Request that DMA unmap operations use deferred
			  invalidation of hardware TLBs, for increased
			  throughput at the cost of reduced device isolation.
			  Will fall back to strict mode if not supported by
			  the relevant IOMMU driver.
			1 - Strict mode (default).
			  DMA unmap operations invalidate IOMMU hardware TLBs
			  synchronously.

	iommu.passthrough=
			[ARM64] Configure DMA to bypass the IOMMU by default.
			Format: { "0" | "1" }

			of a GICv2 controller even if the memory range
			exposed by the device tree is too small.

	irqchip.gicv3_nolpi=
			[ARM, ARM64]
			Force the kernel to ignore the availability of
			LPIs (and by consequence ITSs). Intended for system
			that use the kernel as a bootloader, and thus want
			to let secondary kernels in charge of setting up
			LPIs.

	irqchip.gicv3_pseudo_nmi= [ARM64]
			Enables support for pseudo-NMIs in the kernel. This
			requires the kernel to be built with
			CONFIG_ARM64_PSEUDO_NMI.

	irqfixup	[HW]
			When an interrupt is not handled search all handlers
			for it. Intended to get systems with badly broken
			firmware running.

	isapnp=		[ISAPNP]
			Format: <RDP>,<reset>,<pci_scan>,<verbosity>

	isolcpus=	[KNL,SMP,ISOL] Isolate a given set of CPUs from disturbance.
			[Deprecated - use cpusets instead]
			Format: [flag-list,]<cpu-list>

			Specify one or more CPUs to isolate from disturbances
			specified in the flag list (default: domain):

			nohz
			  Disable the tick when a single task runs.

			  A residual 1Hz tick is offloaded to workqueues, which you
			  need to affine to housekeeping through the global
			  workqueue's affinity configured via the
			  /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue/cpumask sysfs file, or
			  by using the 'domain' flag described below.

			  NOTE: by default the global workqueue runs on all CPUs,
			  so to protect individual CPUs the 'cpumask' file has to
			  be configured manually after bootup.

			domain
			  Isolate from the general SMP balancing and scheduling
			  algorithms. Note that performing domain isolation this way
			  is irreversible: it's not possible to bring back a CPU to
			  the domains once isolated through isolcpus. It's strongly
			  advised to use cpusets instead to disable scheduler load
			  balancing through the "cpuset.sched_load_balance" file.
			  It offers a much more flexible interface where CPUs can
			  move in and out of an isolated set anytime.

			  You can move a process onto or off an "isolated" CPU via
			  the CPU affinity syscalls or cpuset.
			  <cpu number> begins at 0 and the maximum value is
			  "number of CPUs in system - 1".

			The format of <cpu-list> is described above.



	iucv=		[HW,NET]

	ivrs_ioapic	[HW,X86_64]
			Provide an override to the IOAPIC-ID<->DEVICE-ID
			mapping provided in the IVRS ACPI table. For
			example, to map IOAPIC-ID decimal 10 to
			PCI device 00:14.0 write the parameter as:
				ivrs_ioapic[10]=00:14.0

	ivrs_hpet	[HW,X86_64]
			Provide an override to the HPET-ID<->DEVICE-ID
			mapping provided in the IVRS ACPI table. For
			example, to map HPET-ID decimal 0 to
			PCI device 00:14.0 write the parameter as:
				ivrs_hpet[0]=00:14.0

	ivrs_acpihid	[HW,X86_64]
			Provide an override to the ACPI-HID:UID<->DEVICE-ID
			mapping provided in the IVRS ACPI table. For
			example, to map UART-HID:UID AMD0020:0 to
			PCI device 00:14.5 write the parameter as:
				ivrs_acpihid[00:14.5]=AMD0020:0

	js=		[HW,JOY] Analog joystick

			Layout Randomization).

	kasan_multi_shot
			[KNL] Enforce KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer) to print
			report on every invalid memory access. Without this
			parameter KASAN will print report only for the first

	keepinitrd	[HW,ARM]

	kernelcore=	[KNL,X86,IA-64,PPC]
			Format: nn[KMGTPE] | nn% | "mirror"
			This parameter specifies the amount of memory usable by
			the kernel for non-movable allocations.  The requested
			amount is spread evenly throughout all nodes in the
			system as ZONE_NORMAL.  The remaining memory is used for
			movable memory in its own zone, ZONE_MOVABLE.  In the
			event, a node is too small to have both ZONE_NORMAL and
			ZONE_MOVABLE, kernelcore memory will take priority and
			other nodes will have a larger ZONE_MOVABLE.

			ZONE_MOVABLE is used for the allocation of pages that
			may be reclaimed or moved by the page migration
			subsystem.  Note that allocations like PTEs-from-HighMem
			still use the HighMem zone if it exists, and the Normal
			zone if it does not.

			It is possible to specify the exact amount of memory in
			the form of "nn[KMGTPE]", a percentage of total system
			memory in the form of "nn%", or "mirror".  If "mirror"
			option is specified, mirrored (reliable) memory is used
			for non-movable allocations and remaining memory is used
			for Movable pages.  "nn[KMGTPE]", "nn%", and "mirror"
			are exclusive, so you cannot specify multiple forms.

	kgdbdbgp=	[KGDB,HW] kgdb over EHCI usb debug port.
			Format: <Controller#>[,poll interval]
			The controller # is the number of the ehci usb debug
			port as it is probed via PCI.  The poll interval is
			optional and is the number seconds in between
			each poll cycle to the debug port in case you need
			the functionality for interrupting the kernel with
			gdb or control-c on the dbgp connection.  When
			not using this parameter you use sysrq-g to break into
			the kernel debugger.

	kgdboc=		[KGDB,HW] kgdb over consoles.

			      affected CPUs

			The kernel PTE inversion protection is unconditionally
			enabled and cannot be disabled.

			full
				Provides all available mitigations for the
				L1TF vulnerability. Disables SMT and
				enables all mitigations in the
				hypervisors, i.e. unconditional L1D flush.

				SMT control and L1D flush control via the

				boot.  Hypervisors will issue a warning
				when the first VM is started in a
				potentially insecure configuration,
				i.e. SMT enabled or L1D flush disabled.

			full,force
				Same as 'full', but disables SMT and L1D
				flush runtime control. Implies the
				'nosmt=force' command line option.
				(i.e. sysfs control of SMT is disabled.)

			flush
				Leaves SMT enabled and enables the default
				hypervisor mitigation, i.e. conditional
				L1D flush.

				SMT control and L1D flush control via the

			value for LAPIC timer one-shot implementation. Default
			back to the programmable timer unit in the LAPIC.

	lapic_timer_c2_ok	[X86,APIC] trust the local apic timer
			in C2 power state.

	libata.dma=	[LIBATA] DMA control
			libata.dma=0	  Disable all PATA and SATA DMA
			libata.dma=1	  PATA and SATA Disk DMA only
			libata.dma=2	  ATAPI (CDROM) DMA only
			libata.dma=4	  Compact Flash DMA only
			Combinations also work, so libata.dma=3 enables DMA
			for disks and CDROMs, but not CFs.

	libata.ignore_hpa=	[LIBATA] Ignore HPA limit

			when set.
			Format: <int>

	libata.force=	[LIBATA] Force configurations.  The format is comma
			separated list of "[ID:]VAL" where ID is
			PORT[.DEVICE].  PORT and DEVICE are decimal numbers
			matching port, link or device.  Basically, it matches
			the ATA ID string printed on console by libata.  If
			the whole ID part is omitted, the last PORT and DEVICE
			values are used.  If ID hasn't been specified yet, the
			configuration applies to all ports, links and devices.

			If only DEVICE is omitted, the parameter applies to
			the port and all links and devices behind it.  DEVICE
			number of 0 either selects the first device or the
			first fan-out link behind PMP device.  It does not
			select the host link.  DEVICE number of 15 selects the
			host link and device attached to it.

			The VAL specifies the configuration to force.  As long
			as there's no ambiguity shortcut notation is allowed.
			For example, both 1.5 and 1.5G would work for 1.5Gbps.
			The following configurations can be forced.

			* Cable type: 40c, 80c, short40c, unk, ign or sata.
			  Any ID with matching PORT is used.

			* SATA link speed limit: 1.5Gbps or 3.0Gbps.

			* Transfer mode: pio[0-7], mwdma[0-4] and udma[0-7].
			  udma[/][16,25,33,44,66,100,133] notation is also
			  allowed.

			* [no]ncq: Turn on or off NCQ.

			* [no]ncqtrim: Turn off queued DSM TRIM.

			* nohrst, nosrst, norst: suppress hard, soft
			  and both resets.

			* rstonce: only attempt one reset during
			  hot-unplug link recovery

			* dump_id: dump IDENTIFY data.

			* atapi_dmadir: Enable ATAPI DMADIR bridge support

			* disable: Disable this device.

			If there are multiple matching configurations changing
			the same attribute, the last one is used.

			Set time (s) between CPU-hotplug operations, or
			zero to disable CPU-hotplug testing.

	locktorture.shuffle_interval= [KNL]
			Set task-shuffle interval (jiffies).  Shuffling
			tasks allows some CPUs to go into dyntick-idle
			mode during the locktorture test.

			Set time (s) after boot system shutdown.  This
			is useful for hands-off automated testing.

	locktorture.stat_interval= [KNL]
			Time (s) between statistics printk()s.

	locktorture.stutter= [KNL]
			Time (s) to stutter testing, for example,

	logibm.irq=	[HW,MOUSE] Logitech Bus Mouse Driver
			Format: <irq>

	loglevel=	All Kernel Messages with a loglevel smaller than the
			console loglevel will be printed to the console. It can
			also be changed with klogd or other programs. The
			loglevels are defined as follows:

			0 (KERN_EMERG)		system is unusable
			1 (KERN_ALERT)		action must be taken immediately
			2 (KERN_CRIT)		critical conditions
			3 (KERN_ERR)		error conditions
			4 (KERN_WARNING)	warning conditions
			5 (KERN_NOTICE)		normal but significant condition
			6 (KERN_INFO)		informational
			7 (KERN_DEBUG)		debug-level messages

	log_buf_len=n[KMG]	Sets the size of the printk ring buffer,
			in bytes.  n must be a power of two and greater
			than the minimal size. The minimal size is defined
			by LOG_BUF_SHIFT kernel config parameter. There is
			also CONFIG_LOG_CPU_MAX_BUF_SHIFT config parameter
			that allows to increase the default size depending on
			the number of CPUs. See init/Kconfig for more details.

	logo.nologo	[FB] Disables display of the built-in Linux logo.
			This may be used to provide more screen space for
			kernel log messages and is useful when debugging
			kernel boot problems.

	lp=0		[LP]	Specify parallel ports to use, e.g,
	lp=port[,port...]	lp=none,parport0 (lp0 not configured, lp1 uses
	lp=reset		first parallel port). 'lp=0' disables the
	lp=auto			printer driver. 'lp=reset' (which can be
				specified in addition to the ports) causes
				attached printers to be reset. Using
				lp=port1,port2,... specifies the parallel ports
				to associate lp devices with, starting with
				lp0. A port specification may be 'none' to skip
				that lp device, or a parport name such as
				'parport0'. Specifying 'lp=auto' instead of a
				port specification list means that device IDs
				from each port should be examined, to see if
				an IEEE 1284-compliant printer is attached; if
				so, the driver will manage that printer.
				See also header of drivers/char/lp.c.

	lpj=n		[KNL]
			Sets loops_per_jiffy to given constant, thus avoiding
			time-consuming boot-time autodetection (up to 250 ms per
			CPU). 0 enables autodetection (default). To determine
			the correct value for your kernel, boot with normal
			autodetection and see what value is printed. Note that
			on SMP systems the preset will be applied to all CPUs,
			which is likely to cause problems if your CPUs need
			significantly divergent settings. An incorrect value
			will cause delays in the kernel to be wrong, leading to
			unpredictable I/O errors and other breakage. Although
			unlikely, in the extreme case this might damage your
			hardware.

	ltpc=		[NET]
			Format: <io>,<irq>,<dma>

	lsm.debug	[SECURITY] Enable LSM initialization debugging output.

	lsm=lsm1,...,lsmN
			[SECURITY] Choose order of LSM initialization. This
			overrides CONFIG_LSM, and the "security=" parameter.

	machvec=	[IA-64] Force the use of a particular machine-vector
			(machvec) in a generic kernel.
			Example: machvec=hpzx1_swiotlb

	machtype=	[Loongson] Share the same kernel image file between different
			 yeeloong laptop.
			Example: machtype=lemote-yeeloong-2f-7inch

	max_addr=nn[KMG]	[KNL,BOOT,ia64] All physical memory greater
			than or equal to this physical address is ignored.

	maxcpus=	[SMP] Maximum number of processors that	an SMP kernel
			will bring up during bootup.  maxcpus=n : n >= 0 limits
			the kernel to bring up 'n' processors. Surely after
			bootup you can bring up the other plugged cpu by executing
			"echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/online". So maxcpus
			only takes effect during system bootup.
			While n=0 is a special case, it is equivalent to "nosmp",
			which also disables the IO APIC.

	max_loop=	[LOOP] The number of loop block devices that get
	(loop.max_loop)	unconditionally pre-created at init time. The default
			number is configured by BLK_DEV_LOOP_MIN_COUNT. Instead
			of statically allocating a predefined number, loop
			devices can be requested on-demand with the
			/dev/loop-control interface.

	mdacon=		[MDA]
			Format: <first>,<last>
			Specifies range of consoles to be captured by the MDA.

	mds=		[X86,INTEL]
			Control mitigation for the Micro-architectural Data
			Sampling (MDS) vulnerability.

			Certain CPUs are vulnerable to an exploit against CPU
			internal buffers which can forward information to a
			disclosure gadget under certain conditions.

			In vulnerable processors, the speculatively
			forwarded data can be used in a cache side channel
			attack, to access data to which the attacker does
			not have direct access.

			This parameter controls the MDS mitigation. The
			options are:

			full       - Enable MDS mitigation on vulnerable CPUs
			full,nosmt - Enable MDS mitigation and disable
				     SMT on vulnerable CPUs
			off        - Unconditionally disable MDS mitigation

			Not specifying this option is equivalent to
			mds=full.

			For details see: Documentation/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.rst

	mem=nn[KMG]	[KNL,BOOT] Force usage of a specific amount of memory
			Amount of memory to be used when the kernel is not able
			to see the whole system memory or for test.
			[X86] Work as limiting max address. Use together
			with memmap= to avoid physical address space collisions.
			Without memmap= PCI devices could be placed at addresses
			belonging to unused RAM.

	mem=nopentium	[BUGS=X86-32] Disable usage of 4MB pages for kernel
			memory.

	memchunk=nn[KMG]
			[KNL,SH] Allow user to override the default size for
			per-device physically contiguous DMA buffers.

	memhp_default_state=online/offline
			[KNL] Set the initial state for the memory hotplug
			onlining policy. If not specified, the default value is
			set according to the
			CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG_DEFAULT_ONLINE kernel config
			option.
			See Documentation/memory-hotplug.txt.

	memmap=exactmap	[KNL,X86] Enable setting of an exact
			E820 memory map, as specified by the user.
			Such memmap=exactmap lines can be constructed based on
			BIOS output or other requirements. See the memmap=nn@ss
			option description.

	memmap=nn[KMG]@ss[KMG]
			[KNL] Force usage of a specific region of memory.
			Region of memory to be used is from ss to ss+nn.
			If @ss[KMG] is omitted, it is equivalent to mem=nn[KMG],
			which limits max address to nn[KMG].
			Multiple different regions can be specified,
			comma delimited.
			Example:
				memmap=100M@2G,100M#3G,1G!1024G

	memmap=nn[KMG]#ss[KMG]
			[KNL,ACPI] Mark specific memory as ACPI data.
			Region of memory to be marked is from ss to ss+nn.

	memmap=nn[KMG]$ss[KMG]
			[KNL,ACPI] Mark specific memory as reserved.
			Region of memory to be reserved is from ss to ss+nn.
			Example: Exclude memory from 0x18690000-0x1869ffff
			         memmap=64K$0x18690000
			         or
			         memmap=0x10000$0x18690000
			Some bootloaders may need an escape character before '$',
			like Grub2, otherwise '$' and the following number
			will be eaten.

	memmap=nn[KMG]!ss[KMG]
			[KNL,X86] Mark specific memory as protected.
			Region of memory to be used, from ss to ss+nn.
			The memory region may be marked as e820 type 12 (0xc)
			and is NVDIMM or ADR memory.

	memmap=<size>%<offset>-<oldtype>+<newtype>
			[KNL,ACPI] Convert memory within the specified region
			from <oldtype> to <newtype>. If "-<oldtype>" is left
			out, the whole region will be marked as <newtype>,
			even if previously unavailable. If "+<newtype>" is left
			out, matching memory will be removed. Types are
			specified as e820 types, e.g., 1 = RAM, 2 = reserved,
			3 = ACPI, 12 = PRAM.

	memory_corruption_check=0/1 [X86]
			Some BIOSes seem to corrupt the first 64k of
			memory when doing things like suspend/resume.
			Setting this option will scan the memory
			looking for corruption.  Enabling this will
			both detect corruption and prevent the kernel
			from using the memory being corrupted.
			However, its intended as a diagnostic tool; if
			repeatable BIOS-originated corruption always
			affects the same memory, you can use memmap=
			to prevent the kernel from using that memory.

	memory_corruption_check_size=size [X86]
			By default it checks for corruption in the low
			64k, making this memory unavailable for normal
			use.  Use this parameter to scan for
			corruption in more or less memory.

	memory_corruption_check_period=seconds [X86]
			By default it checks for corruption every 60
			seconds.  Use this parameter to check at some
			other rate.  0 disables periodic checking.

	memtest=	[KNL,X86,ARM,PPC] Enable memtest
			Format: <integer>
			default : 0 <disable>
			Specifies the number of memtest passes to be
			performed. Each pass selects another test
			pattern from a given set of patterns. Memtest
			fills the memory with this pattern, validates
			memory contents and reserves bad memory
			regions that are detected.

	mem_encrypt=	[X86-64] AMD Secure Memory Encryption (SME) control
			Valid arguments: on, off
			Default (depends on kernel configuration option):
			  on  (CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT_ACTIVE_BY_DEFAULT=y)
			  off (CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT_ACTIVE_BY_DEFAULT=n)
			mem_encrypt=on:		Activate SME
			mem_encrypt=off:	Do not activate SME

			Refer to Documentation/x86/amd-memory-encryption.txt
			for details on when memory encryption can be activated.

	mem_sleep_default=	[SUSPEND] Default system suspend mode:
			s2idle  - Suspend-To-Idle
			shallow - Power-On Suspend or equivalent (if supported)
			deep    - Suspend-To-RAM or equivalent (if supported)
			See Documentation/admin-guide/pm/sleep-states.rst.

	meye.*=		[HW] Set MotionEye Camera parameters
			See Documentation/media/v4l-drivers/meye.rst.

	mfgpt_irq=	[IA-32] Specify the IRQ to use for the
			Multi-Function General Purpose Timers on AMD Geode
			platforms.

	mfgptfix	[X86-32] Fix MFGPT timers on AMD Geode platforms when
			the BIOS has incorrectly applied a workaround. TinyBIOS
			version 0.98 is known to be affected, 0.99 fixes the
			problem by letting the user disable the workaround.

	mga=		[HW,DRM]

	min_addr=nn[KMG]	[KNL,BOOT,ia64] All physical memory below this
			physical address is ignored.

	mini2440=	[ARM,HW,KNL]
			Format:[0..2][b][c][t]
			Default: "0tb"
			MINI2440 configuration specification:
			0 - The attached screen is the 3.5" TFT
			1 - The attached screen is the 7" TFT
			2 - The VGA Shield is attached (1024x768)
			Leaving out the screen size parameter will not load
			the TFT driver, and the framebuffer will be left
			unconfigured.
			b - Enable backlight. The TFT backlight pin will be
			linked to the kernel VESA blanking code and a GPIO
			LED. This parameter is not necessary when using the
			VGA shield.
			c - Enable the s3c camera interface.
			t - Reserved for enabling touchscreen support. The
			touchscreen support is not enabled in the mainstream
			kernel as of 2.6.30, a preliminary port can be found
			in the "bleeding edge" mini2440 support kernel at
			http://repo.or.cz/w/linux-2.6/mini2440.git

	mitigations=
			[X86,PPC,S390,ARM64] Control optional mitigations for
			CPU vulnerabilities.  This is a set of curated,
			arch-independent options, each of which is an
			aggregation of existing arch-specific options.

				improves system performance, but it may also
				expose users to several CPU vulnerabilities.
				Equivalent to: nopti [X86,PPC]

					       mds=off [X86]

			auto (default)
				Mitigate all CPU vulnerabilities, but leave SMT
				enabled, even if it's vulnerable.  This is for
				users who don't want to be surprised by SMT
				getting disabled across kernel upgrades, or who
				have other ways of avoiding SMT-based attacks.
				Equivalent to: (default behavior)

			auto,nosmt
				Mitigate all CPU vulnerabilities, disabling SMT
				if needed.  This is for users who always want to
				be fully mitigated, even if it means losing SMT.
				Equivalent to: l1tf=flush,nosmt [X86]
					       mds=full,nosmt [X86]

	mminit_loglevel=
			[KNL] When CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMORY_INIT is set, this
			parameter allows control of the logging verbosity for
			the additional memory initialisation checks. A value
			of 0 disables mminit logging and a level of 4 will
			log everything. Information is printed at KERN_DEBUG
			so loglevel=8 may also need to be specified.

	module.sig_enforce
			[KNL] When CONFIG_MODULE_SIG is set, this means that
			modules without (valid) signatures will fail to load.
			Note that if CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE is set, that
			is always true, so this option does nothing.

	module_blacklist=  [KNL] Do not load a comma-separated list of
			modules.  Useful for debugging problem modules.

	mousedev.tap_time=

	movablecore=	[KNL,X86,IA-64,PPC]
			Format: nn[KMGTPE] | nn%
			This parameter is the complement to kernelcore=, it
			specifies the amount of memory used for migratable
			allocations.  If both kernelcore and movablecore is
			specified, then kernelcore will be at *least* the
			specified value but may be more.  If movablecore on its
			own is specified, the administrator must be careful
			that the amount of memory usable for all allocations
			is not too small.

	movable_node	[KNL] Boot-time switch to make hotplugable memory
			NUMA nodes to be movable. This means that the memory
			of such nodes will be usable only for movable
			allocations which rules out almost all kernel
			allocations. Use with caution!

	MTD_Partition=	[MTD]
			Format: <name>,<region-number>,<size>,<offset>

			Default value is 0.

	nfsaddrs=	[NFS] Deprecated.  Use ip= instead.
			See Documentation/filesystems/nfs/nfsroot.txt.

	nfsroot=	[NFS] nfs root filesystem for disk-less boxes.
			See Documentation/filesystems/nfs/nfsroot.txt.

	nfsrootdebug	[NFS] enable nfsroot debugging messages.
			See Documentation/filesystems/nfs/nfsroot.txt.

	nfs.callback_nr_threads=
			[NFSv4] set the total number of threads that the
			NFS client will assign to service NFSv4 callback
			requests.

	nfs.callback_tcpport=
			[NFS] set the TCP port on which the NFSv4 callback
			channel should listen.

	nfs.cache_getent=
			[NFS] sets the pathname to the program which is used
			to update the NFS client cache entries.

	nfs.cache_getent_timeout=
			[NFS] sets the timeout after which an attempt to
			update a cache entry is deemed to have failed.

	nfs.idmap_cache_timeout=
			[NFS] set the maximum lifetime for idmapper cache
			entries.

	nfs.enable_ino64=
			[NFS] enable 64-bit inode numbers.
			If zero, the NFS client will fake up a 32-bit inode
			number for the readdir() and stat() syscalls instead
			of returning the full 64-bit number.
			The default is to return 64-bit inode numbers.

	nfs.max_session_cb_slots=
			[NFSv4.1] Sets the maximum number of session
			slots the client will assign to the callback
			channel. This determines the maximum number of
			callbacks the client will process in parallel for
			a particular server.

	nfs.max_session_slots=
			[NFSv4.1] Sets the maximum number of session slots
			the client will attempt to negotiate with the server.
			This limits the number of simultaneous RPC requests
			that the client can send to the NFSv4.1 server.
			Note that there is little point in setting this
			value higher than the max_tcp_slot_table_limit.

	nfs.nfs4_disable_idmapping=
			[NFSv4] When set to the default of '1', this option
			ensures that both the RPC level authentication
			scheme and the NFS level operations agree to use
			numeric uids/gids if the mount is using the
			'sec=sys' security flavour. In effect it is
			disabling idmapping, which can make migration from
			legacy NFSv2/v3 systems to NFSv4 easier.
			Servers that do not support this mode of operation
			will be autodetected by the client, and it will fall
			back to using the idmapper.
			To turn off this behaviour, set the value to '0'.
	nfs.nfs4_unique_id=
			[NFS4] Specify an additional fixed unique ident-
			ification string that NFSv4 clients can insert into
			their nfs_client_id4 string.  This is typically a
			UUID that is generated at system install time.

	nfs.send_implementation_id =
			[NFSv4.1] Send client implementation identification
			information in exchange_id requests.
			If zero, no implementation identification information
			will be sent.
			The default is to send the implementation identification
			information.

	nfs.recover_lost_locks =
			[NFSv4] Attempt to recover locks that were lost due
			to a lease timeout on the server. Please note that
			doing this risks data corruption, since there are
			no guarantees that the file will remain unchanged
			after the locks are lost.
			If you want to enable the kernel legacy behaviour of
			attempting to recover these locks, then set this
			parameter to '1'.
			The default parameter value of '0' causes the kernel
			not to attempt recovery of lost locks.

	nfs4.layoutstats_timer =
			[NFSv4.2] Change the rate at which the kernel sends
			layoutstats to the pNFS metadata server.

			Setting this to value to 0 causes the kernel to use
			whatever value is the default set by the layout
			driver. A non-zero value sets the minimum interval
			in seconds between layoutstats transmissions.

	nfsd.nfs4_disable_idmapping=
			[NFSv4] When set to the default of '1', the NFSv4
			server will return only numeric uids and gids to
			clients using auth_sys, and will accept numeric uids
			and gids from such clients.  This is intended to ease
			migration from NFSv2/v3.

	nmi_debug=	[KNL,SH] Specify one or more actions to take
			when a NMI is triggered.
			Format: [state][,regs][,debounce][,die]

	nmi_watchdog=	[KNL,BUGS=X86] Debugging features for SMP kernels
			Format: [panic,][nopanic,][num]
			Valid num: 0 or 1
			0 - turn hardlockup detector in nmi_watchdog off
			1 - turn hardlockup detector in nmi_watchdog on
			When panic is specified, panic when an NMI watchdog
			timeout occurs (or 'nopanic' to override the opposite
			default). To disable both hard and soft lockup detectors,
			please see 'nowatchdog'.
			This is useful when you use a panic=... timeout and
			need the box quickly up again.

			These settings can be accessed at runtime via
			the nmi_watchdog and hardlockup_panic sysctls.

	netpoll.carrier_timeout=
			[NET] Specifies amount of time (in seconds) that
			netpoll should wait for a carrier. By default netpoll
			waits 4 seconds.

	no387		[BUGS=X86-32] Tells the kernel to use the 387 maths
			emulation library even if a 387 maths coprocessor
			is present.

	no5lvl		[X86-64] Disable 5-level paging mode. Forces
			kernel to use 4-level paging instead.

	no_console_suspend
			[HW] Never suspend the console
			Disable suspending of consoles during suspend and
			hibernate operations.  Once disabled, debugging
			messages can reach various consoles while the rest
			of the system is being put to sleep (ie, while
			debugging driver suspend/resume hooks).  This may
			not work reliably with all consoles, but is known
			to work with serial and VGA consoles.
			To facilitate more flexible debugging, we also add
			console_suspend, a printk module parameter to control
			it. Users could use console_suspend (usually
			/sys/module/printk/parameters/console_suspend) to
			turn on/off it dynamically.

	noaliencache	[MM, NUMA, SLAB] Disables the allocation of alien
			caches in the slab allocator.  Saves per-node memory,
			but will impact performance.

	noalign		[KNL,ARM]

	noaltinstr	[S390] Disables alternative instructions patching
			(CPU alternatives feature).

	noapic		[SMP,APIC] Tells the kernel to not make use of any
			IOAPICs that may be present in the system.

	noautogroup	Disable scheduler automatic task group creation.

	nobats		[PPC] Do not use BATs for mapping kernel lowmem
			on "Classic" PPC cores.

	nocache		[ARM]

	noclflush	[BUGS=X86] Don't use the CLFLUSH instruction

	nodelayacct	[KNL] Disable per-task delay accounting

	nodsp		[SH] Disable hardware DSP at boot time.

	noefi		Disable EFI runtime services support.

	noexec		[IA-64]

	noexec		[X86]
			On X86-32 available only on PAE configured kernels.
			noexec=on: enable non-executable mappings (default)
			noexec=off: disable non-executable mappings

	nosmap		[X86,PPC]
			Disable SMAP (Supervisor Mode Access Prevention)
			even if it is supported by processor.

	nosmep		[X86,PPC]
			Disable SMEP (Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention)
			even if it is supported by processor.

	noexec32	[X86-64]
			This affects only 32-bit executables.
			noexec32=on: enable non-executable mappings (default)
				read doesn't imply executable mappings
			noexec32=off: disable non-executable mappings
				read implies executable mappings

	nofpu		[MIPS,SH] Disable hardware FPU at boot time.

	nofxsr		[BUGS=X86-32] Disables x86 floating point extended
			register save and restore. The kernel will only save
			legacy floating-point registers on task switch.

	nohugeiomap	[KNL,x86] Disable kernel huge I/O mappings.

	nosmt		[KNL,S390] Disable symmetric multithreading (SMT).
			Equivalent to smt=1.

			[KNL,x86] Disable symmetric multithreading (SMT).
			nosmt=force: Force disable SMT, cannot be undone
				     via the sysfs control file.

	nospectre_v1	[PPC] Disable mitigations for Spectre Variant 1 (bounds
			check bypass). With this option data leaks are possible
			in the system.

	nospectre_v2	[X86,PPC_FSL_BOOK3E,ARM64] Disable all mitigations for
			the Spectre variant 2 (indirect branch prediction)
			vulnerability. System may allow data leaks with this
			option.

	nospec_store_bypass_disable
			[HW] Disable all mitigations for the Speculative Store Bypass vulnerability

	noxsave		[BUGS=X86] Disables x86 extended register state save
			and restore using xsave. The kernel will fallback to
			enabling legacy floating-point and sse state.

	noxsaveopt	[X86] Disables xsaveopt used in saving x86 extended
			register states. The kernel will fall back to use
			xsave to save the states. By using this parameter,
			performance of saving the states is degraded because
			xsave doesn't support modified optimization while
			xsaveopt supports it on xsaveopt enabled systems.

	noxsaves	[X86] Disables xsaves and xrstors used in saving and
			restoring x86 extended register state in compacted
			form of xsave area. The kernel will fall back to use
			xsaveopt and xrstor to save and restore the states
			in standard form of xsave area. By using this
			parameter, xsave area per process might occupy more
			memory on xsaves enabled systems.

	nohlt		[BUGS=ARM,SH] Tells the kernel that the sleep(SH) or
			wfi(ARM) instruction doesn't work correctly and not to
			use it. This is also useful when using JTAG debugger.

	no_file_caps	Tells the kernel not to honor file capabilities.  The
			only way then for a file to be executed with privilege
			is to be setuid root or executed by root.

	nohalt		[IA-64] Tells the kernel not to use the power saving
			function PAL_HALT_LIGHT when idle. This increases
			power-consumption. On the positive side, it reduces
			interrupt wake-up latency, which may improve performance
			in certain environments such as networked servers or
			real-time systems.

	nohibernate	[HIBERNATION] Disable hibernation and resume.

	nohz=		[KNL] Boottime enable/disable dynamic ticks
			Valid arguments: on, off
			Default: on

	nohz_full=	[KNL,BOOT,SMP,ISOL]
			The argument is a cpu list, as described above.
			In kernels built with CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL=y, set
			the specified list of CPUs whose tick will be stopped
			whenever possible. The boot CPU will be forced outside
			the range to maintain the timekeeping.  Any CPUs
			in this list will have their RCU callbacks offloaded,
			just as if they had also been called out in the
			rcu_nocbs= boot parameter.

	noiotrap	[SH] Disables trapped I/O port accesses.

	noirqdebug	[X86-32] Disables the code which attempts to detect and
			disable unhandled interrupt sources.

			broken timer IRQ sources.

	noisapnp	[ISAPNP] Disables ISA PnP code.

	noinitrd	[RAM] Tells the kernel not to load any configured
			initial RAM disk.

	nointremap	[X86-64, Intel-IOMMU] Do not enable interrupt
			remapping.
			[Deprecated - use intremap=off]

	nointroute	[IA-64]

	noinvpcid	[X86] Disable the INVPCID cpu feature.

	nojitter	[IA-64] Disables jitter checking for ITC timers.

			fault handling.

	no-vmw-sched-clock
			[X86,PV_OPS] Disable paravirtualized VMware scheduler
			clock and use the default one.

	no-steal-acc	[X86,KVM] Disable paravirtualized steal time accounting.
			steal time is computed, but won't influence scheduler
			behaviour

	nolapic		[X86-32,APIC] Do not enable or use the local APIC.

	nolapic_timer	[X86-32,APIC] Do not use the local APIC timer.

	noltlbs		[PPC] Do not use large page/tlb entries for kernel
			lowmem mapping on PPC40x and PPC8xx

	nomca		[IA-64] Disable machine check abort handling

	nomce		[X86-32] Disable Machine Check Exception

	nomfgpt		[X86-32] Disable Multi-Function General Purpose
			Timer usage (for AMD Geode machines).

	nonmi_ipi	[X86] Disable using NMI IPIs during panic/reboot to
			shutdown the other cpus.  Instead use the REBOOT_VECTOR
			irq.

	nomodule	Disable module load

	nopat		[X86] Disable PAT (page attribute table extension of
			pagetables) support.

	nopcid		[X86-64] Disable the PCID cpu feature.

	norandmaps	Don't use address space randomization.  Equivalent to
			echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

	noreplace-smp	[X86-32,SMP] Don't replace SMP instructions
			with UP alternatives

	nordrand	[X86] Disable kernel use of the RDRAND and
			RDSEED instructions even if they are supported
			by the processor.  RDRAND and RDSEED are still
			available to user space applications.

	noresume	[SWSUSP] Disables resume and restores original swap
			space.

	no-scroll	[VGA] Disables scrollback.
			This is required for the Braillex ib80-piezo Braille
			reader made by F.H. Papenmeier (Germany).

	nosbagart	[IA-64]

	nosep		[BUGS=X86-32] Disables x86 SYSENTER/SYSEXIT support.

	nosmp		[SMP] Tells an SMP kernel to act as a UP kernel,
			and disable the IO APIC.  legacy for "maxcpus=0".

	nosoftlockup	[KNL] Disable the soft-lockup detector.

	nosync		[HW,M68K] Disables sync negotiation for all devices.

	nowatchdog	[KNL] Disable both lockup detectors, i.e.
			soft-lockup and NMI watchdog (hard-lockup).

	nowb		[ARM]

	nox2apic	[X86-64,APIC] Do not enable x2APIC mode.

	cpu0_hotplug	[X86] Turn on CPU0 hotplug feature when
			CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HOTPLUG_CPU0 is off.
			Some features depend on CPU0. Known dependencies are:
			1. Resume from suspend/hibernate depends on CPU0.
			Suspend/hibernate will fail if CPU0 is offline and you
			need to online CPU0 before suspend/hibernate.
			2. PIC interrupts also depend on CPU0. CPU0 can't be
			removed if a PIC interrupt is detected.
			It's said poweroff/reboot may depend on CPU0 on some
			machines although I haven't seen such issues so far
			after CPU0 is offline on a few tested machines.
			If the dependencies are under your control, you can
			turn on cpu0_hotplug.

	nps_mtm_hs_ctr=	[KNL,ARC]
			This parameter sets the maximum duration, in
			cycles, each HW thread of the CTOP can run
			without interruptions, before HW switches it.
			The actual maximum duration is 16 times this
			parameter's value.
			Format: integer between 1 and 255
			Default: 255

	nptcg=		[IA-64] Override max number of concurrent global TLB
			purges which is reported from either PAL_VM_SUMMARY or
			SAL PALO.

	nr_cpus=	[SMP] Maximum number of processors that	an SMP kernel
			could support.  nr_cpus=n : n >= 1 limits the kernel to
			support 'n' processors. It could be larger than the
			number of already plugged CPU during bootup, later in
			runtime you can physically add extra cpu until it reaches
			n. So during boot up some boot time memory for per-cpu
			variables need be pre-allocated for later physical cpu
			hot plugging.

	nr_uarts=	[SERIAL] maximum number of UARTs to be registered.

	numa_balancing=	[KNL,X86] Enable or disable automatic NUMA balancing.
			Allowed values are enable and disable

	numa_zonelist_order= [KNL, BOOT] Select zonelist order for NUMA.
			'node', 'default' can be specified
			This can be set from sysctl after boot.
			See Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt for details.

	ohci1394_dma=early	[HW] enable debugging via the ohci1394 driver.
			See Documentation/debugging-via-ohci1394.txt for more
			info.

	olpc_ec_timeout= [OLPC] ms delay when issuing EC commands
			Rather than timing out after 20 ms if an EC
			command is not properly ACKed, override the length
			of the timeout.  We have interrupts disabled while
			waiting for the ACK, so if this is set too high
			interrupts *may* be lost!

	omap_mux=	[OMAP] Override bootloader pin multiplexing.
			Format: <mux_mode0.mode_name=value>...
			For example, to override I2C bus2:
			omap_mux=i2c2_scl.i2c2_scl=0x100,i2c2_sda.i2c2_sda=0x100

	oprofile.timer=	[HW]
			Use timer interrupt instead of performance counters

	oprofile.cpu_type=	Force an oprofile cpu type
			This might be useful if you have an older oprofile
			userland or if you want common events.
			Format: { arch_perfmon }
			arch_perfmon: [X86] Force use of architectural
				perfmon on Intel CPUs instead of the
				CPU specific event set.
			timer: [X86] Force use of architectural NMI
				timer mode (see also oprofile.timer
				for generic hr timer mode)

	oops=panic	Always panic on oopses. Default is to just kill the
			process, but there is a small probability of
			deadlocking the machine.
			This will also cause panics on machine check exceptions.
			Useful together with panic=30 to trigger a reboot.

	page_alloc.shuffle=
			[KNL] Boolean flag to control whether the page allocator
			should randomize its free lists. The randomization may
			be automatically enabled if the kernel detects it is
			running on a platform with a direct-mapped memory-side
			cache, and this parameter can be used to
			override/disable that behavior. The state of the flag
			can be read from sysfs at:
			/sys/module/page_alloc/parameters/shuffle.

	page_owner=	[KNL] Boot-time page_owner enabling option.
			Storage of the information about who allocated
			each page is disabled in default. With this switch,
			we can turn it on.
			on: enable the feature

	page_poison=	[KNL] Boot-time parameter changing the state of
			poisoning on the buddy allocator, available with
			CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING=y.
			off: turn off poisoning (default)
			on: turn on poisoning

	panic=		[KNL] Kernel behaviour on panic: delay <timeout>
			timeout > 0: seconds before rebooting
			timeout = 0: wait forever
			timeout < 0: reboot immediately
			Format: <timeout>

	panic_print=	Bitmask for printing system info when panic happens.
			User can chose combination of the following bits:
			bit 0: print all tasks info
			bit 1: print system memory info
			bit 2: print timer info
			bit 3: print locks info if CONFIG_LOCKDEP is on
			bit 4: print ftrace buffer
			bit 5: print all printk messages in buffer

	panic_on_warn	panic() instead of WARN().  Useful to cause kdump
			on a WARN().

	crash_kexec_post_notifiers
			Run kdump after running panic-notifiers and dumping
			kmsg. This only for the users who doubt kdump always
			succeeds in any situation.
			Note that this also increases risks of kdump failure,
			because some panic notifiers can make the crashed
			kernel more unstable.

	parkbd.port=	[HW] Parallel port number the keyboard adapter is
			connected to, default is 0.
			Format: <parport#>
	parkbd.mode=	[HW] Parallel port keyboard adapter mode of operation,
			0 for XT, 1 for AT (default is AT).
			Format: <mode>

	parport=	[HW,PPT] Specify parallel ports. 0 disables.
			Format: { 0 | auto | 0xBBB[,IRQ[,DMA]] }
			Use 'auto' to force the driver to use any
			IRQ/DMA settings detected (the default is to
			ignore detected IRQ/DMA settings because of
			possible conflicts). You can specify the base
			address, IRQ, and DMA settings; IRQ and DMA
			should be numbers, or 'auto' (for using detected
			settings on that particular port), or 'nofifo'
			(to avoid using a FIFO even if it is detected).
			Parallel ports are assigned in the order they
			are specified on the command line, starting
			with parport0.

	parport_init_mode=	[HW,PPT]
			Configure VIA parallel port to operate in
			a specific mode. This is necessary on Pegasos
			computer where firmware has no options for setting
			up parallel port mode and sets it to spp.
			Currently this function knows 686a and 8231 chips.
			Format: [spp|ps2|epp|ecp|ecpepp]

	pause_on_oops=
			Halt all CPUs after the first oops has been printed for
			the specified number of seconds.  This is to be used if
			your oopses keep scrolling off the screen.

	pcbit=		[HW,ISDN]

	pcd.		[PARIDE]
			See header of drivers/block/paride/pcd.c.
			See also Documentation/blockdev/paride.txt.

	pci=option[,option...]	[PCI] various PCI subsystem options.

				Some options herein operate on a specific device
				or a set of devices (<pci_dev>). These are
				specified in one of the following formats:

				[<domain>:]<bus>:<dev>.<func>[/<dev>.<func>]*
				pci:<vendor>:<device>[:<subvendor>:<subdevice>]

				Note: the first format specifies a PCI
				bus/device/function address which may change
				if new hardware is inserted, if motherboard
				firmware changes, or due to changes caused
				by other kernel parameters. If the
				domain is left unspecified, it is
				taken to be zero. Optionally, a path
				to a device through multiple device/function
				addresses can be specified after the base
				address (this is more robust against
				renumbering issues).  The second format
				selects devices using IDs from the
				configuration space which may match multiple
				devices in the system.

		earlydump	dump PCI config space before the kernel
				changes anything
		off		[X86] don't probe for the PCI bus
		bios		[X86-32] force use of PCI BIOS, don't access
				the hardware directly. Use this if your machine
				has a non-standard PCI host bridge.
		nobios		[X86-32] disallow use of PCI BIOS, only direct
				hardware access methods are allowed. Use this
				if you experience crashes upon bootup and you
				suspect they are caused by the BIOS.
		conf1		[X86] Force use of PCI Configuration Access
				Mechanism 1 (config address in IO port 0xCF8,
				data in IO port 0xCFC, both 32-bit).
		conf2		[X86] Force use of PCI Configuration Access
				Mechanism 2 (IO port 0xCF8 is an 8-bit port for
				the function, IO port 0xCFA, also 8-bit, sets
				bus number. The config space is then accessed
				through ports 0xC000-0xCFFF).
				See http://wiki.osdev.org/PCI for more info
				on the configuration access mechanisms.
		noaer		[PCIE] If the PCIEAER kernel config parameter is
				enabled, this kernel boot option can be used to
				disable the use of PCIE advanced error reporting.
		nodomains	[PCI] Disable support for multiple PCI
				root domains (aka PCI segments, in ACPI-speak).
		nommconf	[X86] Disable use of MMCONFIG for PCI
				Configuration
		check_enable_amd_mmconf [X86] check for and enable
				properly configured MMIO access to PCI
				config space on AMD family 10h CPU
		nomsi		[MSI] If the PCI_MSI kernel config parameter is
				enabled, this kernel boot option can be used to
				disable the use of MSI interrupts system-wide.
		noioapicquirk	[APIC] Disable all boot interrupt quirks.
				Safety option to keep boot IRQs enabled. This
				should never be necessary.
		ioapicreroute	[APIC] Enable rerouting of boot IRQs to the
				primary IO-APIC for bridges that cannot disable
				boot IRQs. This fixes a source of spurious IRQs
				when the system masks IRQs.
		noioapicreroute	[APIC] Disable workaround that uses the
				boot IRQ equivalent of an IRQ that connects to
				a chipset where boot IRQs cannot be disabled.
				The opposite of ioapicreroute.
		biosirq		[X86-32] Use PCI BIOS calls to get the interrupt
				routing table. These calls are known to be buggy
				on several machines and they hang the machine
				when used, but on other computers it's the only
				way to get the interrupt routing table. Try
				this option if the kernel is unable to allocate
				IRQs or discover secondary PCI buses on your
				motherboard.
		rom		[X86] Assign address space to expansion ROMs.
				Use with caution as certain devices share
				address decoders between ROMs and other
				resources.
		norom		[X86] Do not assign address space to
				expansion ROMs that do not already have
				BIOS assigned address ranges.
		nobar		[X86] Do not assign address space to the
				BARs that weren't assigned by the BIOS.
		irqmask=0xMMMM	[X86] Set a bit mask of IRQs allowed to be
				assigned automatically to PCI devices. You can
				make the kernel exclude IRQs of your ISA cards
				this way.
		pirqaddr=0xAAAAA	[X86] Specify the physical address
				of the PIRQ table (normally generated
				by the BIOS) if it is outside the
				F0000h-100000h range.
		lastbus=N	[X86] Scan all buses thru bus #N. Can be
				useful if the kernel is unable to find your
				secondary buses and you want to tell it
				explicitly which ones they are.
		assign-busses	[X86] Always assign all PCI bus
				numbers ourselves, overriding
				whatever the firmware may have done.
		usepirqmask	[X86] Honor the possible IRQ mask stored
				in the BIOS $PIR table. This is needed on
				some systems with broken BIOSes, notably
				some HP Pavilion N5400 and Omnibook XE3
				notebooks. This will have no effect if ACPI
				IRQ routing is enabled.
		noacpi		[X86] Do not use ACPI for IRQ routing
				or for PCI scanning.
		use_crs		[X86] Use PCI host bridge window information
				from ACPI.  On BIOSes from 2008 or later, this
				is enabled by default.  If you need to use this,
				please report a bug.
		nocrs		[X86] Ignore PCI host bridge windows from ACPI.
				If you need to use this, please report a bug.
		routeirq	Do IRQ routing for all PCI devices.
				This is normally done in pci_enable_device(),
				so this option is a temporary workaround
				for broken drivers that don't call it.
		skip_isa_align	[X86] do not align io start addr, so can
				handle more pci cards
		noearly		[X86] Don't do any early type 1 scanning.
				This might help on some broken boards which
				machine check when some devices' config space
				is read. But various workarounds are disabled
				and some IOMMU drivers will not work.
		bfsort		Sort PCI devices into breadth-first order.
				This sorting is done to get a device
				order compatible with older (<= 2.4) kernels.
		nobfsort	Don't sort PCI devices into breadth-first order.
		pcie_bus_tune_off	Disable PCIe MPS (Max Payload Size)
				tuning and use the BIOS-configured MPS defaults.
		pcie_bus_safe	Set every device's MPS to the largest value
				supported by all devices below the root complex.
		pcie_bus_perf	Set device MPS to the largest allowable MPS
				based on its parent bus. Also set MRRS (Max
				Read Request Size) to the largest supported
				value (no larger than the MPS that the device
				or bus can support) for best performance.
		pcie_bus_peer2peer	Set every device's MPS to 128B, which

				PAGE_SIZE is used as alignment.
				PCI-PCI bridge can be specified, if resource
				windows need to be expanded.
				To specify the alignment for several
				instances of a device, the PCI vendor,
				device, subvendor, and subdevice may be
				specified, e.g., 4096@pci:8086:9c22:103c:198f

				Adding the window is slightly risky (it may
				conflict with unreported devices), so this
				taints the kernel.
		disable_acs_redir=<pci_dev>[; ...]
				Specify one or more PCI devices (in the format
				specified above) separated by semicolons.
				Each device specified will have the PCI ACS
				redirect capabilities forced off which will
				allow P2P traffic between devices through

	rcu_nocbs=	[KNL]
			The argument is a cpu list, as described above,
			except that the string "all" can be used to
			specify every CPU on the system.

			In kernels built with CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU=y, set
			the specified list of CPUs to be no-callback CPUs.
			Invocation of these CPUs' RCU callbacks will be
			offloaded to "rcuox/N" kthreads created for that
			purpose, where "x" is "p" for RCU-preempt, and
			"s" for RCU-sched, and "N" is the CPU number.
			This reduces OS jitter on the offloaded CPUs,
			which can be useful for HPC and real-time
			workloads.  It can also improve energy efficiency
			for asymmetric multiprocessors.

	rcu_nocb_poll	[KNL]
			Rather than requiring that offloaded CPUs
			(specified by rcu_nocbs= above) explicitly
			awaken the corresponding "rcuoN" kthreads,
			make these kthreads poll for callbacks.
			This improves the real-time response for the
			offloaded CPUs by relieving them of the need to
			wake up the corresponding kthread, but degrades
			energy efficiency by requiring that the kthreads
			periodically wake up to do the polling.

	rcutree.blimit=	[KNL]
			Set maximum number of finished RCU callbacks to
			process in one batch.

	rcutree.dump_tree=	[KNL]
			Dump the structure of the rcu_node combining tree
			out at early boot.  This is used for diagnostic
			purposes, to verify correct tree setup.

			Set the number of jiffies to delay each step of
			RCU grace-period cleanup.

	rcutree.gp_init_delay=	[KNL]
			Set the number of jiffies to delay each step of
			RCU grace-period initialization.

	rcutree.gp_preinit_delay=	[KNL]
			Set the number of jiffies to delay each step of
			RCU grace-period pre-initialization, that is,
			the propagation of recent CPU-hotplug changes up
			the rcu_node combining tree.

	rcutree.use_softirq=	[KNL]
			If set to zero, move all RCU_SOFTIRQ processing to
			per-CPU rcuc kthreads.  Defaults to a non-zero
			value, meaning that RCU_SOFTIRQ is used by default.
			Specify rcutree.use_softirq=0 to use rcuc kthreads.

	rcutree.rcu_fanout_exact= [KNL]
			Disable autobalancing of the rcu_node combining
			tree.  This is used by rcutorture, and might
			possibly be useful for architectures having high
			cache-to-cache transfer latencies.

	rcutree.rcu_fanout_leaf= [KNL]
			Change the number of CPUs assigned to each
			leaf rcu_node structure.  Useful for very
			large systems, which will choose the value 64,
			and for NUMA systems with large remote-access
			latencies, which will choose a value aligned
			with the appropriate hardware boundaries.

	rcutree.jiffies_till_first_fqs= [KNL]
			Set delay from grace-period initialization to
			first attempt to force quiescent states.
			Units are jiffies, minimum value is zero,
			and maximum value is HZ.

	rcutree.jiffies_till_next_fqs= [KNL]
			Set delay between subsequent attempts to force
			quiescent states.  Units are jiffies, minimum
			value is one, and maximum value is HZ.

	rcutree.jiffies_till_sched_qs= [KNL]
			Set required age in jiffies for a
			given grace period before RCU starts
			soliciting quiescent-state help from
			rcu_note_context_switch() and cond_resched().
			If not specified, the kernel will calculate
			a value based on the most recent settings
			of rcutree.jiffies_till_first_fqs
			and rcutree.jiffies_till_next_fqs.
			This calculated value may be viewed in
			rcutree.jiffies_to_sched_qs.  Any attempt to set
			rcutree.jiffies_to_sched_qs will be cheerfully
			overwritten.

	rcutree.kthread_prio= 	 [KNL,BOOT]
			Set the SCHED_FIFO priority of the RCU per-CPU
			kthreads (rcuc/N). This value is also used for
			the priority of the RCU boost threads (rcub/N)
			and for the RCU grace-period kthreads (rcu_bh,
			rcu_preempt, and rcu_sched). If RCU_BOOST is
			set, valid values are 1-99 and the default is 1
			(the least-favored priority).  Otherwise, when
			RCU_BOOST is not set, valid values are 0-99 and
			the default is zero (non-realtime operation).

	rcutree.rcu_nocb_leader_stride= [KNL]
			Set the number of NOCB kthread groups, which
			defaults to the square root of the number of
			CPUs.  Larger numbers reduces the wakeup overhead
			on the per-CPU grace-period kthreads, but increases
			that same overhead on each group's leader.

	rcutree.qhimark= [KNL]
			Set threshold of queued RCU callbacks beyond which
			batch limiting is disabled.

	rcutree.qlowmark= [KNL]
			Set threshold of queued RCU callbacks below which
			batch limiting is re-enabled.

	rcutree.rcu_idle_gp_delay= [KNL]
			Set wakeup interval for idle CPUs that have
			RCU callbacks (RCU_FAST_NO_HZ=y).

	rcutree.rcu_idle_lazy_gp_delay= [KNL]
			Set wakeup interval for idle CPUs that have
			only "lazy" RCU callbacks (RCU_FAST_NO_HZ=y).
			Lazy RCU callbacks are those which RCU can
			prove do nothing more than free memory.

	rcutree.rcu_kick_kthreads= [KNL]
			Cause the grace-period kthread to get an extra
			wake_up() if it sleeps three times longer than
			it should at force-quiescent-state time.
			This wake_up() will be accompanied by a
			WARN_ONCE() splat and an ftrace_dump().

	rcutree.sysrq_rcu= [KNL]
			Commandeer a sysrq key to dump out Tree RCU's
			rcu_node tree with an eye towards determining
			why a new grace period has not yet started.

	rcuperf.gp_async= [KNL]
			Measure performance of asynchronous
			grace-period primitives such as call_rcu().

	rcuperf.gp_async_max= [KNL]
			Specify the maximum number of outstanding
			callbacks per writer thread.  When a writer
			thread exceeds this limit, it invokes the
			corresponding flavor of rcu_barrier() to allow
			previously posted callbacks to drain.

	rcuperf.gp_exp= [KNL]
			Measure performance of expedited synchronous
			grace-period primitives.

	rcuperf.holdoff= [KNL]
			Set test-start holdoff period.  The purpose of
			this parameter is to delay the start of the
			test until boot completes in order to avoid
			interference.

	rcuperf.nreaders= [KNL]
			Set number of RCU readers.  The value -1 selects
			N, where N is the number of CPUs.  A value
			"n" less than -1 selects N-n+1, where N is again
			the number of CPUs.  For example, -2 selects N
			(the number of CPUs), -3 selects N+1, and so on.
			A value of "n" less than or equal to -N selects
			a single reader.

	rcuperf.nwriters= [KNL]
			Set number of RCU writers.  The values operate
			the same as for rcuperf.nreaders.
			N, where N is the number of CPUs

	rcuperf.perf_type= [KNL]
			Specify the RCU implementation to test.

	rcuperf.shutdown= [KNL]
			Shut the system down after performance tests
			complete.  This is useful for hands-off automated
			testing.

	rcuperf.verbose= [KNL]
			Enable additional printk() statements.

	rcuperf.writer_holdoff= [KNL]
			Write-side holdoff between grace periods,
			in microseconds.  The default of zero says
			no holdoff.

			Set duration of force_quiescent_state bursts
			in microseconds.

			Use normal (non-expedited) asynchronous
			update-side primitives, if available.

	rcutorture.gp_sync= [KNL]
			Use normal (non-expedited) synchronous
			update-side primitives, if available.  If all
			of rcutorture.gp_cond=, rcutorture.gp_exp=,
			rcutorture.gp_normal=, and rcutorture.gp_sync=
			are zero, rcutorture acts as if is interpreted
			they are all non-zero.

	rcutorture.n_barrier_cbs= [KNL]
			Set callbacks/threads for rcu_barrier() testing.

	rcutorture.nfakewriters= [KNL]
			Set number of concurrent RCU writers.  These just
			stress RCU, they don't participate in the actual
			test, hence the "fake".

	rcutorture.nreaders= [KNL]
			Set number of RCU readers.  The value -1 selects
			N-1, where N is the number of CPUs.  A value
			"n" less than -1 selects N-n-2, where N is again
			the number of CPUs.  For example, -2 selects N
			(the number of CPUs), -3 selects N+1, and so on.

	rcutorture.object_debug= [KNL]
			Enable debug-object double-call_rcu() testing.

	rcutorture.onoff_holdoff= [KNL]
			Set time (s) after boot for CPU-hotplug testing.

	rcutorture.onoff_interval= [KNL]
			Set time (jiffies) between CPU-hotplug operations,
			or zero to disable CPU-hotplug testing.

	rcutorture.shuffle_interval= [KNL]
			Set task-shuffle interval (s).  Shuffling tasks
			allows some CPUs to go into dyntick-idle mode
			during the rcutorture test.

	rcutorture.shutdown_secs= [KNL]
			Set time (s) after boot system shutdown.  This
			is useful for hands-off automated testing.

	rcutorture.stall_cpu= [KNL]
			Duration of CPU stall (s) to test RCU CPU stall
			warnings, zero to disable.

	rcutorture.stall_cpu_holdoff= [KNL]
			Time to wait (s) after boot before inducing stall.

	rcutorture.stall_cpu_irqsoff= [KNL]
			Disable interrupts while stalling if set.

	rcutorture.stat_interval= [KNL]
			Time (s) between statistics printk()s.

	rcutorture.stutter= [KNL]
			Time (s) to stutter testing, for example, specifying
			five seconds causes the test to run for five seconds,
			wait for five seconds, and so on.  This tests RCU's
			ability to transition abruptly to and from idle.

	rcutorture.test_boost= [KNL]
			Test RCU priority boosting?  0=no, 1=maybe, 2=yes.
			"Maybe" means test if the RCU implementation

	rcupdate.rcu_cpu_stall_timeout= [KNL]
			Set timeout for RCU CPU stall warning messages.

	rcupdate.rcu_expedited= [KNL]
			Use expedited grace-period primitives, for
			example, synchronize_rcu_expedited() instead
			of synchronize_rcu().  This reduces latency,
			but can increase CPU utilization, degrade
			real-time latency, and degrade energy efficiency.
			No effect on CONFIG_TINY_RCU kernels.

	rcupdate.rcu_normal= [KNL]
			Use only normal grace-period primitives,
			for example, synchronize_rcu() instead of
			synchronize_rcu_expedited().  This improves
			real-time latency, CPU utilization, and
			energy efficiency, but can expose users to
			increased grace-period latency.  This parameter
			overrides rcupdate.rcu_expedited.  No effect on
			CONFIG_TINY_RCU kernels.

	rcupdate.rcu_normal_after_boot= [KNL]
			Once boot has completed (that is, after
			rcu_end_inkernel_boot() has been invoked), use
			only normal grace-period primitives.  No effect
			on CONFIG_TINY_RCU kernels.

	rcupdate.rcu_task_stall_timeout= [KNL]

	spectre_v2=	[X86] Control mitigation of Spectre variant 2
			(indirect branch speculation) vulnerability.
			The default operation protects the kernel from
			user space attacks.

			on   - unconditionally enable, implies
			       spectre_v2_user=on
			off  - unconditionally disable, implies
			       spectre_v2_user=off
			auto - kernel detects whether your CPU model is
			       vulnerable

			Selecting 'on' will, and 'auto' may, choose a
			mitigation method at run time according to the
			CPU, the available microcode, the setting of the
			CONFIG_RETPOLINE configuration option, and the
			compiler with which the kernel was built.

			Selecting 'on' will also enable the mitigation
			against user space to user space task attacks.

			Selecting 'off' will disable both the kernel and
			the user space protections.

			Specific mitigations can also be selected manually:

			retpoline	  - replace indirect branches
			retpoline,generic - google's original retpoline
			retpoline,amd     - AMD-specific minimal thunk

			Not specifying this option is equivalent to
			spectre_v2=auto.

	spectre_v2_user=
			[X86] Control mitigation of Spectre variant 2
		        (indirect branch speculation) vulnerability between

			on	- Unconditionally enable mitigations. Is
				  enforced by spectre_v2=on

			off     - Unconditionally disable mitigations. Is
				  enforced by spectre_v2=off

			prctl   - Indirect branch speculation is enabled,
				  but mitigation can be enabled via prctl
				  per thread.  The mitigation control state
				  is inherited on fork.

			prctl,ibpb
				- Like "prctl" above, but only STIBP is
				  controlled per thread. IBPB is issued
				  always when switching between different user
				  space processes.

			seccomp
				- Same as "prctl" above, but all seccomp
				  threads will enable the mitigation unless
				  they explicitly opt out.

			seccomp,ibpb
				- Like "seccomp" above, but only STIBP is
				  controlled per thread. IBPB is issued
				  always when switching between different
				  user space processes.

			auto    - Kernel selects the mitigation depending on
				  the available CPU features and vulnerability.

			Default mitigation:
			If CONFIG_SECCOMP=y then "seccomp", otherwise "prctl"

			Not specifying this option is equivalent to
			spectre_v2_user=auto.

	spec_store_bypass_disable=
			[HW] Control Speculative Store Bypass (SSB) Disable mitigation
			(Speculative Store Bypass vulnerability)

			Certain CPUs are vulnerable to an exploit against a
			a common industry wide performance optimization known
			as "Speculative Store Bypass" in which recent stores
			to the same memory location may not be observed by
			later loads during speculative execution. The idea
			is that such stores are unlikely and that they can
			be detected prior to instruction retirement at the
			end of a particular speculation execution window.

			In vulnerable processors, the speculatively forwarded
			store can be used in a cache side channel attack, for
			example to read memory to which the attacker does not
			directly have access (e.g. inside sandboxed code).

			This parameter controls whether the Speculative Store
			Bypass optimization is used.

			On x86 the options are:

			on      - Unconditionally disable Speculative Store Bypass
			off     - Unconditionally enable Speculative Store Bypass
			auto    - Kernel detects whether the CPU model contains an
				  implementation of Speculative Store Bypass and
				  picks the most appropriate mitigation. If the
				  CPU is not vulnerable, "off" is selected. If the
				  CPU is vulnerable the default mitigation is
				  architecture and Kconfig dependent. See below.
			prctl   - Control Speculative Store Bypass per thread
				  via prctl. Speculative Store Bypass is enabled
				  for a process by default. The state of the control
				  is inherited on fork.
			seccomp - Same as "prctl" above, but all seccomp threads
				  will disable SSB unless they explicitly opt out.

			Default mitigations:
			X86:	If CONFIG_SECCOMP=y "seccomp", otherwise "prctl"

			On powerpc the options are:

			on,auto - On Power8 and Power9 insert a store-forwarding
				  barrier on kernel entry and exit. On Power7
				  perform a software flush on kernel entry and
				  exit.
			off	- No action.

			Not specifying this option is equivalent to
			spec_store_bypass_disable=auto.

	sunrpc.min_resvport=
	sunrpc.max_resvport=
			[NFS,SUNRPC]
			SunRPC servers often require that client requests
			originate from a privileged port (i.e. a port in the
			range 0 < portnr < 1024).
			An administrator who wishes to reserve some of these
			ports for other uses may adjust the range that the
			kernel's sunrpc client considers to be privileged
			using these two parameters to set the minimum and
			maximum port values.

	sunrpc.svc_rpc_per_connection_limit=

			Limit the number of requests that the server will
			process in parallel from a single connection.
			The default value is 0 (no limit).

	sunrpc.pool_mode=
			[NFS]
			Control how the NFS server code allocates CPUs to
			service thread pools.  Depending on how many NICs
			you have and where their interrupts are bound, this
			option will affect which CPUs will do NFS serving.
			Note: this parameter cannot be changed while the
			NFS server is running.

			auto	    the server chooses an appropriate mode
				    automatically using heuristics
			global	    a single global pool contains all CPUs

	sunrpc.udp_slot_table_entries=
			[NFS,SUNRPC]
			Sets the upper limit on the number of simultaneous
			RPC calls that can be sent from the client to a

			Format: integer pcr id
			Specify that at suspend time, the tpm driver
			should extend the specified pcr with zeros,

			The option-list is a comma delimited list of options
			that can be enabled or disabled just as if you were
			to echo the option name into

			    /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_options

			For example, to enable stacktrace option (to dump the
			stack trace of each event), add to the command line:

			      trace_options=stacktrace

			See also Documentation/trace/ftrace.rst "trace options"
			section.

	tp_printk[FTRACE]
			Have the tracepoints sent to printk as well as the
			tracing ring buffer. This is useful for early boot up
			where the system hangs or reboots and does not give the
			option for reading the tracing buffer or performing a
			ftrace_dump_on_oops.

			To turn off having tracepoints sent to printk,
			 echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/tracepoint_printk
			Note, echoing 1 into this file without the
			tracepoint_printk kernel cmdline option has no effect.

			** CAUTION **

			Having tracepoints sent to printk() and activating high
			frequency tracepoints such as irq or sched, can cause
			the system to live lock.

	traceoff_on_warning
			[FTRACE] enable this option to disable tracing when a
			warning is hit. This turns off "tracing_on". Tracing can
			be enabled again by echoing '1' into the "tracing_on"
			file located in /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/

			This option is useful, as it disables the trace before
			the WARNING dump is called, which prevents the trace to
			be filled with content caused by the warning output.

			This option can also be set at run time via the sysctl
			option:  kernel/traceoff_on_warning

			[x86] noirqtime: Do not use TSC to do irq accounting.
			Used to run time disable IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING on any
			platforms where RDTSC is slow and this accounting
			can add overhead.
			[x86] unstable: mark the TSC clocksource as unstable, this
			marks the TSC unconditionally unstable at bootup and
			avoids any further wobbles once the TSC watchdog notices.
			[x86] nowatchdog: disable clocksource watchdog. Used

	usbcore.nousb	[USB] Disable the USB subsystem

	usbcore.quirks=
			[USB] A list of quirk entries to augment the built-in
			usb core quirk list. List entries are separated by
			commas. Each entry has the form
			VendorID:ProductID:Flags. The IDs are 4-digit hex
			numbers and Flags is a set of letters. Each letter
			will change the built-in quirk; setting it if it is
			clear and clearing it if it is set. The letters have
			the following meanings:
				a = USB_QUIRK_STRING_FETCH_255 (string
					descriptors must not be fetched using
					a 255-byte read);
				b = USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME (device can't resume
					correctly so reset it instead);

					handle its Configuration or Interface
					strings);
				e = USB_QUIRK_RESET (device can't be reset
					(e.g morph devices), don't use reset);
				f = USB_QUIRK_HONOR_BNUMINTERFACES (device has
					more interface descriptions than the
					bNumInterfaces count, and can't handle
					talking to these interfaces);
				g = USB_QUIRK_DELAY_INIT (device needs a pause
					during initialization, after we read
					the device descriptor);
				h = USB_QUIRK_LINEAR_UFRAME_INTR_BINTERVAL (For
					high speed and super speed interrupt
					endpoints, the USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 spec
					require the interval in microframes (1
					microframe = 125 microseconds) to be
					calculated as interval = 2 ^
					(bInterval-1).
					Devices with this quirk report their
					bInterval as the result of this
					calculation instead of the exponent
					variable used in the calculation);
				i = USB_QUIRK_DEVICE_QUALIFIER (device can't
					handle device_qualifier descriptor
					requests);
				j = USB_QUIRK_IGNORE_REMOTE_WAKEUP (device
					generates spurious wakeup, ignore
					remote wakeup capability);
				k = USB_QUIRK_NO_LPM (device can't handle Link
					Power Management);
				l = USB_QUIRK_LINEAR_FRAME_INTR_BINTERVAL
					(Device reports its bInterval as linear
					frames instead of the USB 2.0
					calculation);
				m = USB_QUIRK_DISCONNECT_SUSPEND (Device needs
					to be disconnected before suspend to
					prevent spurious wakeup);
				n = USB_QUIRK_DELAY_CTRL_MSG (Device needs a
					pause after every control message);
				o = USB_QUIRK_HUB_SLOW_RESET (Hub needs extra
					delay after resetting its port);

			[UMS] The delay in seconds before a new device is
			scanned for Logical Units (default 1).

	usb-storage.quirks=
			[UMS] A list of quirks entries to supplement or
			override the built-in unusual_devs list.  List
			entries are separated by commas.  Each entry has
			the form VID:PID:Flags where VID and PID are Vendor

			Flags is a set of characters, each corresponding
			to a common usb-storage quirk flag as follows:
				a = SANE_SENSE (collect more than 18 bytes
					of sense data);
				b = BAD_SENSE (don't collect more than 18
					bytes of sense data);

					HIGHMEM regardless of setting
					of CONFIG_HIGHPTE.

	vdso=		[X86,SH]
			On X86_32, this is an alias for vdso32=.  Otherwise:

			vdso=0: disable VDSO mapping

	vdso32=		[X86] Control the 32-bit vDSO
			vdso32=1: enable 32-bit VDSO
			vdso32=0 or vdso32=2: disable 32-bit VDSO

			See the help text for CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO for more
			details.  If CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO is set, the default is
			vdso32=0; otherwise, the default is vdso32=1.

			For compatibility with older kernels, vdso32=2 is an
			alias for vdso32=0.

			Try vdso32=0 if you encounter an error that says:
			dl_main: Assertion `(void *) ph->p_vaddr == _rtld_local._dl_sysinfo_dso' failed!

	vector=		[IA-64,SMP]
			vector=percpu: enable percpu vector domain

	video=		[FB] Frame buffer configuration
			See Documentation/fb/modedb.txt.

	video.brightness_switch_enabled= [0,1]
			If set to 1, on receiving an ACPI notify event
			generated by hotkey, video driver will adjust brightness
			level and then send out the event to user space through
			the allocated input device; If set to 0, video driver
			will only send out the event without touching backlight
			brightness level.
			default: 1

	virtio_mmio.device=
			[VMMIO] Memory mapped virtio (platform) device.

				<size>@<baseaddr>:<irq>[:<id>]
			where:

						request_irq())
				<id>       := (optional) platform device id
			example:
				virtio_mmio.device=1K@0x100b0000:48:7

			Can be used multiple times for multiple devices.

	vga=		[BOOT,X86-32] Select a particular video mode
			See Documentation/x86/boot.txt and
			Documentation/svga.txt.
			Use vga=ask for menu.
			This is actually a boot loader parameter; the value is
			passed to the kernel using a special protocol.

	vm_debug[=options]	[KNL] Available with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM=y.
			May slow down system boot speed, especially when
			enabled on systems with a large amount of memory.
			All options are enabled by default, and this
			interface is meant to allow for selectively
			enabling or disabling specific virtual memory
			debugging features.

			Available options are:
			  P	Enable page structure init time poisoning
			  -	Disable all of the above options

	vmalloc=nn[KMG]	[KNL,BOOT] Forces the vmalloc area to have an exact
			size of <nn>. This can be used to increase the
			minimum size (128MB on x86). It can also be used to
			decrease the size and leave more room for directly
			mapped kernel RAM.

	vmcp_cma=nn[MG]	[KNL,S390]
			Sets the memory size reserved for contiguous memory
			allocations for the vmcp device driver.

	vmhalt=		[KNL,S390] Perform z/VM CP command after system halt.

			Format: <command>

	vmpoff=		[KNL,S390] Perform z/VM CP command after power off.
			Format: <command>

	vsyscall=	[X86-64]
			Controls the behavior of vsyscalls (i.e. calls to
			fixed addresses of 0xffffffffff600x00 from legacy
			code).  Most statically-linked binaries and older
			versions of glibc use these calls.  Because these
			functions are at fixed addresses, they make nice
			targets for exploits that can control RIP.

			emulate     [default] Vsyscalls turn into traps and are
			            emulated reasonably safely.  The vsyscall
				    page is readable.

			xonly       Vsyscalls turn into traps and are
			            emulated reasonably safely.  The vsyscall
				    page is not readable.

			none        Vsyscalls don't work at all.  This makes
			            them quite hard to use for exploits but
			            might break your system.

	vt.color=	[VT] Default text color.
			Format: 0xYX, X = foreground, Y = background.
			Default: 0x07 = light gray on black.

	vt.cur_default=	[VT] Default cursor shape.
			Format: 0xCCBBAA, where AA, BB, and CC are the same as
			the parameters of the <Esc>[?A;B;Cc escape sequence;
			see VGA-softcursor.txt. Default: 2 = underline.

	vt.default_blu=	[VT]
			Format: <blue0>,<blue1>,<blue2>,...,<blue15>
			Change the default blue palette of the console.
			This is a 16-member array composed of values
			ranging from 0-255.

	vt.default_grn=	[VT]
			Format: <green0>,<green1>,<green2>,...,<green15>
			Change the default green palette of the console.
			This is a 16-member array composed of values
			ranging from 0-255.

	vt.default_red=	[VT]
			Format: <red0>,<red1>,<red2>,...,<red15>
			Change the default red palette of the console.
			This is a 16-member array composed of values
			ranging from 0-255.

	vt.default_utf8=
			[VT]
			Format=<0|1>
			Set system-wide default UTF-8 mode for all tty's.
			Default is 1, i.e. UTF-8 mode is enabled for all
			newly opened terminals.

	vt.global_cursor_default=
			[VT]
			Format=<-1|0|1>
			Set system-wide default for whether a cursor
			is shown on new VTs. Default is -1,
			i.e. cursors will be created by default unless
			overridden by individual drivers. 0 will hide
			cursors, 1 will display them.

	watchdog timers	[HW,WDT] For information on watchdog timers,
			see Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-parameters.txt
			or other driver-specific files in the
			Documentation/watchdog/ directory.

	watchdog_thresh=
			[KNL]
			Set the hard lockup detector stall duration
			threshold in seconds. The soft lockup detector
			threshold is set to twice the value. A value of 0
			disables both lockup detectors. Default is 10
			seconds.

	workqueue.watchdog_thresh=
			If CONFIG_WQ_WATCHDOG is configured, workqueue can
			warn stall conditions and dump internal state to
			help debugging.  0 disables workqueue stall
			detection; otherwise, it's the stall threshold
			duration in seconds.  The default value is 30 and
			it can be updated at runtime by writing to the
			corresponding sysfs file.

	workqueue.disable_numa
			By default, all work items queued to unbound
			workqueues are affine to the NUMA nodes they're
			issued on, which results in better behavior in
			general.  If NUMA affinity needs to be disabled for
			whatever reason, this option can be used.  Note
			that this also can be controlled per-workqueue for
			workqueues visible under /sys/bus/workqueue/.

	workqueue.power_efficient
			Per-cpu workqueues are generally preferred because
			they show better performance thanks to cache
			locality; unfortunately, per-cpu workqueues tend to
			be more power hungry than unbound workqueues.

			Enabling this makes the per-cpu workqueues which
			were observed to contribute significantly to power
			consumption unbound, leading to measurably lower
			power usage at the cost of small performance
			overhead.

			The default value of this parameter is determined by
			the config option CONFIG_WQ_POWER_EFFICIENT_DEFAULT.

	workqueue.debug_force_rr_cpu
			Workqueue used to implicitly guarantee that work
			items queued without explicit CPU specified are put
			on the local CPU.  This guarantee is no longer true
			and while local CPU is still preferred work items
			may be put on foreign CPUs.  This debug option
			forces round-robin CPU selection to flush out
			usages which depend on the now broken guarantee.
			When enabled, memory and cache locality will be
			impacted.

	x2apic_phys	[X86-64,APIC] Use x2apic physical mode instead of
			default x2apic cluster mode on platforms
			supporting x2apic.

	x86_intel_mid_timer= [X86-32,APBT]
			Choose timer option for x86 Intel MID platform.
			Two valid options are apbt timer only and lapic timer
			plus one apbt timer for broadcast timer.
			x86_intel_mid_timer=apbt_only | lapic_and_apbt

	xen_512gb_limit		[KNL,X86-64,XEN]
			Restricts the kernel running paravirtualized under Xen
			to use only up to 512 GB of RAM. The reason to do so is
			crash analysis tools and Xen tools for doing domain
			save/restore/migration must be enabled to handle larger
			domains.

	xen_emul_unplug=		[HW,X86,XEN]
			Unplug Xen emulated devices
			Format: [unplug0,][unplug1]
			ide-disks -- unplug primary master IDE devices
			aux-ide-disks -- unplug non-primary-master IDE devices
			nics -- unplug network devices
			all -- unplug all emulated devices (NICs and IDE disks)
			unnecessary -- unplugging emulated devices is
				unnecessary even if the host did not respond to
				the unplug protocol
			never -- do not unplug even if version check succeeds

	xen_nopvspin	[X86,XEN]
			Disables the ticketlock slowpath using Xen PV
			optimizations.

	xen_nopv	[X86]
			Disables the PV optimizations forcing the HVM guest to
			run as generic HVM guest with no PV drivers.

	xen_scrub_pages=	[XEN]
			Boolean option to control scrubbing pages before giving them back
			to Xen, for use by other domains. Can be also changed at runtime
			with /sys/devices/system/xen_memory/xen_memory0/scrub_pages.
			Default value controlled with CONFIG_XEN_SCRUB_PAGES_DEFAULT.

	xen_timer_slop=	[X86-64,XEN]
			Set the timer slop (in nanoseconds) for the virtual Xen
			timers (default is 100000). This adjusts the minimum
			delta of virtualized Xen timers, where lower values
			improve timer resolution at the expense of processing
			more timer interrupts.

	xirc2ps_cs=	[NET,PCMCIA]
			Format:
			<irq>,<irq_mask>,<io>,<full_duplex>,<do_sound>,<lockup_hack>[,<irq2>[,<irq3>[,<irq4>]]]

	xhci-hcd.quirks		[USB,KNL]
			A hex value specifying bitmask with supplemental xhci
			host controller quirks. Meaning of each bit can be
			consulted in header drivers/usb/host/xhci.h.
