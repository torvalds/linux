		Advanced Linux Sound Architecture - Driver
		==========================================
			    Configuration guide


Kernel Configuration
====================

To enable ALSA support you need at least to build the kernel with
primary sound card support (CONFIG_SOUND).  Since ALSA can emulate OSS,
you don't have to choose any of the OSS modules.

Enable "OSS API emulation" (CONFIG_SND_OSSEMUL) and both OSS mixer and
PCM supports if you want to run OSS applications with ALSA.

If you want to support the WaveTable functionality on cards such as
SB Live! then you need to enable "Sequencer support"
(CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER).

To make ALSA debug messages more verbose, enable the "Verbose printk"
and "Debug" options.  To check for memory leaks, turn on "Debug memory"
too.  "Debug detection" will add checks for the detection of cards.

Please note that all the ALSA ISA drivers support the Linux isapnp API
(if the card supports ISA PnP).  You don't need to configure the cards
using isapnptools.


Creating ALSA devices
=====================

This depends on your distribution, but normally you use the /dev/MAKEDEV
script to create the necessary device nodes.  On some systems you use a
script named 'snddevices'.


Module parameters
=================

The user can load modules with options. If the module supports more than
one card and you have more than one card of the same type then you can
specify multiple values for the option separated by commas.

Prior to version 0.9.0rc4 options had a 'snd_' prefix. This was removed.

  Module snd
  ----------

    The core ALSA module.  It is used by all ALSA card drivers.
    It takes the following options which have global effects.

    major	- major number for sound driver
		- Default: 116
    cards_limit
		- limiting card index for auto-loading (1-8)
		- Default: 1
		- For auto-loading more than one card, specify this
		  option together with snd-card-X aliases.
    device_mode
		- permission mask for dynamic sound device filesystem
		- This is available only when DEVFS is enabled
		- Default: 0666
		- E.g.: device_mode=0660

  
  Module snd-pcm-oss
  ------------------

    The PCM OSS emulation module.
    This module takes options which change the mapping of devices.

    dsp_map	- PCM device number maps assigned to the 1st OSS device.
		- Default: 0
    adsp_map	- PCM device number maps assigned to the 2st OSS device.
		- Default: 1
    nonblock_open
		- Don't block opening busy PCM devices.  Default: 1

    For example, when dsp_map=2, /dev/dsp will be mapped to PCM #2 of
    the card #0.  Similarly, when adsp_map=0, /dev/adsp will be mapped
    to PCM #0 of the card #0.
    For changing the second or later card, specify the option with
    commas, such like "dsp_map=0,1".

    nonblock_open option is used to change the behavior of the PCM
    regarding opening the device.  When this option is non-zero,
    opening a busy OSS PCM device won't be blocked but return
    immediately with EAGAIN (just like O_NONBLOCK flag).
    
  Module snd-rawmidi
  ------------------

    This module takes options which change the mapping of devices.
    similar to those of the snd-pcm-oss module.

    midi_map	- MIDI device number maps assigned to the 1st OSS device.
		- Default: 0
    amidi_map	- MIDI device number maps assigned to the 2st OSS device.
		- Default: 1

  Common parameters for top sound card modules
  --------------------------------------------

    Each of top level sound card module takes the following options.

    index	- index (slot #) of sound card
		- Values: 0 through 31 or negative
		- If nonnegative, assign that index number
                - if negative, interpret as a bitmask of permissible
		  indices; the first free permitted index is assigned
		- Default: -1
    id		- card ID (identifier or name)
		- Can be up to 15 characters long
		- Default: the card type
		- A directory by this name is created under /proc/asound/
		  containing information about the card
		- This ID can be used instead of the index number in
		  identifying the card
    enable  	- enable card
		- Default: enabled, for PCI and ISA PnP cards

  Module snd-adlib
  ----------------

    Module for AdLib FM cards.

    port	- port # for OPL chip

    This module supports multiple cards. It does not support autoprobe, so
    the port must be specified. For actual AdLib FM cards it will be 0x388.
    Note that this card does not have PCM support and no mixer; only FM
    synthesis.

    Make sure you have "sbiload" from the alsa-tools package available and,
    after loading the module, find out the assigned ALSA sequencer port
    number through "sbiload -l". Example output:

      Port     Client name                       Port name
      64:0     OPL2 FM synth                     OPL2 FM Port

    Load the std.sb and drums.sb patches also supplied by sbiload:

      sbiload -p 64:0 std.sb drums.sb

    If you use this driver to drive an OPL3, you can use std.o3 and drums.o3
    instead. To have the card produce sound, use aplaymidi from alsa-utils:

      aplaymidi -p 64:0 foo.mid

    If the default configuration doesn't work and one of the above
    matches with your device, report it together with the PCI
    subsystem ID (output of "lspci -nv") to ALSA BTS or alsa-devel
    ML (see the section "Links and Addresses").

    Note 2: If you get click noises on output, try the module option
	    position_fix=1 or 2.  position_fix=1 will use the SD_LPIB
	    register value without FIFO size correction as the current
	    DMA pointer.  position_fix=2 will make the driver to use
	    the position buffer instead of reading SD_LPIB register.
	    (Usually SD_LPLIB register is more accurate than the
	    position buffer.)

    NB: If you get many "azx_get_response timeout" messages at
    loading, it's likely a problem of interrupts (e.g. ACPI irq
    routing).  Try to boot with options like "pci=noacpi".  Also, you
    can try "single_cmd=1" module option.  This will switch the
    communication method between HDA controller and codecs to the
    single immediate commands instead of CORB/RIRB.  Basically, the
    single command mode is provided only for BIOS, and you won't get
    unsolicited events, too.  But, at least, this works independently
    from the irq.  Remember this is a last resort, and should be
    avoided as much as possible...
    
    The power-management is supported.

  Module snd-hdsp
  ---------------

    Module for RME Hammerfall DSP audio interface(s)

    This module supports multiple cards.

    Note: The firmware data can be automatically loaded via hotplug
          when CONFIG_FW_LOADER is set.  Otherwise, you need to load
          the firmware via hdsploader utility included in alsa-tools
          package.
          The firmware data is found in alsa-firmware package.

    Note: snd-page-alloc module does the job which snd-hammerfall-mem
          module did formerly.  It will allocate the buffers in advance
          when any HDSP cards are found.  To make the buffer
          allocation sure, load snd-page-alloc module in the early
          stage of boot sequence.  See "Early Buffer Allocation"
	  section.

  Module snd-nm256
  ----------------

    Module for NeoMagic NM256AV/ZX chips

    playback_bufsize - max playback frame size in kB (4-128kB)
    capture_bufsize  - max capture frame size in kB (4-128kB)
    force_ac97       - 0 or 1 (disabled by default)
    buffer_top       - specify buffer top address
    use_cache        - 0 or 1 (disabled by default)
    vaio_hack        - alias buffer_top=0x25a800
    reset_workaround - enable AC97 RESET workaround for some laptops
    reset_workaround2 - enable extended AC97 RESET workaround for some
		      other laptops

    This module supports one chip and autoprobe.

    The power-management is supported.

    Note: on some notebooks the buffer address cannot be detected
    automatically, or causes hang-up during initialization.
    In such a case, specify the buffer top address explicity via
    buffer_top option.
    For example,
      Sony F250: buffer_top=0x25a800
      Sony F270: buffer_top=0x272800
    The driver supports only ac97 codec.  It's possible to force
    to initialize/use ac97 although it's not detected.  In such a
    case, use force_ac97=1 option - but *NO* guarantee whether it
    works!

    Note: The NM256 chip can be linked internally with non-AC97
    codecs.  This driver supports only the AC97 codec, and won't work
    with machines with other (most likely CS423x or OPL3SAx) chips,
    even though the device is detected in lspci.  In such a case, try
    other drivers, e.g. snd-cs4232 or snd-opl3sa2.  Some has ISA-PnP
    but some doesn't have ISA PnP.  You'll need to specify isapnp=0
    and proper hardware parameters in the case without ISA PnP.

    Note: some laptops need a workaround for AC97 RESET.  For the
    known hardware like Dell Latitude LS and Sony PCG-F305, this
    workaround is enabled automatically.  For other laptops with a
    hard freeze, you can try reset_workaround=1 option.

    Note: Dell Latitude CSx laptops have another problem regarding
    AC97 RESET.  On these laptops, reset_workaround2 option is
    turned on as default.  This option is worth to try if the
    previous reset_workaround option doesn't help.

    Note: This driver is really crappy.  It's a porting from the
    OSS driver, which is a result of black-magic reverse engineering.
    The detection of codec will fail if the driver is loaded *after*
    X-server as described above.  You might be able to force to load
    the module, but it may result in hang-up.   Hence, make sure that
    you load this module *before* X if you encounter this kind of
    problem.

  Module snd-opl3sa2
  ------------------

    Module for Yamaha OPL3-SA2/SA3 sound cards.

    ac97_quirk  - AC'97 workaround for strange hardware
		  See "AC97 Quirk Option" section below.

    This module supports one chip and autoprobe.

    Note: on some SMP motherboards like MSI 694D the interrupts might
          not be generated properly.  In such a case, please try to
          set the SMP (or MPS) version on BIOS to 1.1 instead of
          default value 1.4.  Then the interrupt number will be
          assigned under 15. You might also upgrade your BIOS.
    
    Note: VIA8233/5/7 (not VIA8233A) can support DXS (direct sound)
	  channels as the first PCM.  On these channels, up to 4
	  streams can be played at the same time, and the controller
	  can perform sample rate conversion with separate rates for
	  each channel.
	  As default (dxs_support = 0), 48k fixed rate is chosen
	  except for the known devices since the output is often
	  noisy except for 48k on some mother boards due to the
	  bug of BIOS.
	  Please try once dxs_support=5 and if it works on other
	  sample rates (e.g. 44.1kHz of mp3 playback), please let us
	  know the PCI subsystem vendor/device id's (output of
	  "lspci -nv").
	  If dxs_support=5 does not work, try dxs_support=4; if it
	  doesn't work too, try dxs_support=1.  (dxs_support=1 is
	  usually for old motherboards.  The correct implemented
	  board should work with 4 or 5.)  If it still doesn't
	  work and the default setting is ok, dxs_support=3 is the
	  right choice.  If the default setting doesn't work at all,
	  try dxs_support=2 to disable the DXS channels.
	  In any cases, please let us know the result and the
	  subsystem vendor/device ids.  See "Links and Addresses"
	  below.

    Note: for the MPU401 on VIA823x, use snd-mpu401 driver
	  additionally.  The mpu_port option is for VIA686 chips only.

    The power-management is supported.

  Module snd-via82xx-modem

          slot is excluded.

    The power-management is supported.

  Module snd-virmidi
  ------------------

    Module for virtual rawmidi devices.
    This module creates virtual rawmidi devices which communicate
    to the corresponding ALSA sequencer ports.

  Module snd-vx222
  ----------------

    Module for Digigram VX-Pocket VX222, V222 v2 and Mic cards.

    mic		- Enable Microphone on V222 Mic (NYI)
    ibl		- Capture IBL size. (default = 0, minimum size)

    This module supports multiple cards.

    When the driver is compiled as a module and the hotplug firmware
    is supported, the firmware data is loaded via hotplug automatically.
    Install the necessary firmware files in alsa-firmware package.
    When no hotplug fw loader is available, you need to load the
    firmware via vxloader utility in alsa-tools package.  To invoke
    vxloader automatically, add the following to /etc/modprobe.conf

	install snd-vx222 /sbin/modprobe --first-time -i snd-vx222 && /usr/bin/vxloader

    (for 2.2/2.4 kernels, add "post-install /usr/bin/vxloader" to
     /etc/modules.conf, instead.)
    IBL size defines the interrupts period for PCM.  The smaller size
    gives smaller latency but leads to more CPU consumption, too.
    The size is usually aligned to 126.  As default (=0), the smallest
    size is chosen.  The possible IBL values can be found in
    /proc/asound/cardX/vx-status proc file.

    The power-management is supported.

  Module snd-vxpocket
  -------------------

    Module for Digigram VX-Pocket VX2 and 440 PCMCIA cards.

    ibl      - Capture IBL size. (default = 0, minimum size)

    This module supports multiple cards.  The module is compiled only when
    PCMCIA is supported on kernel.

    With the older 2.6.x kernel, to activate the driver via the card
    manager, you'll need to set up /etc/pcmcia/vxpocket.conf.  See the
    sound/pcmcia/vx/vxpocket.c.  2.6.13 or later kernel requires no
    longer require a config file.

    When the driver is compiled as a module and the hotplug firmware
    is supported, the firmware data is loaded via hotplug automatically.
    Install the necessary firmware files in alsa-firmware package.
    When no hotplug fw loader is available, you need to load the
    firmware via vxloader utility in alsa-tools package.

    About capture IBL, see the description of snd-vx222 module.

    Note: the driver is build only when CONFIG_ISA is set.
    
    Note2: snd-vxp440 driver is merged to snd-vxpocket driver since
           ALSA 1.0.10.

    The power-management is supported.

    Note: the driver is build only when CONFIG_ISA is set.

    The power-management is supported.


AC97 Quirk Option
=================

The ac97_quirk option is used to enable/override the workaround for
specific devices on drivers for on-board AC'97 controllers like
snd-intel8x0.  Some hardware have swapped output pins between Master
and Headphone, or Surround (thanks to confusion of AC'97
specifications from version to version :-)

The driver provides the auto-detection of known problematic devices,
but some might be unknown or wrongly detected.  In such a case, pass
the proper value with this option.

The following strings are accepted:
    - default	Don't override the default setting
    - none	Disable the quirk
    - hp_only	Bind Master and Headphone controls as a single control
    - swap_hp	Swap headphone and master controls
    - swap_surround  Swap master and surround controls
    - ad_sharing  For AD1985, turn on OMS bit and use headphone
    - alc_jack	For ALC65x, turn on the jack sense mode
    - inv_eapd	Inverted EAPD implementation
    - mute_led	Bind EAPD bit for turning on/off mute LED

For backward compatibility, the corresponding integer value -1, 0,
... are  accepted, too.

For example, if "Master" volume control has no effect on your device
but only "Headphone" does, pass ac97_quirk=hp_only module option.


Configuring Non-ISAPNP Cards
============================

When the kernel is configured with ISA-PnP support, the modules
supporting the isapnp cards will have module options "isapnp".
If this option is set, *only* the ISA-PnP devices will be probed.
For probing the non ISA-PnP cards, you have to pass "isapnp=0" option
together with the proper i/o and irq configuration.

When the kernel is configured without ISA-PnP support, isapnp option
will be not built in.


Module Autoloading Support
==========================

The ALSA drivers can be loaded automatically on demand by defining
module aliases.  The string 'snd-card-%1' is requested for ALSA native
devices where %i is sound card number from zero to seven.

To auto-load an ALSA driver for OSS services, define the string
'sound-slot-%i' where %i means the slot number for OSS, which
corresponds to the card index of ALSA.  Usually, define this
as the same card module.

An example configuration for a single emu10k1 card is like below:
----- /etc/modprobe.conf
alias snd-card-0 snd-emu10k1
alias sound-slot-0 snd-emu10k1
----- /etc/modprobe.conf

The available number of auto-loaded sound cards depends on the module
option "cards_limit" of snd module.  As default it's set to 1.
To enable the auto-loading of multiple cards, specify the number of
sound cards in that option.

When multiple cards are available, it'd better to specify the index
number for each card via module option, too, so that the order of
cards is kept consistent.

An example configuration for two sound cards is like below:

----- /etc/modprobe.conf
# ALSA portion
options snd cards_limit=2
alias snd-card-0 snd-interwave
alias snd-card-1 snd-ens1371
options snd-interwave index=0
options snd-ens1371 index=1
# OSS/Free portion
alias sound-slot-0 snd-interwave
alias sound-slot-1 snd-ens1371
----- /etc/moprobe.conf

In this example, the interwave card is always loaded as the first card
(index 0) and ens1371 as the second (index 1).


ALSA PCM devices to OSS devices mapping
=======================================

/dev/snd/pcmC0D0[c|p]  -> /dev/audio0 (/dev/audio) -> minor 4
/dev/snd/pcmC0D0[c|p]  -> /dev/dsp0 (/dev/dsp)     -> minor 3

/dev/snd/pcmC1D0[c|p]  -> /dev/dsp1                -> minor 3+16 = 19
/dev/snd/pcmC1D1[c|p]  -> /dev/adsp1               -> minor 12+16 = 28
/dev/snd/pcmC2D0[c|p]  -> /dev/audio2              -> minor 4+32 = 36
/dev/snd/pcmC2D0[c|p]  -> /dev/dsp2                -> minor 3+32 = 39
/dev/snd/pcmC2D1[c|p]  -> /dev/adsp2               -> minor 12+32 = 44

The first number from /dev/snd/pcmC{X}D{Y}[c|p] expression means
sound card number and second means device number.  The ALSA devices
have either 'c' or 'p' suffix indicating the direction, capture and
playback, respectively.

Please note that the device mapping above may be varied via the module
options of snd-pcm-oss module.


DEVFS support
=============

The ALSA driver fully supports the devfs extension.
You should add lines below to your devfsd.conf file:

LOOKUP snd MODLOAD ACTION snd
REGISTER ^sound/.* PERMISSIONS root.audio 660
REGISTER ^snd/.* PERMISSIONS root.audio 660

Warning: These lines assume that you have the audio group in your system.
         Otherwise replace audio word with another group name (root for
         example).


Proc interfaces (/proc/asound)
==============================

/proc/asound/card#/pcm#[cp]/oss
-------------------------------
  String "erase" - erase all additional informations about OSS applications
  String "<app_name> <fragments> <fragment_size> [<options>]"

   <app_name> - name of application with (higher priority) or without path
   <fragments> - number of fragments or zero if auto
   <fragment_size> - size of fragment in bytes or zero if auto
   <options> - optional parameters
	  - disable   the application tries to open a pcm device for
		      this channel but does not want to use it.
		      (Cause a bug or mmap needs)
		      It's good for Quake etc...
	  - direct    don't use plugins
	  - block     force block mode (rvplayer)
	  - non-block force non-block mode
	  - whole-frag  write only whole fragments (optimization affecting
			playback only)
	  - no-silence  do not fill silence ahead to avoid clicks
	  - buggy-ptr	Returns the whitespace blocks in GETOPTR ioctl
			instead of filled blocks

  Example: echo "x11amp 128 16384" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss
           echo "squake 0 0 disable" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0c/oss
	   echo "rvplayer 0 0 block" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss


Early Buffer Allocation
=======================

Some drivers (e.g. hdsp) require the large contiguous buffers, and
sometimes it's too late to find such spaces when the driver module is
actually loaded due to memory fragmentation.  You can pre-allocate the
PCM buffers by loading snd-page-alloc module and write commands to its
proc file in prior, for example, in the early boot stage like
/etc/init.d/*.local scripts.

Reading the proc file /proc/drivers/snd-page-alloc shows the current
usage of page allocation.  In writing, you can send the following
commands to the snd-page-alloc driver:

  - add VENDOR DEVICE MASK SIZE BUFFERS

    VENDOR and DEVICE are PCI vendor and device IDs.  They take
    integer numbers (0x prefix is needed for the hex).
    MASK is the PCI DMA mask.  Pass 0 if not restricted.
    SIZE is the size of each buffer to allocate.  You can pass
    k and m suffix for KB and MB.  The max number is 16MB.
    BUFFERS is the number of buffers to allocate.  It must be greater
    than 0.  The max number is 4.

  - erase

    This will erase the all pre-allocated buffers which are not in
    use.
