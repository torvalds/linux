Documentation for the AD1816(A) sound driver
============================================

Installation:
-------------

To get your AD1816(A) based sound card work, you'll have to enable support for
experimental code ("Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers")
and isapnp ("Plug and Play support", "ISA Plug and Play support"). Enable
"Sound card support", "OSS modules support" and "Support for AD1816(A) based
cards (EXPERIMENTAL)" in the sound configuration menu, too. Now build, install
and reboot the new kernel as usual.

Features:
---------

List of features supported by this driver:
- full-duplex support
- supported audio formats: unsigned 8bit, signed 16bit little endian, 
                           signed 16bit big endian, µ-law, A-law
- supported channels: mono and stereo
- supported recording sources: Master, CD, Line, Line1, Line2, Mic
- supports phat 3d stereo circuit (Line 3)


Supported cards:
----------------

The following cards are known to work with this driver:
- Terratec Base 1 
- Terratec Base 64 
- HP Kayak 
- Acer FX-3D
- SY-1816 
- Highscreen Sound-Boostar 32 Wave 3D
- Highscreen Sound-Boostar 16 
- AVM Apex Pro card 
- (Aztech SC-16 3D) 
- (Newcom SC-16 3D) 
- (Terratec EWS64S) 

Cards listed in brackets are not supported reliable. If you have such a card 
you should add the extra parameter:
  options=1
when loading the ad1816 module via modprobe. 


Troubleshooting:
----------------

First of all you should check, if the driver has been loaded
properly.

If loading of the driver succeeds, but playback/capture fails, check
if you used the correct values for irq, dma and dma2 when loading the module.
If one of them is wrong you usually get the following error message:

Nov  6 17:06:13 tek01 kernel: Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?

If playback/capture is too fast or to slow, you should have a look at
the clock chip of your sound card. The AD1816 was designed for a 33MHz
oscillator, however most sound card manufacturer use slightly
different oscillators as they are cheaper than 33MHz oscillators. If
you have such a card you have to adjust the ad1816_clockfreq parameter
above. For example: For a card using a 32.875MHz oscillator use
ad1816_clockfreq=32875 instead of ad1816_clockfreq=33000.


Updates, bugfixes and bugreports:
--------------------------------

As the driver is still experimental and under development, you should
watch out for updates.  Updates of the driver are available on the
Internet from one of my home pages:
