To configure the Crystal CS423x sound chip and activate its DSP functions,
modules may be loaded in this order:
  
	modprobe sound
	insmod ad1848
	insmod uart401
	insmod cs4232 io=* irq=* dma=* dma2=*
  
This is the meaning of the parameters:
  
	io--I/O address of the Windows Sound System (normally 0x534)
	irq--IRQ of this device
	dma and dma2--DMA channels (DMA2 may be 0)
  
On some cards, the board attempts to do non-PnP setup, and fails.  If you
have problems, use Linux' PnP facilities. 
  
To get MIDI facilities add
  
	insmod opl3 io=*
  
where "io" is the I/O address of the OPL3 synthesizer. This will be shown
in /proc/sys/pnp and is normally 0x388.
