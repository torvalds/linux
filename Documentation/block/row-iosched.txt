Introduction
============

The ROW scheduling algorithm will be used in mobile devices as default
block layer IO scheduling algorithm. ROW stands for "READ Over WRITE"
which is the main requests dispatch policy of this algorithm.

The ROW IO scheduler was developed with the mobile devices needs in
mind. In mobile devices we favor user experience upon everything else,
thus we want to give READ IO requests as much priority as possible.
The main idea of the ROW scheduling policy is just that:
- If there are READ requests in pipe - dispatch them, while write
starvation is considered.

Software description
====================
The elevator defines a registering mechanism for different IO scheduler
to implement. This makes implementing a new algorithm quite straight
forward and requires almost no changes to block/elevator framework. A
new IO scheduler just has to implement a set of callback functions
defined by the elevator.
These callbacks cover all the required IO operations such as
adding/removing request to/from the scheduler, merging two requests,
dispatching a request etc.

Design
======

The requests are kept in queues according to their priority. The
dispatching of requests is done in a Round Robin manner with a
different slice for each queue. The dispatch quantum for a specific
queue is set according to the queues priority. READ queues are
given bigger dispatch quantum than the WRITE queues, within a dispatch
cycle.

At the moment there are 6 types of queues the requests are
distributed to:
-	High priority READ queue
-	High priority Synchronous WRITE queue
-	Regular priority READ queue
-	Regular priority Synchronous WRITE queue
-	Regular priority WRITE queue
-	Low priority READ queue

The marking of request as high/low priority will be done by the
application adding the request and not the scheduler. See TODO section.
If the request is not marked in any way (high/low) the scheduler
assigns it to one of the regular priority queues:
read/write/sync write.

If in a certain dispatch cycle one of the queues was empty and didn't
use its quantum that queue will be marked as "un-served". If we're in
a middle of a dispatch cycle dispatching from queue Y and a request
arrives for queue X that was un-served in the previous cycle, if X's
priority is higher than Y's, queue X will be preempted in the favor of
queue Y.

For READ request queues ROW IO scheduler allows idling within a
dispatch quantum in order to give the application a chance to insert
more requests. Idling means adding some extra time for serving a
certain queue even if the queue is empty. The idling is enabled if
the ROW IO scheduler identifies the application is inserting requests
in a high frequency.
Not all queues can idle. ROW scheduler exposes an enablement struct
for idling.
For idling on READ queues, the ROW IO scheduler uses timer mechanism.
When the timer expires we schedule a delayed work that will signal the
device driver to fetch another request for dispatch.

ROW scheduler will support additional services for block devices that
supports Urgent Requests. That is, the scheduler may inform the
device driver upon urgent requests using a newly defined callback.
In addition it will support rescheduling of requests that were
interrupted. For example if the device driver issues a long write
request and a sudden urgent request is received by the scheduler.
The scheduler will inform the device driver about the urgent request,
so the device driver can stop the current write request and serve the
urgent request. In such a case the device driver may also insert back
to the scheduler the remainder of the interrupted write request, such
that the scheduler may continue sending urgent requests without the
need to interrupt the ongoing write again and again. The write
remainder will be sent later on according to the scheduler policy.

SMP/multi-core
==============
At the moment the code is accessed from 2 contexts:
- Application context (from block/elevator layer): adding the requests.
- device driver thread: dispatching the requests and notifying on
  completion.

One lock is used to synchronize between the two. This lock is provided
by the block device driver along with the dispatch queue.

Config options
==============
1. hp_read_quantum: dispatch quantum for the high priority READ queue
   (default is 100 requests)
2. rp_read_quantum: dispatch quantum for the regular priority READ
   queue (default is 100 requests)
3. hp_swrite_quantum: dispatch quantum for the high priority
   Synchronous WRITE queue (default is 2 requests)
4. rp_swrite_quantum: dispatch quantum for the regular priority
   Synchronous WRITE queue (default is 1 requests)
5. rp_write_quantum: dispatch quantum for the regular priority WRITE
   queue (default is 1 requests)
6. lp_read_quantum: dispatch quantum for the low priority READ queue
   (default is 1 requests)
7. lp_swrite_quantum: dispatch quantum for the low priority Synchronous
   WRITE queue (default is 1 requests)
8. read_idle: how long to idle on read queue in Msec (in case idling
   is enabled on that queue). (default is 5 Msec)
9. read_idle_freq: frequency of inserting READ requests that will
   trigger idling. This is the time in Msec between inserting two READ
   requests. (default is 8 Msec)

Note: Dispatch quantum is number of requests that will be dispatched
from a certain queue in a dispatch cycle.

To do
=====
The ROW algorithm takes the scheduling policy one step further, making
it a bit more "user-needs oriented", by allowing the application to
hint on the urgency of its requests. For example: even among the READ
requests several requests may be more urgent for completion than other.
The former will go to the High priority READ queue, that is given the
bigger dispatch quantum than any other queue.

Still need to design the way applications will "hint" on the urgency of
their requests. May be done by ioctl(). We need to look into concrete
use-cases in order to determine the best solution for this.
This will be implemented as a second phase.

Design and implement additional services for block devices that
supports High Priority Requests.
