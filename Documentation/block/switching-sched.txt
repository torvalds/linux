As of the Linux 2.6.10 kernel, it is now possible to change the
IO scheduler for a given block device on the fly (thus making it possible,
for instance, to set the CFQ scheduler for the system default, but
set a specific device to use the anticipatory or noop schedulers - which
can improve that device's throughput).

To set a specific scheduler, simply do this:

echo SCHEDNAME > /sys/block/DEV/queue/scheduler

where SCHEDNAME is the name of a defined IO scheduler, and DEV is the
device name (hda, hdb, sga, or whatever you happen to have).

The list of defined schedulers can be found by simply doing
a "cat /sys/block/DEV/queue/scheduler" - the list of valid names
will be displayed, with the currently selected scheduler in brackets:

# cat /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler
noop anticipatory deadline [cfq]
# echo anticipatory > /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler
# cat /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler
noop [anticipatory] deadline cfq
