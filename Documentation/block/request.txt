Short explanation of request members

Classification flags:

	D	driver member
	B	block layer member
	I	I/O scheduler member

Unless an entry contains a D classification, a device driver must not access
this member. Some members may contain D classifications, but should only be
access through certain macros or functions (eg ->flags).
