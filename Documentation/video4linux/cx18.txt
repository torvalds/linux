Some notes regarding the cx18 driver for the Conexant CX23418 MPEG
encoder chip:

1) The only hardware currently supported is the Hauppauge HVR-1600.

2) Some people have problems getting the i2c bus to work. Cause unknown.
   The symptom is that the eeprom cannot be read and the card is
   unusable.

3) The audio from the analog tuner is mono only. Probably caused by
   incorrect audio register information in the datasheet. We are
   waiting for updated information from Conexant.

4) VBI (raw or sliced) has not yet been implemented.

5) MPEG indexing is not yet implemented.

6) The driver is still a bit rough around the edges, this should
   improve over time.


Firmware:

The firmware needs to be extracted from the Windows Hauppauge HVR-1600
driver, available here:

http://hauppauge.lightpath.net/software/install_cd/hauppauge_cd_3.4d1.zip

Unzip, then copy the following files to the firmware directory
and rename them as follows:

Drivers/Driver18/hcw18apu.rom -> v4l-cx23418-apu.fw
Drivers/Driver18/hcw18enc.rom -> v4l-cx23418-cpu.fw
Drivers/Driver18/hcw18mlC.rom -> v4l-cx23418-dig.fw
