ADS Bitsy Single Board Computer
(It is different from Bitsy(iPAQ) of Compaq)

For more details, contact Applied Data Systems or see
http://www.applieddata.net/products.html

The Linux support for this product has been provided by
Woojung Huh <whuh@applieddata.net>

Use 'make adsbitsy_config' before any 'make config'.
This will set up defaults for ADS Bitsy support.

The kernel zImage is linked to be loaded and executed at 0xc0400000.

Linux can  be used with the ADS BootLoader that ships with the
newer rev boards. See their documentation on how to load Linux.

Supported peripherals:
- SA1100 LCD frame buffer (8/16bpp...sort of)
- SA1111 USB Master
- SA1100 serial port
- pcmcia, compact flash
- touchscreen(ucb1200)
- console on LCD screen
- serial ports (ttyS[0-2])
  - ttyS0 is default for serial console

To do:
- everything else!  :-)

Notes:

- The flash on board is divided into 3 partitions.
  You should be careful to use flash on board.
  It's partition is different from GraphicsClient Plus and GraphicsMaster

- 16bpp mode requires a different cable than what ships with the board.
  Contact ADS or look through the manual to wire your own. Currently,
  if you compile with 16bit mode support and switch into a lower bpp
  mode, the timing is off so the image is corrupted.  This will be
  fixed soon.

Any contribution can be sent to nico@cam.org and will be greatly welcome!
