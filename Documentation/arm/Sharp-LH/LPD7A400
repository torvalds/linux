- CPLD memory mapping

  The board designers chose to use high address lines for controlling
  access to the CPLD registers.  It turns out to be a big waste
  because we're using an MMU and must map IO space into virtual
  memory.  The result is that we have to make a mapping for every
  register.

- Serial Console

  It may be OK not to use the serial console option if the user passes
  the console device name to the kernel.  This deserves some exploration.
