Introduction
============

This module will be used to log the events by any module/driver which
enables Inter Processor Communication (IPC). Some of the IPC drivers such
as Message Routers, Multiplexers etc. which act as a passive pipe need
some mechanism to log their events. Since all such IPC drivers handle a
large amount of traffic/events, using kernel logs renders kernel logs
unusable by other drivers and also degrades the performance of IPC
drivers. This new module will help in logging such high frequency IPC
driver events while keeping the standard kernel logging mechanism
intact.

Hardware description
====================

This module does not drive any hardware resource and will only use the
kernel memory-space to log the events.

Software description
====================

Design Goals
------------
This module is designed to
	* support logging for drivers handling large amount of
	  traffic/events
	* define & differentiate events/logs from different drivers
	* support both id-based and stream-based logging
	* support extracting the logs from both live target & memory dump

IPC Log Context
----------------

This module will support logging by multiple drivers. To differentiate
between the multiple drivers that are using this logging mechanism, each
driver will be assigned a unique context by this module. Associated with
each context is the logging space, dynamically allocated from the kernel
memory-space, specific to that context so that the events logged using that
context will not interfere with other contexts.

Event Logging
--------------

Every event will be logged as a <Type: Size: Value> combination. Type
field identifies the type of the event that is logged. Size field represents
the size of the log information. Value field represents the actual
information being logged. This approach will support both id-based logging
and stream-based logging. This approach will also support logging sub-events
of an event. This module will provide helper routines to encode/decode the
logs to/from this format.

Encode Context
---------------

Encode context is a temporary storage space that will be used by the client
drivers to log the events in <Type: Size: Value> format. The client drivers
will perform an encode start operation to initialize the encode context
data structure. Then the client drivers will log their events into the
encode context. Upon completion of event logging, the client drivers will
perform an encode end operation to finalize the encode context data
structure to be logged. Then this updated encode context data structure
will be written into the client driver's IPC Log Context. The maximum
event log size will be defined as 256 bytes.

Log Space
----------

Each context (Figure 1) has an associated log space, which is dynamically
allocated from the kernel memory-space. The log space is organized as a list of
1 or more kernel memory pages. Each page (Figure 2) contains header information
which is used to differentiate the log kernel page from the other kernel pages.

In addition to extracting logs at runtime through DebugFS, IPC Logging has been
designed to allow extraction of logs from a memory dump.  The magic numbers,
timestamps, and context offset are all added to support the memory-dump
extraction use case.

Design
======

Alternate solutions discussed include using kernel & SMEM logs which are
limited in size and hence using them render them unusable by other drivers.
Also kernel logging into serial console is slowing down the performance of
the drivers by multiple times and sometimes lead to APPs watchdog bite.

Performance
===========

This logging mechanism, based on experimental data, is not expected to
cause a significant performance degradation. Under worst case, it can
cause 1 - 2 percent degradation in the throughput of the IPC Drivers.

Dependencies
============

This module will partially depend on CONFIG_DEBUGFS, in order to dump the
logs through debugfs. If CONFIG_DEBUGFS is disabled, the above mentioned
helper functions will perform no operation and return appropriate error
code if the return value is non void. Under such circumstances the logs can
only be extracted through the memory dump.
