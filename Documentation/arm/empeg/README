Empeg, Ltd's Empeg MP3 Car Audio Player

The initial design is to go in your car, but you can use it at home, on a
boat... almost anywhere. The principle is to store CD-quality music using
MPEG technology onto a hard disk in the unit, and use the power of the
embedded computer to serve up the music you want.
