It is somehow important to provide consistent interface to the
userland. LED devices have one problem there, and that is naming of
directories in /sys/class/leds. It would be nice if userland would
just know right "name" for given LED function, but situation got more
complex.

Anyway, if backwards compatibility is not an issue, new code should
use one of the "good" names from this list, and you should extend the
list where applicable.

Legacy names are listed, too; in case you are writing application that
wants to use particular feature, you should probe for good name, first,
but then try the legacy ones, too.

Notice there's a list of functions in include/dt-bindings/leds/common.h .

* Keyboards
  
Good: "input*:*:capslock"
Good: "input*:*:scrolllock"
Good: "input*:*:numlock"

Some phones have touch buttons below screen; it is different from main
keyboard. And this is their backlight.
