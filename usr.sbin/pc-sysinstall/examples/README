pc-sysinstall README

This file documents many of the variables used in pc-sysinstall
config scripts
#################################################################

# hostname=

Using hostname= will set the specified hostname on the
installed system

When hostname= is not present, pc-sysinstall will auto-generate
a hostname such as freebsd-XXXX or pcbsd-XXXX

# installMode=(fresh/upgrade/extract)

Set the type of install we are doing.

Fresh installs will format and mount the target disks before
extracting the install images to the system. Using this mode
it is also possible to do a system restore, by specifying a
full system backup as the install source.

Upgrades will mount the target disk, and extract the system
archive to the disk, overwriting files on the disk. 
The conf/exclude-from-upgrade file can be used to specify
additional files to exclude from overwriting during the
install process.

Extract will skip any disk setup, and perform an installation
to the directory specified by "installLocation=". This location
should be a directory with your pre-mounted file-systems ready
for file extraction. When using the "extract" option, /etc/fstab
on the installed system will *not* be automatically configured. 

# installLocation=

Used only when installMode is set to extract. 

This is set to the location you want to extract your system to,
and should already be mounted properly. 

# installInteractive=(yes or no)

Set if the installer is running in interactive mode, and
is able to prompt for input from the user, defaults to no


########################################################################
# NETWORK SETTINGS
########################################################################

# netDev=(AUTO-DHCP or <nic>)

netDev specifies what type of networking to enable for the installer
Can be set to AUTO-DHCP or to a network interface, such as et0

When set to AUTO-DHCP, pc-sysinstall will probe for all network devices
and attempt to set DHCP mode on each, until a working network connection
is established

If netDev= is set to a network interface such as et0, the following options
will need to be set in order to enable the interface

# netIP=(IP address such as 192.168.0.100)

 Set netIP to an address that you wish to have the interface specified in
 netDev set to
 Only used when netDev is not set to AUTO-DHCP

# netMask=(Netmask such as 255.255.255.0)

Set netMask to the address you with to have the interface specified in
netDev set to
Only used when netDev is not set to AUTO-DHCP

 
# netNameServer=(DNS Server such as 192.168.0.1)

Set netNameServer to the DNS address you want to use during the install
Only used when netDev is not set to AUTO-DHCP


# netDefaultRouter=(192.168.0.1)

Set netDefaultRouter to the gateway you wish to have the installer use
Only used when netDev is not set to AUTO-DHCP



# netSaveDev=(AUTO-DHCP or network interface)

netSaveDev specifies what networking to enable on the installed system

When set to AUTO-DHCP, pc-sysinstall will probe all network interfaces, and
set them all to DHCP in the systems /etc/rc.conf file. Wireless devices will also
have the corresponding wlan[0-9] device created. 

When set to a network interface, pc-sysinstall will set the target device with
the settings specified by the variables below.

# netSaveIP=192.168.0.49
# netSaveMask=255.255.255.0
# netSaveNameServer=208.67.222.222
# netSaveDefaultRouter=192.168.0.1




########################################################################
# DISK SLICE SETTINGS
########################################################################

The following section specifies the target disk(s) to be used in the
install or upgrade. 

# disk0=(disk device, such as ad0)

The diskX= variable should be set to the target device for this drive, such
as ad0, da0
The first should begin with disk0=, and additional drives to disk1=, disk2
if additional disks are to be setup. 

When doing an upgrade, the disk0= line should be set to the root device or 
root zpool of the target system to update. I.E:
 # disk0=tank0
 # disk0=ada0s1a


# partition=(all, free, s1, s1, s3, s4, image)

After setting disk[0-9], the partition= variable is used to specify which target
partition we will be working with for this device.

Setting this to "all" will setup the disk with a single FreeBSD slice as "s1"

Setting this to "free" will allow pc-sysinstall to search for the first available
primary slice with free space, and create the slice. 

Setting this to "s1, s2, s3 or s4" will use the specified MBR slice.

Setting this to "image" will use an image to configure the disk.

(This tag is unused for upgrades)

# partscheme=(MBR/GPT)

When performing a "full" disk (partition=all), the partscheme= variable is used
to determine the partition scheme type gpart will be using on the disk. Valid
choices are MBR or GPT. 

# mirror=(disk device such as ad1)

Setting the mirror= variable will setup the target device as a gmirror
of the diskX= device. The mirror device must be the same size or larger
than the drive being mirrored. 
 

# mirrorbal=(load, prefer, round-robin, split)

Allows the setting of the mirror balance method to be used, if not
specified this defaults to "round-robin"

# bootManager=(none, bsd)

Setting this option will instruct pc-sysinstall to install the BSD boot Manager,
or leave it empty

# image=(/path/to/image/file) (/mountpoint)

Setting this option will instruct pc-sysinstall to write the image file
specified by the path to the disk.

# commitDiskPart

This command must be placed at the end of the diskX= section, before starting
the listing of any additional diskX= directives. 


########################################################################
# DISK PARTITION / MOUNT SETTINGS
########################################################################

The following settings specify the partitioning / mount points to setup
on the target partition

# disk0-part=UFS+S 500 / (-n -o time)
# disk0-part=SWAP 2000 none
# disk0-part=UFS.eli 500 /usr
# encpass=mypass
# disk0-part=UFS+J 500 /tmp
# disk0-part=ZFS 0 /data,/storage (mirror: ad1)
# commitDiskLabel

The above values instructs pc-sysinstall which partitions / mounts
to create on the target drive / slice, specified by "disk0".
(disk0 will resolve to the drive / slice specified in the previous section)

The notation is as follows:
<File System Type> <Size> <Mountpoint>

Available FileSystems: 
  UFS - Standard UFS2 FileSystem
UFS+S - UFS2 + Softupdates enabled
UFS+SUJ - UFS2 + Soft Updates + Journaling enabled
UFS+J - UFS2 + Journaling through gjournal
  ZFS - Z File System, pools / mounts created automatically
 SWAP - BSD Swap space partition, mountpoint should be set to "none"

Adding the ".eli" extension to any of the above file systems
will enable disk encryption via geli
(UFS.eli, UFS+S.eli, UFS+SUJ.eli, UFS+J.eli, ZFS.eli, SWAP.eli)

If you with to use a passphrase with this encrypted partition, on the next line
the flag "encpass=" should be entered:
encpass=mypass

All sizes are expressed in MegaBytes
Specifying a size 0 instructs pc-sysinstall to use the rest of the 
available slice size, and should only be used for the last partition / mount

When using "UFS" and its various types, it is possible to specify custom options
for newfs using (). For examplei:
disk0-part=UFS+SUJ 1000 / (-o time)
In this case "-o time" would be passed to newfs when creating the "/" filesystem.


When using "ZFS" specifically, it is possible to specify additional disks / partitions
to include in the zpool. By using the syntax: (mirror: ad1,ad2) or (raidz: ad1,ad2), it is possible
to include the disk "ad1" into the zpool for this partition, using the raidz / mirror methods.
If you with to just include the disk into the pool in "basic" mode, then use (ad1,ad2) with no flags
