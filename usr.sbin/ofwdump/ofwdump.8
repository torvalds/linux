.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to examine the Open Firmware device tree.
In the first synopsis form, the complete device tree is printed; in the
second form, only the selected
.Ar nodes
will be examined.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl P Ar property"
.It Fl a
Print the complete device tree.
.It Fl p
Print all available properties.
.It Fl P Ar property
Only print properties of the given name.
.It Fl R
Print properties in
.Dq raw
format, i.e., omit all headings and indentation and just write the
property values unaltered to the standard output.
This is intended to be used with the
.Fl P
option to extract the value of a single property.
.It Fl S
Print properties as strings; this is analogous to the
.Fl R
option, except that each property is only output to the first
.Dv NUL
character, and that newline is appended to each.
.It Fl r
Recursively print all children of the specified nodes.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Print the complete device tree:
.Pp
.Dl "ofwdump -a"
.Pp
Print the complete device subtree of the
.Dq Li /pci
node, including all available properties:
.Pp
.Dl "ofwdump -pr /pci"
.Pp
Print the
.Dq Li compatible
property of the
.Dq Li /pci
node as plain string:
.Pp
.Dl "ofwdump -P compatible -S /pci"
