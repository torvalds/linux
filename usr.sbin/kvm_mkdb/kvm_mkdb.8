.Nm kvm_mkdb
.Nd create kernel database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kvm_mkdb
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl o Ar directory
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm kvm_mkdb
creates a database in
.Pa /var/db
containing information about the specified file.
If no file is specified,
.Pa /bsd
is used by default.
The file is named
.Pa kvm_filename.db ,
where
.Ar filename
is the name of the file read.
Various library routines consult this database.
The only information currently stored is the kernel namelist, which is
used by the
.Xr kvm_nlist 3
function.
However, in the future the database may contain other static
information about the current system.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-o directory"
.It Fl o Ar directory
Allows the specification of a
.Ar directory
other than
.Pa /var/db
for the database to be created in.
.It Fl v
Yields slightly more verbose operation.
