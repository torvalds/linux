.Sh DESCRIPTION
The database is implemented as a modified prefix B+tree.
Instead of modifying the database file inplace,
each update appends any modified pages at the end of the file.
The last block of the file contains metadata and a pointer to the root page.
The first block of the file contains a header that specifies the page size.
.Pp
Append-only writing gives the following properties:
.Bl -enum
.It
No locks.
Since all writes are appended to the end of the file, multiple
readers can continue reading from the tree as it was when they
started.
This snapshot view might contain outdated versions of entries.
.It
Resistance to corruption.
The file content is never modified.
When opening a database file, the last good meta-data page is searched
by scanning backwards.
If there is trailing garbage in the file, it will be skipped.
.It
Hot backups.
Backups can be made on a running server simply by copying the files.
There is no risk for inconsistencies.
.El
.Pp
The drawback is that it wastes space.
A 4-level B+tree database will write at least 5 new pages on each update,
including the meta-data page.
With 4 KiB pagesize, the file would grow by 20 KiB on each update.
.Pp
To reclaim the wasted space, the database should be compacted.
The compaction process opens a write transaction and traverses the tree.
Each active page is then written to a new file.
When complete, a special
.Dq tombstone
page is written to the old file to
signal that it is stale and all processes using the file should re-open it.
Modifications are denied on a stale file and fail with errno set to ESTALE.
.Sh CURSORS
A new cursor may be opened with a call to
.Fn btree_txn_cursor_open
or
.Fn btree_cursor_open .
The latter is implemented as a macro to the former with a NULL
.Ar txn
argument.
Multiple cursors may be open simultaneously.
The cursor must be closed with
.Fn btree_cursor_close
after use.
.Pp
The cursor can be placed at a specific key by setting
.Ar op
to BT_CURSOR and filling in the
.Ar key
argument.
The cursor will be placed at the smallest key greater or equal to
the specified key.
If
.Ar op
is instead set to BT_CURSOR_EXACT, the cursor will be placed at the
specified key, or fail if it doesn't exist.
.Pp
The database may be traversed from the first key to the last by calling
.Fn btree_cursor_get
with
.Ar op
initially set to BT_FIRST and then set to BT_NEXT.
If the cursor is not yet initialized, ie
.Fn btree_cursor_get
has not yet been called with
.Ar op
set to BT_FIRST or BT_CURSOR, then BT_NEXT behaves as BT_FIRST.
.Sh TRANSACTIONS
There are two types of transactions: write and read-only transactions.
Only one write transaction is allowed at a time.
A read-only transaction allows the grouping of several read operations
to see a consistent state of the database.
.Pp
A transaction is started with
.Fn btree_txn_begin .
If the
.Ar rdonly
parameter is 0, a write transaction is started and an exclusive lock
is taken on the file using
.Xr flock 2 .
No lock is taken for read-only transactions.
.Pp
The transaction is ended either with
.Fn btree_txn_commit
or
.Fn btree_txn_abort .
The
.Ft btree_txn
pointer must not be accessed afterwards.
Any cursor opened inside the transaction must be closed before the
transaction is ended.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn btree_txn_get ,
.Fn btree_txn_put ,
.Fn btree_txn_del ,
.Fn btree_txn_commit ,
.Fn btree_get ,
.Fn btree_put ,
.Fn btree_del ,
.Fn btree_cursor_get ,
.Fn btree_compact
and
.Fn btree_revert
functions all return 0 on success.
On failure -1 is returned and errno is set.
.Pp
All functions returning pointers return NULL on error.
.Pp
.Fn btree_txn_put
and
.Fn btree_put
sets errno to EEXIST if the key already exists and BT_NOOVERWRITE was not
passed in the
.Ar flags
argument.
.Pp
.Fn btree_txn_get ,
.Fn btree_txn_del ,
.Fn btree_get ,
.Fn btree_del
and
.Fn btree_cursor_get
sets errno to ENOENT if the specified key was not found.
.Pp
The
.Fn btree_txn_begin ,
.Fn btree_cursor ,
.Fn btree_cursor_get ,
.Fn btree_get ,
.Fn btree_put ,
.Fn btree_del
functions can fail and set errno to ESTALE if the database file has been
compacted by another process.
The file should be re-opened and the operation retried.
