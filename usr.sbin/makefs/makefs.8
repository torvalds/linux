.Op Fl t Ar fs-type
.Ar image-file
.Ar directory | manifest
.Op Ar extra-directory ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The utility
.Nm
creates a file system image into
.Ar image-file
from the directory tree
.Ar directory
or from the mtree manifest
.Ar manifest .
If any optional directory trees are passed in the
.Ar extra-directory
arguments, then the directory tree of each argument will be merged
into the
.Ar directory
or
.Ar manifest
first before creating
.Ar image-file .
No special devices or privileges are required to perform this task.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl B Ar endian
Set the byte order of the image to
.Ar endian .
Valid byte orders are
.Ql 4321 ,
.Ql big ,
or
.Ql be
for big endian, and
.Ql 1234 ,
.Ql little ,
or
.Ql le
for little endian.
Some file systems may have a fixed byte order; in those cases this
argument will be ignored.
.It Fl b Ar free-blocks
Ensure that a minimum of
.Ar free-blocks
free blocks exist in the image.
An optional
.Ql %
suffix may be provided to indicate that
.Ar free-blocks
indicates a percentage of the calculated image size.
.It Fl D
Treat duplicate paths in an mtree manifest as warnings not error.
.It Fl d Ar debug-mask
Enable various levels of debugging, depending upon which bits are
set in
.Ar debug-mask .
XXX: document these
.It Fl F Ar mtree-specfile
.Em This is almost certainly not the option you are looking for.
To create an image from a list of files in an mtree format manifest,
specify it as the last argument on the commandline, not as a the
argument to
.Fl F .
.Pp
Use
.Ar mtree-specfile
as an
.Xr mtree 8
.Sq specfile
specification.
This option has no effect when the image is created from a mtree manifest
rather than a directory.
.Pp
If a specfile entry exists in the underlying file system, its
permissions and modification time will be used unless specifically
overridden by the specfile.
An error will be raised if the type of entry in the specfile
conflicts with that of an existing entry.
.Pp
In the opposite case (where a specfile entry does not have an entry
in the underlying file system) the following occurs:
If the specfile entry is marked
.Sy optional ,
the specfile entry is ignored.
Otherwise, the entry will be created in the image, and it is
necessary to specify at least the following parameters in the
specfile:
.Sy type ,
.Sy mode ,
.Sy gname ,
or
.Sy gid ,
and
.Sy uname
or
.Sy uid ,
and
.Sy link
(in the case of symbolic links).
If
.Sy time
isn't provided, the current time will be used.
If
.Sy flags
isn't provided, the current file flags will be used.
Missing regular file entries will be created as zero-length files.
.It Fl f Ar free-files
Ensure that a minimum of
.Ar free-files
free files (inodes) exist in the image.
An optional
.Ql %
suffix may be provided to indicate that
.Ar free-files
indicates a percentage of the calculated image size.
.It Fl M Ar minimum-size
Set the minimum size of the file system image to
.Ar minimum-size .
.It Fl m Ar maximum-size
Set the maximum size of the file system image to
.Ar maximum-size .
An error will be raised if the target file system needs to be larger
than this to accommodate the provided directory tree.
.It Fl N Ar userdb-dir
Use the user database text file
.Pa master.passwd
and group database text file
.Pa group
from
.Ar userdb-dir ,
rather than using the results from the system's
.Xr getpwnam 3
and
.Xr getgrnam 3
(and related) library calls.
.It Fl O Ar offset
Instead of creating the filesystem at the beginning of the file, start
at offset.
Valid only for
.Sy ffs .
.It Fl o Ar fs-options
Set file system specific options.
.Ar fs-options
is a comma separated list of options.
Valid file system specific options are detailed below.
.It Fl p
Deprecated.
See the
.Fl Z
flag.
.It Fl R Ar roundup-size
Round the image up to
.Ar roundup-size .
.Ar roundup-size
should be a multiple of the file system block size.
This option only applies to the
.Sy ffs
file system type.
.It Fl S Ar sector-size
Set the file system sector size to
.Ar sector-size .
.\" XXX: next line also true for cd9660?
Defaults to 512.
.It Fl s Ar image-size
Set the size of the file system image to
.Ar image-size .
.It Fl T Ar timestamp
Specify a timestamp to be set for all filesystem files and directories
created so that repeatable builds are possible.
The
.Ar timestamp
can be a
.Pa pathname ,
where the timestamps are derived from that file, or an integer
value interpreted as the number of seconds from the Epoch.
Note that timestamps specified in an
.Xr mtree 5
spec file, override the default timestamp.
.It Fl t Ar fs-type
Create an
.Ar fs-type
file system image.
The following file system types are supported:
.Bl -tag -width cd9660 -offset indent
.It Sy ffs
BSD fast file system (default).
.It Sy cd9660
ISO 9660 file system.
.El
.It Fl x
Exclude file system nodes not explicitly listed in the specfile.
.It Fl Z
Create a sparse file for
.Sy ffs .
This is useful for virtual machine images.
.El
.Pp
Where sizes are specified, a decimal number of bytes is expected.
Two or more numbers may be separated by an
.Dq x
to indicate a product.
Each number may have one of the following optional suffixes:
.Bl -tag -width 3n -offset indent -compact
.It b
Block; multiply by 512
.It k
Kibi; multiply by 1024 (1 KiB)
.It m
Mebi; multiply by 1048576 (1 MiB)
.It g
Gibi; multiply by 1073741824 (1 GiB)
.It t
Tebi; multiply by 1099511627776 (1 TiB)
.It w
Word; multiply by the number of bytes in an integer
.El
