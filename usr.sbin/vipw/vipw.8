.Sh NAME
.Nm vipw
.Nd edit the password file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vipw
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
edits the password file after setting the appropriate locks,
and does any necessary processing after the password file is unlocked.
If the password file is already locked for editing by another user,
.Nm
will ask you
to try again later.
The default editor for
.Nm
is
.Xr vi 1 .
.Pp
.Nm
performs a number of consistency checks on the password entries,
and will not allow a password file with a
.Dq mangled
entry to be
installed.
If
.Nm
rejects the new password file, the user is prompted to re-enter
the edit session.
.Pp
Once the information has been verified,
.Nm
uses
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8
to update the user database.
This is run in the background and,
at very large sites, could take several minutes.
Until this update
is completed, the password file is unavailable for other updates
and the new information is not available to programs.
.Pp
Which type of cipher is used to encrypt the password information
depends on the configuration in
.Xr login.conf 5 .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If the following environment variable exists, it will be utilized by
.Nm vipw :
.Bl -tag -width EDITOR
.It Ev EDITOR
The editor specified by the string
.Ev EDITOR
will be invoked instead of the default editor
.Xr vi 1 .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/master.passwdXXX" -compact
