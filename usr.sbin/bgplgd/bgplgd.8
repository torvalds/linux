.Sh NAME
.Nm bgplgd
.Nd a bgpctl FastCGI server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl p Ar path
.Op Fl S Ar socket
.Op Fl s Ar socket
.Op Fl U Ar user
.Op Fl V
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a server which implements the FastCGI Protocol to execute
.Xr bgpctl 8
commands.
.Nm
is a simple server that implements a simple web API to query
.Xr bgpd 8 .
.Pp
.Nm
opens a socket at
.Pa /var/www/run/bgplgd.sock ,
owned by www:www,
with permissions 0660.
It will then drop privileges to user
.Qq _bgplgd ,
.Xr unveil 2
the
.Xr bgpctl 8
binary
and restrict itself with
.Xr pledge 2 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to stderr.
.It Fl p Ar path
Use
.Ar path
instead of
.Xr bgpctl 8
to query
.Xr bgpd 8 .
.It Fl S Ar socket
Use
.Ar socket
instead of the default
.Pa /var/run/bgpd.rsock
to communicate with
.Xr bgpd 8 .
.It Fl s Ar socket
Create and bind to alternative local socket at
.Ar socket .
.It Fl U Ar user
Change the owner of
.Pa /var/www/run/bgplgd.sock
to
.Ar user
and its primary group instead of the default www:www.
.It Fl V
Show the version and exit.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
provides the following API endpoints.
Unless further specified the endpoints do not take any parameters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "/interfaces" -compact
.It Pa /interfaces
Show the interface states.
.It Pa /memory
Show RIB memory statistics.
.It Pa /metrics
Output various statistics in OpenMetrics format.
.It Pa /neighbors
Show detailed neighbors information.
The output can be limited with the following parameters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "neighbor=peer" -compact
.It Cm neighbor Ns = Ns Ar peer
Show information for a specific neighbor.
.Ar peer
may be the neighbor's address or description.
.It Cm group Ns = Ns Ar name
Show only entries from the specified peer group.
.El
.It Pa /nexthops
Show the list of BGP nexthops and the result of their validity check.
.It Pa /rib
.It Pa /rib/in
.It Pa /rib/out
Show routes from the bgpd(8) Routing Information Base.
For
.Pa /rib/in
the
.Ar Adj-RIB-In
will be queried and for
.Pa /rib/out
the
.Ar Adj-RIB-out .
The following parameters can be used to filter the output:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "neighbor=peer" -compact
.It Cm neighbor Ns = Ns Ar peer
Show information for a specific neighbor.
.Ar peer
may be the neighbor's address or description.
.It Cm group Ns = Ns Ar name
Show only entries from the specified peer group.
.It Cm as Ns = Ns Ar number
Show only entries with the specified source AS number.
.It Cm community Ns = Ns Ar string
.It Cm ext-community Ns = Ns Ar string
.It Cm large-community Ns = Ns Ar string
Show only entries that match the specified community.
.It Xo
.Ic af Ns = Ns
.Pq Ic ipv4 | ipv6 | vpnv4 | vpnv6
.Xc
Show only entries that match the specified address family.
.It Cm rib Ns = Ns Ar name
Show only entries from the RIB with name
.Ar name .
Can only be used with the
.Pa /rib
endpoint.
.It Xo
.Ic ovs Ns = Ns
.Pq Ic valid | not-found | invalid
.Xc
Show only prefixes that match the specified Origin Validation State.
.It Xo
.Ic avs Ns = Ns
.Pq Ic valid | invalid | unknown
.Xc
Show only prefixes that match the specified ASPA Validation State.
.It Cm best Ns = Ns 1
Show only selected routes.
.It Cm error Ns = Ns 1
Show only prefixes which are marked invalid and were treated as withdrawn.
.It Cm filtered Ns = Ns 1
Show only prefixes which are marked filtered by the input filter.
.It Cm invalid Ns = Ns 1
Show only prefixes which are not eligible.
.It Cm leaked Ns = Ns 1
Show only prefixes where a route leak was detected.
.It Cm prefix Ns = Ns Ar addr
Show only entries that match prefix either as the best matching route or
show the entry for this CIDR prefix.
.It Cm all Ns = Ns 1
Show all entries in the specified prefix range.
.It Cm or-shorter Ns = Ns 1
Show all entries covering and including the specified prefix.
.El
.It Pa /rtr
Show a list of all RTR sessions.
.It Pa /sets
Show a list summarizing all roa-set, as-set, prefix-set, and origin-set tables.
.It Pa /summary
Show a list of all neighbors, including information about the session state
and message counters.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Add the following to
.Pa /etc/bgpd.conf
to have
.Xr bgpd 8
open a second, restricted, control socket:
.Pp
.Dl socket \&"/var/run/bgpd.rsock\&" restricted
.Pp
An example setup in
.Xr httpd 8
is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
        location "/bgplgd/*" {
                fastcgi socket "/run/bgplgd.sock"
                request strip 1
        }
