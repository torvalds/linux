.Sh NAME
.Nm quot
.Nd display disk space occupied by each user
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl acfhknv
.Op Ar filesystem ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
is used to gather statistics about the disk usage for each local user.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Include statistics for all mounted file systems.
.It Fl c
Display three columns containing number of blocks per file,
number of files in this category, and aggregate total of
blocks in files with this or lower size.
.It Fl f
For each user, display count of files and space occupied.
.It Fl h
Estimate the number of blocks in each file based on its size.
Despite that this does not give the correct results (it does not
account for the holes in files), this option is not any faster
and thus is discouraged.
.It Fl k
Force the numbers to be reported in kilobyte counts.
By default, all sizes are reported in 512-byte block counts.
.It Fl n
Given a list of inodes (plus some optional data on each line)
in the standard input, for each file print out the owner (plus
the remainder of the input line).
This is traditionally used
in the pipe:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.\" ncheck filesystem | sort +0n | quot -n filesystem
ls -i | sed -e 's,^  *,,' | sort -k 1n | quot -n filesystem
.Ed
.Pp
to get a report of files and their owners.
.It Fl v
In addition to the default output, display the number of files
not accessed within 30, 60 and 90 days.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environment variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, and the
.Fl k
option is not specified, the block counts will be displayed in units of that
size block.

.Xr mount 8
.Sh HISTORY
This implementation of
.Nm
is by
.An Wolfgang Solfrank
/ TooLs GmbH.
.Sh BUGS
.Xr ncheck
(which would be a lot more useful than
.Nm ls Fl i
in the example above)
does not exist in
.Fx .
