.Sh NAME
.Nm mrinfo
.Nd displays configuration info from a multicast router
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mrinfo
.Op Fl d Ns Op Ar debug_level
.Op Fl r Ar retry_count
.Op Fl t Ar timeout_count
.Ar multicast_router
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
attempts to display the configuration information from the specified
.Ar multicast_router .
.Pp
.Nm
uses the ASK_NEIGHBORS IGMP message to query the specified multicast
router.
If the router responds, the version number and a list of their
neighboring multicast router addresses is part of the response.
If the responding router has a recent multicast version number, then
.Nm
requests additional information such as metrics, thresholds,
and flags from the multicast router.
Once the specified multicast router responds,
the configuration is displayed to the standard output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width timeout_levelxyz
.It Fl d Ns Op Ar debug_level
sets the debug level.
When the debug level is greater than the default value of 0,
additional debugging messages are printed.
Regardless of the debug level,
an error condition will always write an error message and cause
.Nm
to terminate.
Non-zero debug levels have the following effects (printed to stderr):
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 1n -compact -offset indent
.It 1
packet warnings.
.It 2
all level 1 messages plus notifications of down networks.
.It 3
all level 2 messages plus notifications of all packet timeouts.
.El
.It Fl r Ar retry_count
sets the neighbor query retry limit.
The default is to do 3 retries.
.It Fl t Ar timeout_count
sets the number of seconds to wait for a neighbor query reply.
The default timeout is 4 seconds.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal
# mrinfo mbone.phony.dom.net
127.148.176.10 (mbone.phony.dom.net) [version 3.3]:
 127.148.176.10 -> 0.0.0.0 (?) [1/1/querier]
 127.148.176.10 -> 127.0.8.4 (mbone2.phony.dom.net) [1/45/tunnel]
 127.148.176.10 -> 105.1.41.9 (momoney.com) [1/32/tunnel/down]
 127.148.176.10 -> 143.192.152.119 (mbone.dipu.edu) [1/32/tunnel]
.Ed
.Pp
For each neighbor of the queried multicast router, the IP of the queried router
is displayed, followed by the IP and name of the neighbor.
In square brackets the metric (cost of connection)
and threshold (multicast ttl) is displayed.
If the queried multicast router has a newer version number, the type (tunnel,
srcrt) and status (disabled, down) of the connection is displayed.
