.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to send or receive messages over an
SMBus, see
.Xr smbus 4 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility has two different modi of operation.
The first form shown in the synopsis can be used to
.Dq probe
the devices on the SMBus.
This is done by sending each valid device address one
receive byte, and one quick read message, respectively.
Devices that respond to these requests will be displayed
by their device address, followed by the strings
.Ql r ,
.Ql w ,
or
.Ql rw ,
for devices that are readable, writeable, or both, readable
and writeable, respectively.
The only valid additional option for this modus of operation (besides
the
.Fl p
option that chooses the modus) is
.Fl f Ar dev .
See below for a description.
.Pp
Note that probing the bus is risky, since individual devices could
perform unwanted actions upon receiving one of the mentioned messages.
For example, if a particular SMBus device considers
.Em any
write operation issued to it as a request to power off the system,
the probing would trigger this action.
.Pp
The second form shown in the synopsis can be used to send or receive
arbitrary messages to or from individual devices.
This might be useful to explore individual devices on the SMBus, or
maybe even to write short shell scripts performing maintenance
operations on the bus.
.Pp
Any data values on the command-line are integer values in the
range 0 through 255 for byte values, or 0 through 65535 for
word values.
They can be specified using standard
.Ql C
notation (prefix 0 for octal interpretation, or 0x for
hexadecimal interpretation).
.Pp
Since the low-order bit of the device address of SMBus devices
selects between read and write operations, only even-numbered
slave addresses can exist on the bus.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl o Ar outcnt"
.It Fl F Ar fmt
Specify the
.Xr printf 3
format to be used for displaying input data.
This option is ignored in messages that do not read any input
from the SMBus device.
The format defaults to
.Ql 0x%02x
for byte input operations, and to
.Ql 0x%04x
for word input operations.
For multi-byte input (block read), the same format is used for
each individual byte read from the SMBus.
.It Fl c Ar cmd
This is the value of the
.Em command
byte to be issued as part of the SMBus message.
.It Fl f Ar dev
This specifies that
.Ar dev
should be used as the connection to the SMBus, rather than the
default of
.Pa /dev/smb0 .
.It Fl i Ar incnt
An SMBus message should be generated to read
.Ar incnt
bytes from the device.
.It Fl o Ar outcnt
An SMBus message should be generated to write
.Ar outcnt
bytes to the device.
The data values to write are expected to follow all of the options
(and their arguments) on the command-line, where the number of data
bytes must match the
.Ar outcnt
value.
.It Fl p
This selects the
.Em probe bus
modus of operation.
.It Fl s Ar slave
The
.Ar slave
parameter specifies which SMBus device to connect to.
This option also selects the
.Em transfer messages from/to device
modus of operation, where a slave address is mandatory.
.It Fl w
This option specifies that IO operations are word operations,
rather than byte operations.
Either
.Ar incnt ,
or
.Ar outcnt
(or both) must be equal 2 in this case.
Note that the SMBus byte order is defined to be little-endian
(low byte first, high byte follows).
.El
.Pp
Not all argument combinations make sense in order to form valid SMBus
messages.
If no
.Fl c Ar cmd
option has been provided, the following messages can be
issued:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
.TS
l r r.
\fBmessage	incnt	outcnt\fR
quick read	0	\&-
quick write	\&-	0
receive byte	1	\&-
send byte	\&-	1
.TE
.Ed
.Pp
Note in particular that specifying 0 as a count value
has a different meaning than omitting the respective
option entirely.
.Pp
If a command value has been given using the
.Fl c Ar cmd
option, the following messages can be generated:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
.TS
l l r r.
\fBmessage	\&-w	incnt	outcnt\fR
read byte	no	1	\&-
write byte	no	\&-	1
read word	yes	2	\&-
write word	yes	\&-	2
process call	yes	2	2
block read	no	\*(Ge 2	\&-
block write	no	\&-	\*(Ge 2
.TE
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /dev/smb0" -compact
.It Pa /dev/smb0
The default device to connect to, unless
.Fl f Ar dev
has been provided.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
Exit status is 0 on success, or according to
.Xr sysexits 3
in case of failure.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Typical usage examples of the
.Nm
command include:
.Pp
.Dl "smbmsg -f /dev/smb1 -p"
.Pp
Probe all devices on the SMBus attached to
.Pa /dev/smb1 .
.Pp
.Dl "smbmsg -s 0x70 -i 1"
.Pp
Issue a
.Em receive byte
message to the device at address 0x70, and display
the received byte using the default format.
.Pp
.Dl "smbmsg -s 0x70 -c 0xff -i 1 -F %d"
.Pp
Issue a
.Em read byte
message to the device at slave address 0x70, using
255 (0xff) as the command-byte to send to the device,
and display the result using the custom format
.Ql %d .
.Pp
.Dl "smbmsg -s 0xa0 -c 0 -o 1 0x80"
.Pp
Send a
.Em write byte
message to the slave device at address 0xa0, using
0 as the command-byte value, and 0x80 as the byte to
send (after the command).
Assuming this might be a Philips PCF8583 real-time clock,
this would stop the clock.
.Pp
.Dl "smbmsg -s 0xa0 -c 1 -i 6 -F %02x"
.Pp
Send a
.Em block read
command to device at address 0xa0, and read 6 bytes from
it, using hexadecimal display.
Again, assuming a PCF8583 RTC, this would display the
fractions of second, seconds, minutes, hours, year/date,
and weekday/month values.
Since this RTC uses BCD notation, the actual values displayed
were decimal then.
.Pp
.Dl "smbmsg -s 0xa0 -c 2 -o 5 0x00 0x07 0x22 0x16 0x05"
.Pp
Send a
.Em block write
command to device at address 0xa0.
For the PCF8583 RTC, this would set the clock to Sunday (2004%4)-05-16
22:07:00.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Diagnostic messages issued are supposed to be self-explanatory.
