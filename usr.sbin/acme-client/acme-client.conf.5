.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm acme-client.conf
.Nd acme-client configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is divided into the following main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sx Macros
Definitions of variables that can be used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sx Authorities
Certificate authorities (CAs) that can be contacted via ACME.
.It Sx Domains
Certificate specifications.
.El
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/acme-client.sub.conf"
.Ed
.Pp
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.
.Pp
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, underscore, or '/'
must be quoted.
.Ss Macros
A macro is defined with a command of the form
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value .
The macro
.Ar name
can contain letters, digits, and underscores and cannot be a reserved word.
Within unquoted arguments, the string
.Pf $ Ar name
is later expanded to
.Ar value .
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
api_url="https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
authority letsencrypt {
	api url $api_url
	account key "/etc/acme/letsencrypt-privkey.pem"
}
.Ed
.Ss Authorities
The configured certificate authorities.
.Pp
Each authority section starts with a declaration of the name identifying a
certificate authority.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic authority Ar name Brq ...
The
.Ar name
is a string used to reference this certificate authority.
.El
.Pp
It is followed by a block of options enclosed in curly brackets:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic account key Ar file Op Ar keytype
Specify a
.Ar file
used to identify the user of this certificate authority.
.Ar keytype
can be
.Cm rsa
or
.Cm ecdsa .
It defaults to
.Cm rsa .
.It Ic api url Ar url
Specify the
.Ar url
under which the ACME API is reachable.
.It Ic contact Ar contact
Optional
.Ar contact
URLs that the authority can use to contact the client for issues related to
this account.
.El
.Ss Domains
The certificates to be obtained through ACME.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic domain Ar handle Brq ...
Each domain section begins with the
.Ic domain
keyword followed by an identifier for this domain block.
.El
.Pp
It is followed by a block of options enclosed in curly brackets:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic domain name Ar name
The
.Ar name
to be used as the common name component of the subject of the
X.509 certificate.
This is optional.
If not specified, the
.Ar handle
of the domain block will be used as common name.
.It Ic alternative names Brq ...
A list of alternative names,
comma or space separated,
for which the certificate will be valid.
The common name is included automatically if this option is present,
but there is no automatic conversion/inclusion between "www." and
plain domain name forms.
.It Ic domain key Ar file Op Ar keytype
The private key file for which the certificate will be obtained.
.Ar keytype
can be
.Cm rsa
or
.Cm ecdsa .
It defaults to
.Cm rsa .
If the key file does not exist,
.Xr acme-client 1
will generate a key itself (4096-bit for
.Cm rsa
or secp384r1 for
.Cm ecdsa ) .
.It Ic domain certificate Ar file
The filename of the certificate that will be issued.
This is optional if
.Ar domain full chain certificate
is specified.
A backup with name
.Ar file.1
is created if
.Ar file
exists.
.It Ic domain chain certificate Ar file
The filename in which to store the certificate chain
that will be returned by the certificate authority.
It needs to be in the same directory as the
.Ar domain certificate
(or in a subdirectory) and can be specified as a relative or absolute path.
This setting is optional.
A backup with name
.Ar file.1
is created if
.Ar file
exists.
.It Ic domain full chain certificate Ar file
The filename in which to store the full certificate chain
that will be returned by the certificate authority.
It needs to be in the same directory as the
.Ar domain certificate
(or in a subdirectory) and can be specified as a relative or absolute path.
This is a combination of the
.Ar domain certificate
and the
.Ar domain chain certificate
in one file, and is required by most browsers.
This is optional if
.Ar domain certificate
is specified.
A backup with name
.Ar file.1
is created if
.Ar file
exists.
.It Ic profile Ar profile
The certificate profile to be requested.
If this setting is absent, no profile request is made.
.It Ic sign with Ar authority
The certificate authority (as declared above in the
.Sx Authorities
section) to use.
If this setting is absent, the first authority specified is used.
.It Ic challengedir Ar path
The directory in which the challenge file will be stored.
If it is not specified, a default of
.Pa /var/www/acme
will be used.
