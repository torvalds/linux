.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility queries the
.Em Resource Public Key Infrastructure Pq RPKI
repository system with a built-in HTTPS client and
.Xr openrsync 1
to fetch all X.509 certificates, manifests, and revocation lists under a given
.Em Trust Anchor .
.Nm
subsequently validates each
.Em Signed Object
by constructing and verifying a certification path for the certificate
associated with the Object (including checking relevant CRLs).
.Nm
produces lists of the
.Em Validated ROA Payloads Pq VRPs ,
.Em BGPsec Router Keys Pq BRKs ,
and
.Em Validated ASPA Payloads Pq VAPs
in various formats.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 0
Include hazardous AS0 TALs in the output files.
AS0 TALs are not recommended for automatic filtering of BGP routes.
The default is not to include them.
.It Fl A
Exclude the ASPA-set from the output files that support it (BIRD, JSON, and
OpenBGPD).
.It Fl B
Create output in the file
.Pa bird
in the output directory suitable for BIRD internet routing daemon version
2.16 and up.
For compatibility with earlier versions, use
.Fl A .
The validated payload table names are
.Em ROAS4 ,
.Em ROAS6 ,
and
.Em ASPAS .
.It Fl b Ar sourceaddr
Tell the HTTP and rsync clients to use
.Ar sourceaddr
as the source address for connections, which is useful on machines
with multiple interfaces.
.It Fl c
Create output in the file
.Pa csv
in the output directory as comma-separated values of the
.Em Autonomous System ,
the prefix in slash notation, the maximum prefix length, an abbreviation for
the
.Em Trust Anchor
the entry is derived from, and the moment the VRP will expire derived from
the chain of X.509 certificates and CRLs in seconds since the Epoch, UTC.
.It Fl d Ar cachedir
The directory where
.Nm
will store the cached repository data.
Defaults to
.Pa /var/cache/rpki-client .
.It Fl e Ar rsync_prog
Use
.Ar rsync_prog
instead of
.Xr openrsync 1
to fetch repositories.
It must accept the
.Fl rt
and
.Fl -address
flags and connect with rsync-protocol locations.
.It Fl f Ar
Attempt to decode and validate the RPKI object in
.Ar file
using the cache stored in
.Ar cachedir
and print human-readable information about the object.
If
.Ar file
is an rsync:// URI, the corresponding file from the cache will be used.
This option implies
.Fl n ,
and can be combined with
.Fl j
to emit a stream of
.Em Concatenated JSON .
This option is intended for debugging.
.It Fl H Ar fqdn
Create a shortlist and add
.Ar fqdn
to the shortlist.
.Nm
only connects to shortlisted hosts.
The shortlist filter is enforced during processing of the
.Em Subject Information Access Pq SIA
extension in CA certificates, thus applies to both RSYNC and RRDP connections.
This option can be used multiple times.
.It Fl j
Create output in the file
.Pa json
in the output directory as JSON object.
See
.Fl c
for a description of the fields.
.It Fl m
Create output in the file
.Pa metrics
in the output directory in OpenMetrics format.
.It Fl n
Offline mode.
Validate the contents of
.Ar cachedir
and write to
.Ar outputdir
without synchronizing via RRDP or RSYNC.
.It Fl o
Create output in the file
.Pa openbgpd
in the output directory as
.Xr bgpd 8
compatible input.
If the
.Fl B ,
.Fl c ,
and
.Fl j
options are not specified this is the default.
.It Fl P Ar posix-seconds
Specify the time for the evaluation in
.Ar posix-seconds
seconds from the unix epoch.
This overrides the default of using the current system time.
.It Fl p Ar threads
Validate using the specified number of threads.
The default is two.
Has no effect in combination with
.Fl f .
.It Fl R
Disable RRDP, synchronize only via RSYNC.
.It Fl S Ar skiplist
Do not connect to hosts listed in the
.Ar skiplist
file.
Entries in the
.Ar skiplist
are newline separated
.Em Fully Qualified Domain Names Pq FQDNs .
A
.Ql #
indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of the line are
not interpreted.
The skip filter is enforced during processing of the
.Em Subject Information Access Pq SIA
extension in CA certificates, thus applies to both RSYNC and RRDP connections.
By default load entries from
.Pa /etc/rpki/skiplist .
.It Fl s Ar timeout
Terminate after
.Ar timeout
seconds of runtime, because normal practice will restart from
.Xr cron 8 .
Disable by specifying 0.
Defaults to 1 hour.
Individual RSYNC/RRDP repositories are timed out after one fourth of
.Em timeout .
All network synchronisation tasks are aborted after seven eights of
.Em timeout .
.It Fl t Ar tal
Specify a
.Em Trust Anchor Locator Pq TAL
file to be used.
This option can be used multiple times to load multiple TALs.
By default
.Nm
will load all TAL files in
.Pa /etc/rpki .
TAL are small files containing a public key and URL endpoint address.
.It Fl V
Show the version and exit.
.It Fl v
Increase verbosity.
Specify once for synchronisation status, twice to print the name of each file
as it's processed.
If
.Fl f
is given, specify once to print more information about the encapsulated X.509
certificate, twice to print the certificate in PEM format.
.It Fl x
Enable processing of experimental file formats.
This option is implied by
.Fl f .
.It Ar outputdir
The directory where
.Nm
will write the output files.
Defaults to
.Pa /var/db/rpki-client/ .
.El
.Pp
By default
.Nm
outputs validated payloads in
.Fl o
(OpenBGPD compatible) format.
.Pp
.Nm
should be run hourly by
.Xr cron 8 :
use
.Xr crontab 1
to uncomment the entry in root's crontab.
.Sh TRUST ANCHOR CONSTRAINTS
.Nm
can impose locally configured
.Em constraints
on cryptographic products subordinate to publicly-trusted
.Em Trust Anchors .
.Pp
Constraining a Trust Anchor's effective signing authority to a limited set of
.Em Internet Number Resources
allows Relying Parties to take advantage of the potential benefits of
assuming trust, while deriving trust within a bounded scope.
.Pp
Each
.Em .constraints
file imposes constraints on the Trust Anchor reachable via the same-named
.Em .tal
file.
One entry per line.
Entries can be IP prefixes, IP address ranges,
AS identifiers, or AS identifier ranges.
Ranges are a minimum and maximum separated by a hyphen
.Pq Sq - .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
.Em deny
entries may not overlap with other
.Em deny
entries.
.Em allow
entries may not overlap with other
.Em allow
entries.
.Pp
A given EE certificate's resources may not overlap with any
.Em deny
entry, and must be fully contained within the
.Em allow
entries.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables:
.Bl -tag -width "http_proxy"
.It Ev http_proxy
URL of HTTP proxy to use.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/db/rpki-client/openbgpd" -compact
.It Pa /etc/rpki/*.tal
default TAL files used unless
.Fl t Ar tal
is specified.
The TAL files of the five Regional Internet Registries are included.
.It Pa /etc/rpki/*.constraints
files containing registry-specific constraints to restrict what IP addresses
and AS identifiers may or may not appear in EE certificates subordinate to the
same-named Trust Anchor.
.It Pa /etc/rpki/skiplist
default skiplist file, unless
.Fl S Ar skiplist
is specified.
.It Pa /var/cache/rpki-client
cached repository data.
.It Pa /var/db/rpki-client/openbgpd
default roa-set output file.
.It Pa /var/db/rpki-client/rpki.ccr
DER-encoded canonical cache representation file.
This facility is experimental and is still subject to change.
