.Sh NAME
.Nm eigrpctl
.Nd control the EIGRP routing daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl s Ar socket
.Ar command
.Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program controls the
.Xr eigrpd 8
daemon.
Commands may be abbreviated to the minimum unambiguous prefix; for example,
.Cm s i
for
.Cm show interfaces .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s Ar socket
Use
.Ar socket
instead of the default
.Pa /var/run/eigrpd.sock
to communicate with
.Xr eigrpd 8 .
.El
.Pp
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Cm clear neighbors
.Op Cm family Ar family
.Op Cm as Ar as
.Op Ar address
.Xc
Delete entries from the neighbor table.
.Ar family ,
.Ar as ,
and
.Ar address
can be used to limit the scope of the command to the given address family, autonomous system and/or address.
If no argument is given, all neighbors from all EIGRP instances will be deleted.
.It Cm fib couple
Insert the learned routes into the Forwarding Information Base
a.k.a. the kernel routing table.
.It Cm fib decouple
Remove the learned routes from the Forwarding Information Base
a.k.a. the kernel routing table.
Decoupling the FIB from an EIGRP router may create routing loops and could cause
major routing issues in the complete EIGRP cloud.
Only routers with just one link to the EIGRP cloud can safely decouple the FIB.
.It Cm log brief
Disable verbose debug logging.
.It Cm log verbose
Enable verbose debug logging.
.It Cm reload
Reload the configuration file.
.It Xo
.Cm show fib
.Op Cm family Ar family
.Op Ar filter
.Xc
Show the Forwarding Information Base.
.Ar family ,
if given, limit the output to the given address family.
.Ar filter
can be any of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "interfaceXXinterfaceXX" -compact
.It Cm connected
Show only connected routes.
.It Cm interface Op Ar interface
Show only interfaces or the specified
.Ar interface .
.It Cm eigrp
Show only EIGRP routes.
.It Cm static
Show only static routes.
.El
.Pp
.Cm connected ,
.Cm eigrp
and
.Cm static
may be specified together.
.It Xo
.Cm show interfaces
.Op Cm family Ar family
.Op Cm as Ar as
.Op Ar interface
.Xc
Show details for all EIGRP enabled interfaces or the specified
.Ar interface .
.Ar family
and
.Ar as ,
if given, limit the output to the given address family and/or autonomous system.
.It Xo
.Cm show neighbor
.Op Cm family Ar family
.Op Cm as Ar as
.Xc
Show neighbors.
.Ar family
and
.Ar as ,
if given, limit the output to the given address family and/or autonomous system.
.It Xo
.Cm show topology
.Op Cm family Ar family
.Op Cm as Ar as
.Op Ar prefix | filter
.Xc
Show the topology table.
.Ar family
and
.Ar as ,
if given, limit the output to the given address family and/or autonomous system.
.Ar prefix
can be specified to show the entries matching a destination prefix.
.Ar filter
can be any of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "interfaceXXinterfaceXX" -compact
.It Cm active
Show only active entries.
.It Cm all-links
Show all entries.
.El
.It Xo
.Cm show traffic
.Op Cm family Ar family
.Op Cm as Ar as
.Xc
Show traffic statistics.
.Ar family
and
.Ar as ,
if given, limit the output to the given address family and/or autonomous system.
