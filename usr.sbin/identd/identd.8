.It Fl 6

.Nm
to use IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to stderr.
.It Fl e
Always return
.Dq UNKNOWN-ERROR
instead of the
.Dq NO-USER
or
.Dq INVALID-PORT
errors.
.It Fl H
Hide information about existing and non-existent users.
This flag implies
.Fl h .

instead of the normal USERID response.

Always return UID numbers instead of usernames.
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Specifies the idle timeout for client connections,
in seconds.
The default timeout is 120 seconds.
