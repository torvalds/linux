.Dt AUTOMOUNTD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm automountd
.Nd daemon handling autofs mount requests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl D Ar name=value
.Op Fl i
.Op Fl m Ar maxproc
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl v
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon is responsible for handling
.Xr autofs 5
mount requests, parsing maps,
and mounting filesystems they specify.
On startup,
.Nm
forks into background and waits for kernel requests.
When a request is received,
.Nm
forks a child process.
The child process parses the appropriate map and mounts filesystems accordingly.
Then it signals the kernel to release blocked processes that were waiting
for the mount.
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl v"
.It Fl D
Define a variable.
.It Fl i
For indirect mounts, only create subdirectories if there are no wildcard
entries.
Without
.Fl i ,
.Nm
creates all the subdirectories it can.
Users may not realize that the wildcard map entry makes it possible to access
directories that have not yet been created.
.It Fl m Ar maxproc
Limit the number of forked
.Nm
processes, and thus the number of mount requests being handled in parallel.
The default is 30.
.It Fl d
Debug mode: increase verbosity and do not daemonize.
.It Fl o Ar options
Specify mount options.
Options specified here will be overridden by options entered in maps or
.Xr auto_master 5 .
.It Fl v
Increase verbosity.
