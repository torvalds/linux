.Sh NAME
.Nm tcpdrop
.Nd drop a TCP connection
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tcpdrop
.Ar local-addr
.Ar local-port
.Ar remote-addr
.Ar remote-port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command drops the TCP connection specified by the local address
.Ar local-addr ,
port
.Ar local-port
and the foreign address
.Ar remote-addr ,
port
.Ar remote-port .
Addresses and ports can be specified by name or numeric value.
.Pp
To simplify dropping TCP connections using the output of
.Xr fstat 1
and
.Xr netstat 1 ,
.Nm
also supports a two-argument form where the address and port are
separated by a colon
.Pq Sq \&:
or dot
.Pq Sq \&.
character.
.Sh EXAMPLES
If a connection to
.Xr httpd 8
is causing congestion on a network link, one can drop the TCP session
in charge:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ fstat | grep 'httpd.*internet.*<--'
www      httpd      21307    3* internet stream tcp \e
	0xd1007ca8 192.168.5.41:80 <-- 192.168.5.1:26747
.Ed
.Pp
Either of the following commands will drop the connection:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# tcpdrop 192.168.5.41 80 192.168.5.1 26747

# tcpdrop 192.168.5.41:80 192.168.5.1:26747

# tcpdrop 192.168.5.41.80 192.168.5.1.26747
