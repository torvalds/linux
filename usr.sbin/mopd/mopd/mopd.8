.Sh NAME
.Nm mopd
.Nd MOP loader daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mopd
.Op Fl 3 | 4
.Op Fl adfv
.Ar interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
services MOP Load requests on the Ethernet connected to
.Ar interface
or all interfaces if
.Fl a
is given.
In a load request received by
.Nm
a filename can be given.
This is the normal case for, e.g., terminal servers.
If a filename isn't given,
.Nm
must know what image to load.
.Pp
Upon receiving a request,
.Nm
checks if the requested file exists in
.Pa /tftpboot/mop .
The filename is normally all uppercase and with an extension of
.Pa .SYS .
If the filename isn't given, the Ethernet address of the target is used as
filename (e.g.,
.Pa 08002b09f4de.SYS ) ,
and it might be a soft link to another file.
.Pp
.Nm
supports two kinds of files.
The file is first checked to see if it is in a.out format.
If not, a few of Digital's formats are checked.
.Pp
In normal operation,
.Nm
forks a copy of itself and runs in
the background.
Anomalies and errors are reported via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 3
Ignore MOP V3 messages (Ethernet II).
.It Fl 4
Ignore MOP V4 messages (Ethernet 802.3).
.It Fl a
Listen on all the Ethernets attached to the system.
If
.Fl a
is omitted, an interface must be specified.
.It Fl d
Run in debug mode, with all the output to stdout.
The process will run in the foreground.
.It Fl f
Run in the foreground.
.It Fl v
Show version of
.Nm .
