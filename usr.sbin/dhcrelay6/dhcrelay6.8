.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcrelay6
.Nd Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) relay agent
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dlov
.Op Fl E Ar enterprise-number
.Op Fl I Ar interface-id
.Op Fl R Ar remote-id
.Fl i Ar interface
.Ar destination ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides a means for relaying DHCPv6 requests from a subnet to
which no DHCP server is directly connected to one or more DHCPv6 servers
on other subnets.
.Pp
.Nm
listens for DHCPv6 requests on a given interface.
When a query is received,
.Nm
forwards it to the list of DHCP destinations specified on the command
line.
When a reply is received, it is sent on the network from whence the
original request came.
.Pp
The
.Ar destination
might be an address followed by a `%' and an interface name,
or just an interface name (e.g. "2001:db8::1%em0" or "em1").
When no address is specified,
.Nm
will use multicast on the specified interface.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl E Ar enterprise-number
Choose the
.Ar enterprise-number
that will be used by the Remote-ID option (this only has effect when using
.Fl R ) .
.It Fl I Ar interface-id
The
.Ar interface-id
relay agent information option value that
.Nm
should use on relayed packets.
If this option is not specified, it will use the interface name by
default.
.Pp
Avoid using this option when using Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Mode
(layer 2 relay), otherwise
.Nm
will always send replies back to the client interface, which will break
networks with multiple DHCPv6 layer 2 relay agents.
.It Fl i Ar interface
The name of the network interface
which will receive client DHCPv6 requests.
For layer 3 mode at least one IPv6 local, site or global address has to
be configured on this interface.
.It Fl l
Use the Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent mode (layer 2 relaying).
.It Fl o
Add the Interface-ID option.
This option is activated by default when using layer 2 relaying.
.It Fl R Ar remote-id
Enable and add the specified Relay Agent
.Ar remote-id
to identify this relay segment.
.It Fl v
Show verbose messages.
Implies
.Fl d .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Relay multicast packets in the current network to a unicast address
(the relay must have a global address in em0):
.Pp
.Dl # dhcrelay6 -i em0 2001:db8::1000%em0
.Pp
Listen to one subnet and multicast DHCPv6 packets to another
(requires at least link-local addresses):
.Pp
.Dl # dhcrelay6 -i em0 em1
.Pp
Relay DHCPv6 packets with Interface-ID (option 18) using the input
interface as its content:
.Pp
.Dl # dhcrelay6 -o -i em0 2001:db8::1000%em0
.Pp
Same thing as before but with a custom Interface-ID:
.Pp
.Dl # dhcrelay6 -o -I \(dqOpenBSD Router 1\(dq -i em0 2001:db8::1000%em0
.Pp
Use Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent (layer 2 relay) in a bridged or
switched network (no IPv6 address required).
Only makes sense when em0 and em1 are configured in a
.Xr bridge 4 ,
since
.Nm
needs to drop the original DHCPv6 packets and send modified ones with
Interface-ID option.
.Pp
.Dl # dhcrelay6 -l -i em0 em1
.Pp
Identify a segment using Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent (layer 2 relay)
with a Remote-ID (option 37) instead of an Interface-ID:
.Pp
.Dl # dhcrelay6 -l -R \&"OpenBSD Router A\&" -i em0 em1
