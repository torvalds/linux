.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fw_update
.Nd install non-free firmware
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl adFlnv
.Op Fl D Ar path
.Op Fl p Ar path
.Op Ar driver | file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility installs, updates, or deletes firmware for
.Ar driver
from the Internet.
By default,
.Nm
tries to determine which firmware are needed.
.Pp
Since firmware with an acceptable license is already present in
.Ox ,
.Nm
exists purely to deal with firmware that may not be freely
distributed with
.Ox .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Install or update firmware for all drivers.
It is an error to specify this option with any
.Ar driver
arguments.
.It Fl d
Delete firmware for
.Ar driver .
If used without parameters, delete all firmware that is not required by
a driver.
If used in conjunction with
.Fl a ,
delete firmware for all drivers.
.It Fl D Ar path
Use the
.Xr dmesg 8
output from
.Ar path
rather than
.Pa /var/run/dmesg.boot
to determine which firmware are needed.
.It Fl F
Download SHA256.sig and firmware .tgz to the current directory.
.It Fl l
List drivers without installing.
With
.Fl F
lists the full path to the files that will be downloaded.
.It Fl n
Dry run.
Do not actually install or update any firmware;
just report the steps that would be taken.
.It Fl p Ar path
Use
.Ar path ,
either a local directory or a URL,
as the source for firmware instead of the default location.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
This flag can be specified multiple times for increased verbosity.
.El
.Pp
Firmware is downloaded from release-specific directories at
.Lk http://firmware.openbsd.org/firmware/
unless overridden with
.Fl p .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width DESTDIRXXX
.It Ev DESTDIR
The root of the system to install into.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa ${DESTDIR}/usr/share/misc/firmware_patterns
A list of patterns used to detect needed firmware from the
.Xr dmesg 8 .
.It Pa ${DESTDIR}/etc/signify/openbsd-XX-fw.pub
