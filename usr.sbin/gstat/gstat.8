.Nm gstat
.Nd print statistics about GEOM disks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl abBcdops
.Op Fl f Ar filter
.Op Fl I Ar interval
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to monitor I/O transactions of
.Xr geom 4
devices.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Only display providers that are at least 0.1% busy.
.It Fl b
Batch mode.
Collect numbers, print and exit.
Default if stdout is not a tty.
.It Fl B
Endless batch mode.
Same as batch mode, but does not exit after collecting
the first set of data.
.It Fl c
Enable display of
.Xr geom 4
consumers too.
The default is to show statistics only for
.Xr geom 4
producers.
.It Fl C
CSV output mode.
Implies endless batch mode, but output is in the form of comma-separated
values, with ISO 8601-like timestamps.
.It Fl d
Enable display of statistics for delete
.Pq Dv BIO_DELETE
operations.
.It Fl f Ar filter
A regular expression that can be used to only show statistics for some
devices.
Only devices with the names matching
.Ar filter
will be displayed.
The format of the regular expression is described in
.Xr re_format 7 .
.It Fl o
Enable display of statistics for other operations
.Pq Dv BIO_FLUSH .
.It Fl s
Enable blocks' size statistics.
.It Fl I Ar interval
Refresh the
.Nm
display every
.Ar interval
microseconds.
Adding a suffix of
.Cm s , ms ,
or
