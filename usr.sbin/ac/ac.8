.Sh NAME
.Nm ac
.Nd connect time accounting
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ac
.Op Fl dp
.Op Fl t Ar tty
.Op Fl w Ar wtmp
.Op Ar user ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
If the file
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
exists, a record of individual login and logout
times are written to it by
.Xr login 1
and
.Xr init 8 ,
respectively.
.Nm
examines these records and writes the accumulated connect time
for all logins to the standard output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Display the connect times in 24 hour chunks.
.It Fl p
Print individual users' totals.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Only do accounting logins on certain ttys.
The
.Ar tty
specification can start with
.Ql \&!
to indicate not this
.Ar tty
and end with
.Ql *
to indicate all similarly named ttys.
Multiple
.Fl t
flags may be specified.
.It Fl w Ar wtmp
Read connect time data from
.Ar wtmp
instead of the default file,
.Pa /var/log/wtmp .
.It Ar user ...
Display totals for the given individuals only.
.El
.Pp
If no arguments are given,
.Nm
displays the total connect time for all
accounts with login sessions recorded in
.Xr wtmp 5 .
.Pp
The default
.Pa wtmp
file will increase without bound unless it is truncated.
It is normally truncated by
.Xr newsyslog 8 ,
which renames and rotates the
.Pa wtmp
files every week.
In order for
.Nm
to run in sync with the rotation of
.Pa wtmp ,
.Xr newsyslog 8
is configured to run
just after
.Nm
completes.
.Pp
User accounting information can be mailed weekly
to the system administrator:
see
.Xr weekly 8
for more information.
No login or connect time accounting is performed if
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
does not exist.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/log/wtmp.[0-7]XX" -compact
.It Pa /var/log/wtmp
connect time accounting file
.It Pa /var/log/wtmp.[0-7]
rotated files
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std ac
.Sh EXAMPLES
Allow times recorded in
.Pa modems
to be charged out at a different rate than
.Pa other :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ ac -p -t "ttyd*" \*(Gt modems
$ ac -p -t "!ttyd*" \*(Gt other
