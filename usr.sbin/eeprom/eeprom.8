.Sh NAME
.Nm eeprom
.Nd display or modify contents of the OpenPROM
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm eeprom
.Op Fl pv
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Oo
.Ar field Ns Op = Ns Ar value
.Ar ...
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm eeprom
provides an interface for displaying and changing the contents of the
OpenPROM.
Without any arguments,
.Nm eeprom
will list all of the known fields and their corresponding values.
When given the name of a specific field,
.Nm eeprom
will display that value or set it if the field name is followed by
.Sq =
and a value.
Only the superuser may modify the contents of the OpenPROM.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl
Commands are taken from stdin and displayed on stdout.
.It Fl f Ar device
Use
.Ar device
instead of the default
.Pa /dev/openprom .
.It Fl p
Display the tree derived from the OpenPROM and exit.
.It Fl v
Be verbose when setting a value.
.El
.Sh FIELDS AND VALUES
Since the OpenPROM is designed such that the field names are arbitrary,
explaining them here is dubious.
Below are field names and values that one is likely to see.
NOTE: this list
may be incomplete or incorrect due to differences between revisions
of the OpenPROM.
.Bl -tag -width "network-boot-arguments  "
.It Ar sunmon-compat?
If true, the old EEPROM-style interface will be used while in the monitor,
rather than the OpenPROM-style interface.
.It Ar selftest-#megs
A 32-bit integer specifying the number of megabytes of memory to
test upon power-up.
.It Ar oem-logo
A 64bitx64bit bitmap in Sun Iconedit format.
To set the bitmap, give the pathname of the file containing the image.
NOTE: this property is not yet supported.
.It Ar oem-logo?
If true, enables the use of the bitmap stored in
.Ar oem-logo
rather than the default Sun logo.
.It Ar oem-banner
A string to use at power-up, rather than the default Sun banner.
.It Ar oem-banner?
If true, enables the use of the banner stored in
.Ar oem-banner
rather than the default Sun banner.
.It Ar ttya-mode
A string of five comma separated fields in the format
.Dq 9600,8,n,1,- .
The first field is the baud rate.
The second field is the number of data bits.
The third field is the parity; acceptable values for parity are
.Dq n
(none),
.Dq e
(even),
.Dq o
(odd),
.Dq m
(mark), and
.Dq s
(space).
The fourth field is the number of stop bits.
The fifth field is the
.Dq handshake
field; acceptable values are
.Dq -
(none),
.Dq h
(RTS/CTS), and
.Dq s
(XON/XOFF).
.It Ar ttya-rts-dtr-off
If true, the system will ignore RTS/DTR.
.It Ar ttya-ignore-cd
If true, the system will ignore carrier detect.
.It Ar ttyb-mode
Similar to
.Ar ttya-mode ,
but for ttyb.
.It Ar ttyb-rts-dtr-off
Similar to
.Ar ttya-rts-dtr-off ,
but for ttyb.
.It Ar ttyb-ignore-cd
Similar to
.Ar ttya-ignore-cd ,
but for ttyb.
.It Ar sbus-probe-list
Four digits in the format
.Dq 0123
specifying which order to probe the SBus at power-up.
It is unlikely that this value should ever be changed.
.It Ar screen-#columns
An 8-bit integer specifying the number of columns on the console.
.It Ar screen-#rows
An 8-bit integer specifying the number of rows on the console.
.It Ar boot-device
Space separated list of device aliases or device paths to boot from,
in the given order.
.It Ar boot-file
File to boot.
The empty string lets the second-stage boot program
.Sy ofwboot
choose the default.
.It Ar auto-boot?
If true, the system will boot automatically at power-up.
.It Ar watchdog-reboot?
If true, the system will reboot upon reset.
Otherwise, the system will fall into the monitor.
.It Ar input-device
One of the strings
.Dq keyboard ,
.Dq ttya ,
or
.Dq ttyb
specifying the default console input device.
.It Ar output-device
One of the strings
.Dq screen ,
.Dq ttya ,
or
.Dq ttyb
specifying the default console output device.
.It Ar keyboard-click?
If true, the keys click annoyingly.
.It Ar network-boot-arguments
Comma separated list of arguments for booting over RARP or BOOTP/DHCP and TFTP.
.It Ar sd-targets
A string in the format
.Dq 31204567
describing the translation of physical to logical target.
.It Ar st-targets
Similar to
.Ar sd-targets ,
but for tapes.
The default translation is
.Dq 45670123 .
.It Ar scsi-initiator-id
The SCSI ID of the on-board SCSI controller.
.It Ar hardware-revision
A 7-character string describing a date, such as
.Dq 25May95 .
.It Ar last-hardware-update
Similar to
.Ar hardware-revision ,
describing when the CPU was last updated.
.It Ar diag-switch?
If true, the system will boot and run in diagnostic mode.
.It Ar local-mac-address?
When set to
.Em false ,
all Ethernet devices will use the same system default MAC address.
When
.Em true ,
Ethernet devices which have a unique MAC address will use it
rather than the system default MAC address.
This option only really affects FCode-based Ethernet devices.
On Sparc64, all on-board devices,
as well as plug-in
.Xr hme 4
boards, will respect this setting;
other hardware will not.

.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/dev/openprom" -compact
.It /dev/openprom

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr openprom 4
.Sh CAVEATS
The fields and their values are not necessarily well defined on
systems with an OpenPROM.
Your mileage may vary.
.Pp
There are a few fields known to exist in some revisions of the
OpenPROM that are not yet supported.
Most notable are those
relating to password protection of the OpenPROM.
.Pp
The date parser isn't very intelligent.
