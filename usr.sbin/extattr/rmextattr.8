.Sh DESCRIPTION
These
utilities
are user tools to manipulate the named extended attributes on files and
directories.
The
.Ar attrnamespace
argument should be the namespace of the attribute to retrieve: legal
values are
.Cm user
and
.Cm system .
The
.Ar attrname
argument should be the name of the attribute,
.Ar filename
the name of the target file or directory,
.Ar attrvalue
a string to store in the attribute.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
(Force.)
Ignore errors on individual filenames and continue with
the remaining arguments.
.It Fl h
(No follow.)
If the file is a symbolic link, perform the operation on the
link itself rather than the file that the link points to.
.It Fl i
(From stdin.)
Read attribute data from stdin instead of as an argument.
.It Fl n
.Dv ( NUL Ns
-terminate.)
.Dv NUL Ns
-terminate the extent content written out.
.It Fl q
(Quiet.)
Do not print out the pathname and suppress error messages.
When given twice, print only the attribute value, with no trailing newline.
.It Fl s
(Stringify.)
Escape nonprinting characters and put quotes around the output.
.It Fl x
(Hex.)
Print the output in hexadecimal.
