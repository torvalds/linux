.Dt RPC.LOCKD 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rpc.lockd
.Nd NFS file locking daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rpc.lockd
.Op Fl d Op Ar debug_level
.Op Fl g Ar grace_period
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm rpc.lockd
is a daemon which provides file- and record-locking services in an NFS
environment.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Op Ar debug_level
Write debugging information to syslog, recording
all RPC transactions to the daemon.
These messages are logged with level
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
and facility
.Dv LOG_DAEMON .
If
.Ar debug_level
is not specified,
level 1 is assumed, giving one log line per protocol operation.
Higher debug levels can be specified, causing display of operation arguments
and internal operations of the daemon.
.It Fl g Ar grace_period
Specify the grace period, in seconds.
During the grace period
.Nm
only accepts requests from hosts which are reinitialising locks which
existed before the server restart.
The default is 30 seconds.
.El
.Pp
Error conditions are logged to syslog, irrespective of the debug level,
using log level
.Dv LOG_ERR
and facility
.Dv LOG_DAEMON .
.Pp
The
.Nm rpc.lockd
daemon must NOT be invoked by
.Xr inetd 8
because the protocol assumes that the daemon will run from system start time.
Instead, it should be run from
.Xr rc 8
after the network has been started.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/include/rpcsvc/nlm_prot.x -compact
.It Pa /usr/include/rpcsvc/nlm_prot.x
RPC protocol specification for the network lock manager protocol.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr syslog 3 ,
.Xr rc 8
.Sh STANDARDS
The implementation is based on the specification in X/Open CAE Specification
C218, "Protocols for X/Open PC Interworking: XNFS, Issue 4", ISBN 1 872630 66 9
.Sh BUGS
The current implementation provides only the server side of the protocol
(i.e., clients running other OS types can establish locks on an
.Ox
fileserver,
but there is currently no means for an
.Ox
client to establish locks).
.Pp
The current implementation serialises lock requests that could be shared.
