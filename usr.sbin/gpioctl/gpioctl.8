.Op flag ...
.Nm
.Op Fl f Ar ctldev
.Op Fl pN
.Cm -n
.Ar pin
.Ar pin-name
.Nm
.Op Cm -f Ar ctldev
.Op Fl pN
.Ar pin
.Ar [0|1]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility could be used to manage GPIO pins from userland and list available pins.
.Pp
The
.Pa pin
argument can either be a
.Pa pin-number
or a
.Pa pin-name .
If it is a number and a pin has this number as its name and you did not use
.Fl N
or
.Fl p
, then
.Nm
exits.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl f Ar ctldev"
.It Fl c Ar pin Ar flag Op flag ...
Configure pin by setting provided flags.
The following flags are currently defined:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width ".Cm PULSE"
.It Cm IN
Input pin
.It Cm OUT
Output pin
.It Cm OD
Open drain pin
.It Cm PP
Push pull pin
.It Cm TS
Tristate pin
.It Cm PU
Pull-up pin
.It Cm PD
Pull-down pin
.It Cm II
Inverted input pin
.It Cm IO
Inverted output pin
.El
.It Fl f Ar ctldev
GPIO controller device to use
If not specified, defaults to
.Pa /dev/gpioc0
.It Fl l
list available pins
.It Fl n Ar pin Ar pin-name
set the name used to describe the pin
.It Fl t Ar pin
toggle value of provided pin
.It Fl v
be verbose: for each listed pin print current configuration
.It Fl p
Force
.Pa pin
to be interpreted as a pin number
.It Fl N
Force
.Pa pin
to be interpreted as a pin name
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -bullet
.It
List pins available on GPIO controller defined by device /dev/gpioc0
.Pp
gpioctl -f /dev/gpioc0 -l
.It
Set the value of pin 12 to 1
.Pp
gpioctl -f /dev/gpioc0 12 1
.It
Configure pin 12 to be input pin
.Pp
gpioctl -f /dev/gpioc0 -c 12 IN
.It
Set the name of pin 12 to test
.Pp
gpioctl -f /dev/gpioc0 -n 12 test
.It
Toggle the value the pin named test
.Pp
gpioctl -f /dev/gpioc0 -t test
.It
Toggle the value of pin number 12 even if another pin has the name 12
.Pp
gpioctl -f /dev/gpioc0 -pt 12
