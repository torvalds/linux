.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a quota editor.
By default, or if the
.Fl u
flag is specified,
one or more users may be specified on the command line.
For each user a temporary file is created
with an
.Tn ASCII
representation of the current
disk quotas for that user.
The list of file systems with user quotas is determined from
.Pa /etc/fstab .
An editor is invoked on the
.Tn ASCII
file.
The editor invoked is
.Xr vi 1
unless the environment variable
.Ev EDITOR
specifies otherwise.
.Pp
The quotas may then be modified, new quotas added, etc.
Block quotas can be specified in bytes (B), kilobytes (K),
megabytes (M), terabytes (T), petabytes (P), or exabytes (E).
If no units are specified, kilobytes are assumed.
Inode quotas can be specified in kiloinodes (K),
megainodes (M), terainodes (T), petainodes (P), or exainodes (E).
If no units are specified, the number of inodes specified are used.
If the
.Fl h
flag is specified, the editor will always display the
block usage and limits in a more human readable format
rather than displaying them in the historic kilobyte format.
Setting a quota to zero indicates that no quota should be imposed.
Setting a hard limit to one indicates that no allocations should
be permitted.
Setting a soft limit to one with a hard limit of zero
indicates that allocations should be permitted only on
a temporary basis (see
.Fl t
below).
The current usage information in the file is for informational purposes;
only the hard and soft limits can be changed.
.Pp
On leaving the editor,
.Nm
reads the temporary file and modifies the binary
quota files to reflect the changes made.
.Pp
If the
.Fl p
option is specified,
.Nm
will duplicate the quotas of the prototypical user
specified for each user specified.
This is the normal mechanism used to
initialize quotas for groups of users.
If the user given to assign quotas to is a numerical uid
range (e.g.\& 1000-2000), then
.Nm
will duplicate the quotas of the prototypical user
for each uid in the range specified.
This allows
for easy setup of default quotas for a group of users.
The uids in question do not have to be currently assigned in
.Pa /etc/passwd .
.Pp
If one or more
.Fl e
.Sm off
.Ar fspath Op : Ar bslim Op : Ar bhlim Op : Ar islim Op : Ar ihlim
.Sm on
options are specified,
.Nm
will non-interactively set quotas defined by
.Ar bslim , bhlim , islim ,
and
.Ar ihlim
on each particular file system referenced by
.Ar fspath .
Here
.Ar bslim
is the soft limit on the number of blocks,
.Ar bhlim
is the hard limit on the number of blocks,
.Ar islim
is the soft limit on the number of files, and
.Ar ihlim
is the hard limit on the number of files.
If any of the
.Ar bslim , bhlim , islim ,
and
.Ar ihlim
values is omitted, it is assumed to be zero, therefore
indicating that no particular quota should be imposed.
Block quotas can be specified in bytes (B), kilobytes (K),
megabytes (M), terabytes (T), petabytes (P), or exabytes (E).
If no units are specified, kilobytes are assumed.
Inode quotas can be specified in kiloinodes (K),
megainodes (M), terainodes (T), petainodes (P), or exainodes (E).
If no units are specified, the number of inodes specified are used.
.Pp
If invoked with the
.Fl f
option,
.Nm
will read and modify quotas on the file system specified by
.Ar fspath
only.
The
.Ar fspath
argument may be either a special device
or a file system mount point.
The primary purpose of this option is to set the scope for the
.Fl p
option, which would overwrite quota records on every
file system with quotas otherwise.
.Pp
If the
.Fl g
flag is specified,
.Nm
is invoked to edit the quotas of
one or more groups specified on the command line.
The
.Fl p
flag can be specified in conjunction with
the
.Fl g
flag to specify a prototypical group
to be duplicated among the listed set of groups.
Similarly,
.Fl e
flag can be specified in conjunction with
the
.Fl g
flag to non-interactively set-up quotas on the listed set
of groups.
.Pp
Users are permitted to exceed their soft limits
for a grace period that may be specified per file system.
Once the grace period has expired,
the soft limit is enforced as a hard limit.
The default grace period for a file system is specified in
.In ufs/ufs/quota.h .
The
.Fl t
flag can be used to change the grace period.
By default, or when invoked with the
.Fl u
flag,
the grace period is set for all the file systems with user
quotas specified in
.Pa /etc/fstab .
When invoked with the
.Fl g
flag the grace period is
set for all the file systems with group quotas specified in
.Pa /etc/fstab .
The grace period may be specified in days, hours, minutes, or seconds.
Setting a grace period to zero indicates that the default
grace period should be imposed.
Setting a grace period to one second indicates that no
grace period should be granted.
Quotas must be turned off for the file system and
then turned back on for the new grace period to take effect.
.Pp
Only the super-user may edit quotas.
