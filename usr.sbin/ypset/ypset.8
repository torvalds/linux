.Sh NAME
.Nm ypset
.Nd tell
.Xr ypbind 8
which NIS server process to use
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl d Ar domain
.Ar server
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility tells the
.Xr ypbind 8
process on the current machine which NIS server process to communicate with.
If
.Ar server
is down or is not running a NIS server process, it is not discovered until
a NIS client process attempts to access a NIS map, at which time
.Xr ypbind 8
tests the binding and takes appropriate action.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
is most useful for binding a NIS client that is not on the same broadcast
network as the closest NIS server, but can also be used for debugging
a local network's NIS configuration, testing specific NIS client
programs, or binding to a specific server when there are many servers on
the local network supplying NIS maps.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d Ar domain
Use the NIS domain
.Ar domain
instead of the default domain as returned by
.Xr domainname 1 .
.It Fl h Ar host
Set the NIS binding on
.Ar host
instead of the local machine.
