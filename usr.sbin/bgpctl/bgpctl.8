.Sh NAME
.Nm bgpctl
.Nd control the BGP routing daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm bgpctl
.Op Fl jnV
.Op Fl s Ar socket
.Ar command
.Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program controls the
.Xr bgpd 8
daemon.
Commands may be abbreviated to the minimum unambiguous prefix; for example,
.Cm s su
for
.Cm show summary .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl j
Create output as JSON object.
.It Fl n
Show neighbors' IP addresses instead of their description.
.It Fl s Ar socket
Use
.Ar socket
to communicate with
.Xr bgpd 8
instead of the default
.Pa /var/run/bgpd.sock.<rdomain>
where
.Ar <rdomain>
is the routing domain
.Nm
is running in.
To administer
.Xr bgpd 8
in a different routing domain, run
.Nm
in said routing domain.
.It Fl V
Show the version and exit.
.El
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx
.It Xo
.Cm fib
.Op Cm table Ar number
.Cm couple
.Xc
Insert the learned routes into the specified Forwarding Information Base
a.k.a. the kernel routing table.
.It Xo
.Cm fib
.Op Cm table Ar number
.Cm decouple
.Xc
Remove the learned routes from the specified Forwarding Information Base
a.k.a. the kernel routing table.
.It Cm flowspec add Ar family rule Op Cm set Ar argument ...
Add the specified flowspec rule to the list of announced rules.
Currently
.Ar family
can be either
.Cm inet
or
.Cm inet6 .
It is possible to set various path attributes with additional arguments.
Adding a rule will replace an existing equal rule, including rules loaded
from the configuration.
See
.Xr bgpd.conf 5
for information on how to write a flowspec rule.
.It Cm flowspec delete Ar family rule
Remove the specified flowspec rule from the list of announced rules.
.It Cm flowspec flush
Remove all dynamically added (i.e. with
.Nm Cm flowspec add )
flowspec rules from the list of announced rules.
.It Cm flowspec show Ar family
Show all announced flowspec rules.
.Ar family ,
if given, limits the output to the given address family.
The supported families are
.Em inet
and
.Em inet6 .
.It Cm log brief
Disable verbose debug logging.
.It Cm log verbose
Enable verbose debug logging.
.It Cm neighbor Ar peer Cm clear Op Ar reason
Stop and restart the BGP session to the specified neighbor.
If a
.Ar reason

is sent as Administrative Shutdown Communication to the neighbor.
.Ar peer
may be the neighbor's address, description or the word
.Cm group
followed by a group description.
.It Cm neighbor Ar peer Cm destroy
Destroy a previously cloned peer.
The peer must be down before calling this function.
.Ar peer
may be the neighbor's address, description or the word
.Cm group
followed by a group description.
.It Cm neighbor Ar peer Cm down Op Ar reason
Take the BGP session to the specified neighbor down.
If a

.Cm group
followed by a group description.
.It Cm neighbor Ar peer Cm refresh

Note that the neighbor is not obliged to re-send all routes, or any routes at
all, even if it announced the route refresh capability.
.Ar peer
may be the neighbor's address, description or the word
.Cm group
followed by a group description.
.It Cm neighbor Ar peer Cm up

It is possible to set various path attributes with additional arguments.
Adding a prefix will replace an existing equal prefix, including
prefixes loaded from the configuration.
.It Xo

.Op Ar argument ...
.Xc
Bulk add specified prefixes to the list of announced networks.
Prefixes should be sent via stdin.
