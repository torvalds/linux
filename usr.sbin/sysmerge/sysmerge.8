.Sh NAME
.Nm sysmerge
.Nd update system configuration files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Bk -words
.Op Fl bdp
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility designed to help the administrator update configuration files
after upgrading to a new release or snapshot.
.Pp
.Nm
works by comparing a reference root directory against currently installed files.
.Pp
.Nm
will work through the fileset,
offering the chance to merge any differences using
.Xr sdiff 1 .
Merged files may be edited using the default editor or be left to deal
with at a later date.
Should any problems occur,
such as a failure to upgrade a file,
the user will be notified and will have to deal with the issue by hand.
.Pp
By default (if
.Fl d
is not used)
.Nm
only compares files whose reference sources have changed since the last run
and attempts to automatically upgrade them to the newest version,
provided that they have no local changes.
It automatically installs missing files and binaries,
and updates files differing only by CVS Id.
Files whose reference sources have matching CVS Id are skipped from comparison.
.Pa /etc/fbtab
and
.Pa /etc/ttys
are created using helper scripts and are
.Sy always
compared.
Users and groups that are missing from the current installation but
present in the new
.Xr master.passwd 5
and
.Xr group 5
files will
.Sy always
be automatically (re)created.
.Pp
.Nm
will finish by running
.Xr mtree 8
to make sure the directory structure has correct permissions.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Batch mode.
.Nm
runs non-interactively,
saving differing files for later manual processing.
.It Fl d
Diff mode.
.Nm
does not take any automatic action, allowing for a full diff comparison.
.It Fl p
Package mode.
.Nm
only compares the default configuration files of installed
.Xr packages 7
against their target on the system (@sample).
.El
.Pp
Files can be excluded from comparison by listing them in
.Pa /etc/sysmerge.ignore .
Checksum files stored under
.Pa /var/sysmerge
as well as the following files will always be skipped from direct comparison:
.Pa /etc/group ,
.Pa /etc/localtime ,
.Pa /etc/master.passwd ,
.Pa /etc/motd ,
.Pa /etc/passwd ,
.Pa /etc/pwd.db ,
.Pa /etc/spwd.db ,
.Pa /var/db/locate.database ,
.Pa /var/mail/root .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "EDITORXXVISUAL"
.It Ev EDITOR , VISUAL
Specifies an editor to use.
If both
.Ev EDITOR
and
.Ev VISUAL
are set,
.Ev VISUAL
takes precedence.
If neither
.Ev EDITOR
nor
.Ev VISUAL
are set,
the default is
.Xr vi 1 .
.It Ev PAGER
Specifies the pagination program to use.
If
.Ev PAGER
is empty or not set,
.Xr more 1
will be used.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/sysmerge/xetc.tgz" -compact
.It Pa /etc/sysmerge.ignore
Files and directories to ignore from comparison.
.It Pa /var/sysmerge/backups
Directory containing backup of
.Nm
last run modified files.
Rotated automatically in order of increasing age from
.Pa backups.0
to
.Pa backups.3 .
.It Pa /var/sysmerge/etc.tgz
Base system set containing the reference files
corresponding to the currently installed release.
.It Pa /var/sysmerge/xetc.tgz
.Xr X 7
set containing the reference files
corresponding to the currently installed release.
