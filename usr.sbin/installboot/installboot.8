.Sh NAME
.Nm installboot
.Nd install bootstrap on a disk
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm installboot
.Op Fl cnv
.Op Fl r Ar root
.Ar disk
.Op Ar stage1 Op Ar stage2
.Nm
.Op Fl nv
.Fl p
.Ar disk
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
installs bootstrap on the specified disk.
The exact process used depends on the system architecture, however there is
generally a primary bootstrap (often known as a boot block) and a
secondary bootstrap (often known as a boot loader).
Some architectures only require a single stage bootstrap, which is written to
the beginning of the disk.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Set up the machine to boot from the specified disk by default.
This is only implemented for amd64 and arm64 machines with UEFI
firmware and GPT partition tables.
.It Fl n
Perform a dry run - do not actually write to the disk.
.It Fl p
Prepare filesystem.
This will create a new filesystem on the partition reserved for the
boot loader on architectures that require one.
.It Fl r Ar root
Specify the mount point of the
.Ar root
filesystem to operate on, defaulting to
.Ar / .
.It Fl v
Increase verbosity during operation.
.It Ar disk
Specify the
.Ar disk
to install the bootstrap on.
This may be specified using a full pathname, an abbreviated disk form,
or a disklabel UID.
.It Ar stage1
Specify the file to use for the primary bootstrap.
If not specified, the default for this architecture will be used.
.It Ar stage2
Specify the file to use for the secondary bootstrap.
If not specified, the default for this architecture will be used.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
In its most basic form, to install bootstrap on
.Ar disk
sd0, using the default primary and secondary bootstrap files:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
# installboot sd0
.Ed
.Pp
To install bootstrap on an
.Ox
amd64 machine, using
.Ar /usr/mdec/biosboot
as the primary bootstrap and
.Ar /usr/mdec/boot
as the secondary bootstrap:
.Bd -literal -offset 3n
# installboot -v wd0 /usr/mdec/biosboot /usr/mdec/boot
.Ed
