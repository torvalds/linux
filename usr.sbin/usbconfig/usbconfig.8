.Sh NAME
.Nm usbconfig
.Nd configure the USB subsystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl u Ar unit
.Op Fl a Ar addr
.Op cmds...
.Nm
.Op Oo Fl d Oc Ar [ugen]<unit>.<addr>
.Op cmds...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to configure and dump information about the USB subsystem.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "        "
.It Fl u Ar unit
Limit device range to USB devices connected to the given USBUS unit.
.It Fl a Ar addr
Limit device range to the given USB device index.
Should only be used in conjunction with the unit argument.
.It Fl d Ar [ugen]<unit>.<addr>
Limit device range to USB devices connected to the given unit and address.
The unit and address coordinates may be prefixed by the lowercased word "ugen".
.It Fl h
Show help and available commands.
.El
.Pp
The following commands may be used with
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm set_config Ar cfg_index
Choose the configuration for the USB device.
Valid values range from zero to the number reported as the
.Ar bNumConfigurations
in
.Cm dump_device_desc
output.
The special value of 255 unconfigures the device, detaching
the interface drivers and reducing the power consumption to minimum,
but without going into power saving mode or detaching from the bus.
In some cases, it prevents the device from charging.
.It Cm set_alt Ar alt_index
Choose the alternate interface for the USB device.
Alternative settings for the current configuration are available as the
.Ar bAlternateSetting
in
.Cm dump_curr_config_desc
output.
Usually there is no need to adjust this setting.
.It Cm set_template Ar template
Set the global USB device side template.
See
.Xr usb_template 4
for more information.
.It Cm get_template
Get the current USB device side template.
.It Cm add_dev_quirk_vplh Ar vid Ar pid Ar lo_rev Ar hi_rev Ar quirk_name
Add a quirk by specifying the Vendor ID, Product ID, low and high
revision numbers, and the quirk name.
See
.Xr usb_quirk 4
for more information.
.It Cm remove_dev_quirk_vplh Ar vid Ar pid Ar lo_rev Ar hi_rev Ar quirk_name
Remove a quirk.
.It Cm add_quirk Ar quirk_name
Add quirk for the currently selected USB device.
.It Cm remove_quirk Ar quirk_name
Remove a quirk for the currently selected USB device.
.It Cm dump_all_desc
Display the device and configuration descriptors.
.It Cm dump_quirk_names
Display the list of supported quirk names.
.It Cm dump_device_quirks
Display the list of current device quirks.
.It Cm dump_device_desc
Display the device descriptor.
.It Cm dump_curr_config_desc
Display current configuration descriptor.
.It Cm dump_all_config_desc
Display all the configuration descriptors.
.It Cm dump_string Ar index
Display string descriptor at selected index.
.It Cm dump_info
Display summary information about the device.
.It Cm show_ifdrv
Display the list of interface drivers (such as
.Xr ukbd 4
or
.Xr u3g 4 )
currently attached to the device.
.It Cm suspend
Force the device to suspend.
.It Cm resume
Force the device to resume.
.It Cm power_off
Turn the device off.
.It Cm power_save
Turn the automatic suspend and resume on.
This is the default for USB hubs.
.It Cm power_on
Turn the device on and disable automatic suspend and resume.
This is the default for non-hub devices.
.It Cm reset
Reset the device.
This forces the USB stack to reenumerate the bus.
.It Cm list
List all available USB devices.
This is the default if
.Nm
is called without specifying a command.
.It Cm do_request Ar bmReqTyp Ar bReq Ar wVal Ar wIdx Ar wLen Ar data...
Perform a synchronous control request on the specified device.
See
.Xr libusb20_dev_request_sync 3
for more information.
