.Sh NAME
.Nm portmap
.Nd Internet protocol port to RPC program number mapper
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm portmap
.Op Fl d
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm portmap
is a server that converts RPC program numbers into Internet
protocol port numbers.
It must be running in order to make RPC calls.
.Pp
When an RPC server is started, it will tell
.Nm portmap
what port number it is listening to, and what RPC
program numbers it is prepared to serve.
When a client wishes to make an RPC
call to a given program number,
it will first contact
.Nm portmap
on the server machine to determine
the port number where RPC packets should be sent.
.Pp
.Nm portmap
must be started before any RPC servers are invoked.
.Pp
Normally
.Nm portmap
forks and dissociates itself from the terminal
like any other daemon.
.Nm portmap
then logs errors using
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
(debug) prevents
.Nm portmap
from running as a daemon,
and causes errors and debugging information
to be printed to the standard error output.

.Xr rpcinfo 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
