.Sh NAME
.Nm mld6query
.Nd send multicast listener query
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dgr
.Ar intface
.Op Ar maddr
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sends an IPv6 multicast listener discovery (MLD) query packet toward
the specified multicast address,
.Ar maddr ,
toward interface
.Ar intface .
If you omit
.Ar maddr ,
linklocal all nodes multicast address(ff02::1) is used.
.Pp
After sending a query,
.Nm
waits for replies for at most 10 seconds.
If a reply is returned,
.Nm
prints it with its type and then waits for another reply.
.Pp
This program is provided only for debugging.
It is not necessary for normal use.
.Pp
With
.Fl g ,
.Nm
will transmit a General Query instead of the default Multicast-Address-Specific Query.
With
.Fl d ,
.Nm
will transmit MLD done packet instead of MLD query packet.
With
.Fl r ,
similarly, MLD report packet will be transmitted.
.Fl dr
options are for debugging purposes only.
.\"
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The program exits with 0 on success, non-zero on failures.
.\"
.\" .Sh SEE ALSO
.\"
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility does not take care of multicast addresses which have non link-local
scope.
