.Sh NAME
.Nm arp
.Nd address resolution display and control
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm arp
.Op Fl adn
.Op Fl V Ar rdomain
.Ar hostname
.Nm arp
.Op Fl F
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl V Ar rdomain
.Fl s Ar hostname ether_addr
.Op Cm temp | permanent
.Op Cm pub
.Nm
.Fl W Ar ether_addr Op Ar iface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program displays and modifies the Internet-to-Ethernet address translation
tables used by the address resolution protocol (ARP).
.Pp
.Nm
displays the current ARP entry for
.Ar hostname
when no optional parameters are supplied.
.Ar hostname
may be specified by name or by number,
using Internet dot notation.
.Pp
.Nm
can also be used to send Wake on LAN (WoL) frames over a local
Ethernet network to one or more hosts using their link layer (hardware)
addresses.
WoL functionality is generally enabled in a machine's BIOS
and can be used to power on machines from a remote system without
having physical access to them.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Display all of the current ARP entries.
See also the
.Fl d
option below.
The following information will be printed:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset 3n
.It Host
The network address of the host.
.It Ethernet Address
The Ethernet address of the host.
If the address is not available,
it will be displayed as
.Dq (incomplete) .
.It Netif
The network interface associated with the ARP entry.
.It Expire
The time until expiry of the entry.
If the entry is marked
.Dq permanent
or
.Dq static ,
it will never expire.
.It Flags
Flags on the ARP entry, in a single letter.
They are: local
.Pq Sq l
and published
.Pq Sq p .
.El
.It Fl d
Delete an entry for the host called
.Ar hostname .
Alternatively, the
.Fl d
flag may be combined with the
.Fl a
flag to delete all entries, with hostname lookups automatically
disabled.
Only the superuser may delete entries.
.It Fl F
Force existing entries for the given host to be overwritten
(only relevant to the
.Fl f
and
.Fl s
options).
.It Fl f Ar file
Process entries from
.Ar file
to be set in the ARP tables.
See the
.Fl s
option for a description of the file format and the effect of the
.Fl F
option.
.It Fl n
Do not perform domain name resolution.
If a name cannot be resolved without DNS, an error will be reported.
.It Xo
.Fl s Ar hostname ether_addr
.Op Cm temp | permanent
.Op Cm pub
.Xc
Create an ARP entry for the host called
.Ar hostname
with the Ethernet address
.Ar ether_addr .
The Ethernet address is given as six hexadecimal bytes separated by
colons.
The entry will be static (will not time out) unless the word
.Cm temp
is given in the command.
A static ARP entry can be overwritten by network traffic, unless the word
.Cm permanent
is given.
If the word
.Cm pub
is given, the entry will be
.Dq published ;
that is, this system will act as an ARP server,
responding to requests for
.Ar hostname
even though the host address is not its own.
This behavior has traditionally been called
.Em proxy ARP .
.Pp
If the entry already exists for the given host, it will not
be replaced unless
.Fl F
is given.
.It Fl V Ar rdomain
Select the routing domain.
.It Fl W Ar ether_addr Op Ar iface
Send the Wake on LAN frame from all interfaces on the local machine
that are up, if
.Ar iface
has not been specified.
Otherwise the frame will be sent from
.Ar iface .
.Ar ether_addr
is the Ethernet address of the remote machine or a hostname entry in
.Pa /etc/ethers .
This option cannot be used in combination with any other option.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/ethers" -compact
.It Pa /etc/ethers
Ethernet host name database.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
View the current
.Xr arp 4
table,
showing network addresses symbolically:
.Pp
.Dl $ arp -a
.Pp
Create a permanent
entry (one that cannot be overwritten by other network traffic):
.Pp
.Dl # arp -s 10.0.0.2 00:90:27:bb:cc:dd permanent
.Pp
Create proxy ARP
entries on interface fxp0
(MAC address 00:90:27:bb:cc:dd),
for IP addresses 204.1.2.3 and 204.1.2.4:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# arp -s 204.1.2.3 00:90:27:bb:cc:dd pub
# arp -s 204.1.2.4 00:90:27:bb:cc:dd pub

command appeared in

Wake on LAN functionality was added in
