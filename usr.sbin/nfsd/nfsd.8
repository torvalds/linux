.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ardute
.Op Fl n Ar num_servers
.Op Fl h Ar bindip
.Op Fl p Ar pnfs_setup
.Op Fl m Ar mirror_level
.Op Fl V Ar virtual_hostname
.Op Fl Fl maxthreads Ar max_threads
.Op Fl Fl minthreads Ar min_threads
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility runs on a server machine to service
.Tn NFS
requests from client machines.
At least one
.Nm
must be running for a machine to operate as a server.
.Pp
Unless otherwise specified, eight servers per CPU for
.Tn UDP
transport are started.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl r
Register the
.Tn NFS
service with
.Xr rpcbind 8
without creating any servers.
This option can be used along with the
.Fl u
or
.Fl t
options to re-register NFS if the rpcbind server is restarted.
.It Fl d
Unregister the
.Tn NFS
service with
.Xr rpcbind 8
without creating any servers.
.It Fl V Ar virtual_hostname
Specifies a hostname to be used as a principal name, instead of
the default hostname.
.It Fl n Ar threads
Specifies how many servers to create.  This option is equivalent to specifying
.Fl Fl maxthreads
and
.Fl Fl minthreads
with their respective arguments to
.Ar threads .
.It Fl Fl maxthreads Ar threads
Specifies the maximum servers that will be kept around to service requests.
.It Fl Fl minthreads Ar threads
Specifies the minimum servers that will be kept around to service requests.
.It Fl h Ar bindip
Specifies which IP address or hostname to bind to on the local host.
This option is recommended when a host has multiple interfaces.
Multiple
.Fl h
options may be specified.
.It Fl a
Specifies that nfsd should bind to the wildcard IP address.
This is the default if no
.Fl h
options are given.
It may also be specified in addition to any
.Fl h
options given.
Note that NFS/UDP does not operate properly when
bound to the wildcard IP address whether you use -a or do not use -h.
.It Fl p Ar pnfs_setup
Enables pNFS support in the server and specifies the information that the
daemon needs to start it.
This option can only be used on one server and specifies that this server
will be the MetaData Server (MDS) for the pNFS service.
This can only be done if there is at least one FreeBSD system configured
as a Data Server (DS) for it to use.
.Pp
The
.Ar pnfs_setup
string is a set of fields separated by ',' characters:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
Each of these fields specifies one DS.
It consists of a server hostname, followed by a ':'
and the directory path where the DS's data storage file system is mounted on
this MDS server.
This can optionally be followed by a '#' and the mds_path, which is the
directory path for an exported file system on this MDS.
If this is specified, it means that this DS is to be used to store data
files for this mds_path file system only.
If this optional component does not exist, the DS will be used to store data
files for all exported MDS file systems.
The DS storage file systems must be mounted on this system before the
.Nm
is started with this option specified.
.br
For example:
.sp
nfsv4-data0:/data0,nfsv4-data1:/data1
.sp
would specify two DS servers called nfsv4-data0 and nfsv4-data1 that comprise
the data storage component of the pNFS service.
These two DSs would be used to store data files for all exported file systems
on this MDS.
The directories
.Dq /data0
and
.Dq /data1
are where the data storage servers exported
storage directories are mounted on this system (which will act as the MDS).
.br
Whereas, for the example:
.sp
nfsv4-data0:/data0#/export1,nfsv4-data1:/data1#/export2
.sp
would specify two DSs as above, however nfsv4-data0 will be used to store
data files for
.Dq /export1
and nfsv4-data1 will be used to store data files for
.Dq /export2 .
.El
.sp
When using IPv6 addresses for DSs
be wary of using link local addresses.
The IPv6 address for the DS is sent to the client and there is no scope
zone in it.
As such, a link local address may not work for a pNFS client to DS
TCP connection.
When parsed,
.Nm
will only use a link local address if it is the only address returned by
.Xr getaddrinfo 3
for the DS hostname.
.It Fl m Ar mirror_level
This option is only meaningful when used with the
.Fl p
option.
It specifies the
.Dq mirror_level ,
which defines how many of the DSs will
have a copy of a file's data storage file.
The default of one implies no mirroring of data storage files on the DSs.
The
.Dq mirror_level
would normally be set to 2 to enable mirroring, but
can be as high as NFSDEV_MAXMIRRORS.
There must be at least
.Dq mirror_level
DSs for each exported file system on the MDS, as specified in the
.Fl p
option.
This implies that, for the above example using "#/export1" and "#/export2",
mirroring cannot be done.
There would need to be two DS entries for each of "#/export1" and "#/export2"
in order to support a
.Dq mirror_level
of two.
.Pp
If mirroring is enabled, the server must use the Flexible File
layout.
If mirroring is not enabled, the server will use the File layout
by default, but this default can be changed to the Flexible File layout if the
.Xr sysctl 1
vfs.nfsd.default_flexfile
is set non-zero.
.It Fl t
Serve
.Tn TCP NFS
clients.
.It Fl u
Serve
.Tn UDP NFS
clients.
.It Fl e
Ignored; included for backward compatibility.
.El
.Pp
For example,
.Dq Li "nfsd -u -t -n 6"
serves
.Tn UDP
and
.Tn TCP
transports using six daemons.
.Pp
A server should run enough daemons to handle
the maximum level of concurrency from its clients,
typically four to six.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility listens for service requests at the port indicated in the
.Tn NFS
server specification; see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC1094,
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" ,
RFC1813,
.%T "Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Protocol" ,
RFC3530 and
.%T "Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Minor Version 1 Protocol" ,
RFC5661.
.Pp
If
.Nm
detects that
.Tn NFS
is not loaded in the running kernel, it will attempt
to load a loadable kernel module containing
.Tn NFS
support using
.Xr kldload 2 .
If this fails, or no
.Tn NFS
KLD is available,
.Nm
will exit with an error.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is to be run on a host with multiple interfaces or interface aliases, use
of the
.Fl h
option is recommended.
If you do not use the option NFS may not respond to
UDP packets from the same IP address they were sent to.
Use of this option
is also recommended when securing NFS exports on a firewalling machine such
that the NFS sockets can only be accessed by the inside interface.
The
.Nm ipfw
utility
would then be used to block nfs-related packets that come in on the outside
interface.
.Pp
If the server has stopped servicing clients and has generated a console message
like
.Dq Li "nfsd server cache flooded..." ,
the value for vfs.nfsd.tcphighwater needs to be increased.
This should allow the server to again handle requests without a reboot.
Also, you may want to consider decreasing the value for
vfs.nfsd.tcpcachetimeo to several minutes (in seconds) instead of 12 hours
when this occurs.
.Pp
Unfortunately making vfs.nfsd.tcphighwater too large can result in the mbuf
limit being reached, as indicated by a console message
like
.Dq Li "kern.ipc.nmbufs limit reached" .
If you cannot find values of the above
.Nm sysctl
values that work, you can disable the DRC cache for TCP by setting
vfs.nfsd.cachetcp to 0.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility has to be terminated with
.Dv SIGUSR1
and cannot be killed with
.Dv SIGTERM
or
.Dv SIGQUIT .
The
.Nm
utility needs to ignore these signals in order to stay alive as long
as possible during a shutdown, otherwise loopback mounts will
not be able to unmount.
If you have to kill
.Nm
just do a
.Dq Li "kill -USR1 <PID of master nfsd>"

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
If
.Nm
is started when
.Xr gssd 8
is not running, it will service AUTH_SYS requests only. To fix the problem
you must kill
.Nm
and then restart it, after the
.Xr gssd 8
is running.
.Pp
If mirroring is enabled via the
.Fl m
option and there are Linux clients doing NFSv4.1 mounts, those clients
need to be patched to support the
.Dq tightly coupled
variant of
the Flexible File layout or the
.Xr sysctl 1
vfs.nfsd.flexlinuxhack
must be set to one on the MDS as a workaround.
