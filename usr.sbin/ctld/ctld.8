.Sh NAME
.Nm ctld
.Nd CAM Target Layer / iSCSI target daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl f Ar config-file
.Op Fl u
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon is responsible for managing the CAM Target Layer configuration,
accepting incoming iSCSI connections, performing authentication and
passing connections to the kernel part of the native iSCSI target.
.Pp
Upon startup, the
.Nm
daemon parses the configuration file.
If it encounters any errors,
.Nm
exits.
It then compares the configuration with the kernel list of LUNs managed
by previously running
.Nm
instances, removes LUNs no longer existing in the configuration file,
and creates new LUNs as necessary.
After that it listens for the incoming iSCSI connections, performs
authentication, and, if successful, passes the connections to the kernel part
of CTL iSCSI target,
.Xr cfiscsi 4 ,
which handles it from that point.
.Pp
When it receives a SIGHUP signal, the
.Nm
reloads its configuration and applies the changes to the kernel.
Changes are applied in a way that avoids unnecessary disruptions;
for example removing one LUN does not affect other LUNs.
.Pp
When exiting gracefully, the
.Nm
daemon removes LUNs it managed and forcibly disconnects all the clients.
Otherwise - for example, when killed with SIGKILL - LUNs stay configured
and clients remain connected.
.Pp
To perform administrative actions that apply to already connected
sessions, such as forcing termination, use
.Xr ctladm 8 .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl P Ar pidfile"
.It Fl f Ar config-file
Specifies the name of the configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /etc/ctl.conf .
.It Fl d
Debug mode.
The daemon sends verbose debug output to standard error, and does not
put itself in the background.
The daemon will also not fork and will exit after processing one connection.
This option is only intended for debugging the target.
.It Fl u
Use UCL configuration file format instead of the traditional non-UCL format.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /var/run/ctld.pid" -compact
.It Pa /etc/ctl.conf
The configuration file for
.Nm .
The file format and configuration options are described in
.Xr ctl.conf 5 .
.It Pa /var/run/ctld.pid
The default location of the
.Nm
PID file.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
