.Sh NAME
.Nm pnfsdscopymr
.Nd
copy or move a data storage file for a MDS file to a different DS
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl r Ar mounted-on-DS-dir
.Op Fl m Ar source-mounted-on-DS-dir destination-mounted-on-DS-dir
.Ar mdsfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command copies a data storage file for an MDS file from one DS to another DS.
It is normally used to recover data files onto a repaired DS, but can also
be used to manually migrate a data storage file from one DS to a different one.
By default, the command will copy the data storage file for
.Dq mdsfile
to one of the other DSs to create a mirror of it.
This might be done if the file was created before mirroring was enabled on
the pNFS service and now needs to be mirrored.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl r Ar mounted-on-DS-dir
This option indicates that the data storage file should be created on the DS
that is mounted on the directory
.Dq mounted-on-DS-dir .
It will only do the copy if there is an entry in the pnfsd.dsfile extended
attribute that has an IP address of 0.0.0.0.
See
.Xr pnfsdsfile 1
for how to do this.
This is normally done for all regular files via
.Xr find 1
in order to recover the data
storage files onto a repaired DS.
.It Fl m Ar source-mounted-on-DS-dir destination-mounted-on-DS-dir
This option indicates that the data storage file is to be migrated from
the source DS mounted on the diectory
.Dq source-mounted-on-DS-dir
to the DS mounted on the directory
.Dq destination-mounted-on-DS-dir .
In this case, the data storage file will be removed from the source DS
when the copy is completed.
.El
If the copy/migration is already done, the command will simply exit(0),
so that it can safely be used on all regular files in the exported directory
tree on the MDS.
.Pp
This command must be run on the MDS and a typical usage would be as an
argument for
.Xr find 1
for all regular files.
.sp
For example, if the repaired DS is mounted on /data3 and files previously
stored on the repaired DS have had the DS's IP address set to 0.0.0.0:
.br
# cd <top-level-exported-directory-on-the-MDS>
.br
# find . -type f -exec pnfsdscopymr -r /data3 {} \\;
