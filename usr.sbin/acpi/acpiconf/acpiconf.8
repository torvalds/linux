.Sh NAME
.Nm acpiconf
.Nd control ACPI power management
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl i Ar batt
.Op Fl k Ar ack
.Op Fl s Ar type
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility allows the user control of the ACPI power management
functions.
The following command-line options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl s Ar type"
.It Fl h
Displays a summary of available options.
.It Fl i Ar batt
Get design information and current status of the battery specified
by its number, starting with
.Cm 0 .
.It Fl k Ar ack
Ack or abort a pending suspend request using the argument provided.
.Sy Most users should not use this option directly.
.It Fl s Ar type
Enters the specified sleep mode.
Recognized types are
.Cm 1
(only the CPU clock is stopped),
.Cm 2
(not implemented on most systems but similar to S1),
.Cm 3
(the CPU context is lost and memory context is preserved),
and
.Cm 4
(the CPU context is lost and memory context is stored to disk).
Sleep states may also be given as S1, S2, etc.
The supported states depend on BIOS implementation, including ACPI
byte code (AML).
If the
.Pa /etc/rc.suspend
and
.Pa /etc/rc.resume
scripts are executable, they will be run by
.Xr devd 8
or
.Xr apmd 8
before and after entering the given sleep state.
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/rc.resume
script uses the
.Xr rcorder 8
utility to call scripts in
.Pa /etc/rc.d/
and the
.Va $local_startup
directories that have a "resume" KEYWORD.
Called scripts are supplied with single "resume"
command line argument. See
.Xr rc.conf 5
for more information about
.Va $local_startup .
