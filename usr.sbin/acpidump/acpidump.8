.Sh NAME
.Nm acpidump
.Nd dump ACPI tables
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl o Ar prefix
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command stores ACPI tables from physical memory into files specified by
.Ar prefix .
If
.Ar prefix
specifies a directory, the generated files will be of the form
<prefix>/<sig>.<id>.
Otherwise, they will be named <prefix>.<sig>.<id>.
.Dq sig
is the signature of the ACPI Table;
.Dq id
is unique for each table.
.Pp
Additionally a file called <prefix>/headers or <prefix>.headers will
be created that contains additional human readable information
pertaining to this specific dump.
.Pp
The ACPICA disassembler is available through the
.Ox
ports tree or package system:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# pkg_add acpica
$ iasl -d <prefix>.<sig>.<id>
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
requires the ability to open
.Pa /dev/kmem ,
which may be restricted based upon the value of the
.Ar kern.allowkmem
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.Pp
.Nm
is run at startup and stores the results in
.Pa /var/db/acpi .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/mem
.It Pa /dev/mem
