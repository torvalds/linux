.Sh NAME
.Nm bsdinstall
.Nd system installer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar options
.Op Ar target
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used for installation of new systems, both for system setup from
installation media, e.g., CD-ROMs, and for use on live systems to prepare
VM images and jails.
.Pp
Much like
.Xr make 1 , Nm
takes a target and possible parameters of the target as arguments.
If invoked with no arguments, it will invoke the
.Cm auto
target, which provides a standard interactive installation, invoking the
others in sequence.
To perform a scripted installation,
these subtargets can be invoked separately by an installation script.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Nm
supports the following options, global to all targets:
.Bl -tag -width indent+
.It Fl D Ar file
Provide a path for the installation log file
.Pq overrides Ev BSDINSTALL_LOG .
See
.Sx ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
for more information on
.Ev BSDINSTALL_LOG .
.El
.Sh TARGETS
Most of the following targets are only useful for scripting the installer.
For interactive use, most users will be interested only in the
.Cm auto ,
.Cm jail ,
and
.Cm script
targets.
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm jail Ar destination"
.It Cm auto
Run the standard interactive installation, including disk partitioning.
.It Cm jail Ar destination
Sets up a new chroot system at
.Pa destination ,
suitable for use with
.Xr jail 8 .
Behavior is generally similar to
.Cm auto ,
except that disk partitioning and network setup are skipped and a kernel is
not installed into the new system.
.It Cm script Ar script
Runs the installation script at
.Pa script .
See
.Sx SCRIPTING
for more information on this target.
.It Cm keymap
If the current controlling TTY is a
.Xr syscons 4
or
.Xr vt 4
console, asks the user to set the current keymap, and saves the result to the
new system's
.Pa rc.conf .
.It Cm hostname
Prompts the user for a host name for the new system and saves the result to the
new system's
.Pa rc.conf .
If
.Ev BSDINSTALL_CONFIGCURRENT
is set, also sets the host name of the current system.
.It Cm netconfig
Interactively configures network interfaces (first invoking
.Cm wlanconfig
on wireless interfaces), saving the result to the new system's
.Pa rc.conf
and
.Pa resolv.conf .
If
.Ev BSDINSTALL_CONFIGCURRENT
is set, also configures the network interfaces of the current system to match.
.It Cm autopart
Provides the installer's interactive guided disk partitioner for single-disk
installations.
Defaults to UFS.
.It Cm zfsboot
Provides an alternative ZFS-only automatic interactive disk partitioner.
Creates a single
.Ic zpool
with separate datasets for
.Pa /tmp ,
.Pa /usr ,
.Pa /usr/home ,
.Pa /usr/ports ,
.Pa /usr/src ,
and
.Pa /var .
Optionally can set up
.Xr geli 8
to encrypt the disk.
.It Cm partedit
Provides the installer's interactive manual disk partitioner with an interface
identical to
.Xr sade 8 .
Supports multiple disks as well as UFS, ZFS, and FAT file systems.
ZFS is set up with one pool and dataset per partition.
.It Cm scriptedpart Ar parameters
Sets up disks like
.Cm autopart
and
.Cm partedit ,
but non-interactively according to the disk setup specified in
.Ar parameters .
Each disk setup is specified by a three-part argument:
.Pp
.Ar disk
.Op Ar scheme
.Op Ar {partitions}
.Pp
Multiple disk setups are separated by semicolons.
The
.Ar disk
argument specifies the disk on which to operate (which will be erased),
while the
.Ar scheme
argument specifies the
.Xr gpart 8
partition scheme to apply to the disk.
If
.Ar scheme
is unspecified,
.Cm scriptedpart
will apply the default bootable scheme on your platform.
The
.Ar partitions
argument is also optional and specifies how to partition
.Ar disk .
It consists of a comma-separated list of partitions to create enclosed in
curly braces.
Each partition declaration takes the form
.Pp
.Ar size
.Ar type
.Op Ar mount point
.Pp
.Ar size
specifies the partition size to create in bytes (K, M, and G suffixes
can be appended to specify kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes respectively),
while the
.Em auto
keyword causes the partition to take all the remaining space on the disk.
The
.Ar type
option chooses the
.Xr gpart 8
filesystem type, e.g., freebsd-ufs, freebsd-zfs, or freebsd-swap.
The optional
.Ar mount point
argument sets where the created partition is to be mounted in the installed
system.
As an example, a typical invocation looks like:
.Pp
bsdinstall scriptedpart ada0 { 20G freebsd-ufs /, 4G freebsd-swap, 20G freebsd-ufs /var, auto freebsd-ufs /usr }
.Pp
A shorter invocation to use the default partitioning (as
.Cm autopart
would have used) on the same disk:
.Pp
bsdinstall scriptedpart ada0
.It Cm mount
Mounts the file systems previously configured by
.Cm autopart ,
.Cm partedit ,
or
.Cm scriptedpart
under
.Ev BSDINSTALL_CHROOT .
.It Cm distfetch
Fetches the distributions in
.Ev DISTRIBUTIONS
to
.Ev BSDINSTALL_DISTDIR
from
.Ev BSDINSTALL_DISTSITE .
.It Cm checksum
Verifies the checksums of the distributions listed in
.Ev DISTRIBUTIONS
against the distribution manifest.
.It Cm distextract
Extracts the distributions listed in
.Ev DISTRIBUTIONS
into
.Ev BSDINSTALL_CHROOT .
.It Cm rootpass
Interactively invokes
.Xr passwd 1
in the new system to set the root user's password.
.It Cm adduser
Interactively invokes
.Xr adduser 8
in the new system.
.It Cm time
Interactively sets the time, date, and time zone of the new system.
.It Cm services
Queries the user for the system daemons to begin at system startup,
writing the result into the new system's
.Pa rc.conf .
.It Cm entropy
Reads a small amount of data from
.Pa /dev/random
and stores it in a file in the new system's root directory.
.It Cm config
Installs the configuration files destined for the new system, e.g.,
.Xr rc.conf 5
fragments generated by
.Cm netconfig ,
etc.) onto the new system.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables control various aspects of the installation
process.
Many are used internally during installation and have reasonable default values
for most installation scenarios.
Others are set by various interactive user prompts, and can be usefully
overridden when making scripted or customized installers.
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev BSDINSTALL_DISTSITE"
.It Ev DISTRIBUTIONS
The set of distributions to install, e.g., "base kernel ports".
Default: unset
.It Ev BSDINSTALL_DISTDIR

already present in the directory defined by
.Ev BSDINSTALL_DISTDIR .
This should be a full path to the files, including architecture and release
names.
Most targets, e.g.,
.Cm auto
and
.Cm jail ,
that prompt for a
.Fx
mirror will skip that step if this variable is already defined in the
environment.

take a look into the default value of it.
.It Ev ZFSBOOT_CONFIRM_LAYOUT
If set and the installation is interactive, allow the user to confirm
the layout before continuing with the installation.
Default:
.Dq 1
.El
.Sh SCRIPTING
.Nm
scripts consist of two parts: a
.Em preamble
and a
.Em setup script .
The preamble sets up the options for the installation (how to partition the
disk[s], which distributions to install, etc.) and the optional second part is
a shell script run under
.Xr chroot 8
in the newly installed system before
.Nm
exits.
The two parts are separated by the usual script header (#!), which also sets
the interpreter for the setup script.
.Pp
A typical bsdinstall script looks like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
PARTITIONS=ada0
DISTRIBUTIONS="kernel.txz base.txz"

#!/bin/sh
sysrc ifconfig_em0=DHCP
sysrc sshd_enable=YES
pkg install puppet
.Ed
.Pp
For a ZFS scripted installation, the script looks like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
DISTRIBUTIONS="kernel.txz base.txz"
export ZFSBOOT_VDEV_TYPE=stripe
export ZFSBOOT_DISKS=ada0
export nonInteractive="YES"

#!/bin/sh
echo "ifconfig_em0=DHCP" >> /etc/rc.conf
echo "sshd_enable=YES" >> /etc/rc.conf
pkg install puppet
.Ed
.Pp
On
.Fx
release media, such a script placed at
.Pa /etc/installerconfig
will be run at boot time and the system will be rebooted automatically after
the installation has completed.
This can be used for unattended network installation of new systems; see
.Xr diskless 8
for details.
.Ss PREAMBLE
The preamble consists of installer settings.
These control global installation parameters (see
.Sx ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES )
as well as disk partitioning.
The preamble is interpreted as a
.Xr sh 1
script run at the very beginning of the install.
If more complicated behavior than setting these variables is desired,
arbitrary commands can be run here to extend the installer.
In addition to the variables in
.Sx ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ,
in particular
.Ev DISTRIBUTIONS ,
the preamble can contain a variable
.Ev PARTITIONS
which is passed to the
.Cm scriptedpart
target to control disk setup.
Alternatively,
to use
.Cm zfsboot
instead of
.Cm partedit ,
the preamble can contain the variable
.Ev ZFSBOOT_DATASETS
instead of
.Ev PARTITIONS ,
and setting the variables
.Ev ZFSBOOT_DISKS
and
.Ev ZFSBOOT_VDEV_TYPE
to create the pool of disks for the base system.
Usually, for a mirrored booting disk, this two variables looks like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ZFSBOOT_DISKS="ada0 ada1"
ZFSBOOT_VDEV_TYPE=mirror
.Ed
.Pp
Remenber to export all the variables for the
.Cm zfsboot
command, otherwise it will not get set.
.Ss SETUP SCRIPT
Following the preamble is an optional shell script, beginning with a #!
declaration.
This script will be run at the end of the installation process inside a
.Xr chroot 8
environment in the newly installed system and can be used to set up
configuration files, install packages, etc.
Note that newly configured system services, e.g., networking have not
been started in the installed system at this time and only installation
host services are available.
.Ss ZFS DATASETS
The
.Cm zfsboot
partitioning takes the
.Ev ZFSBOOT_DATASETS
variable to create the datasets on the base system.
This variable can get pretty huge if the pool contains a lot of datasets.
The default value of the
.Ev ZFSBOOT_DATASETS
looks like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# DATASET	OPTIONS (comma or space separated; or both)

# Boot Environment [BE] root and default boot dataset
/$ZFSBOOT_BEROOT_NAME				mountpoint=none
/$ZFSBOOT_BEROOT_NAME/$ZFSBOOT_BOOTFS_NAME	mountpoint=/

# Compress /tmp, allow exec but not setuid
/tmp		mountpoint=/tmp,exec=on,setuid=off

# Do not mount /usr so that 'base' files go to the BEROOT
/usr		mountpoint=/usr,canmount=off

# Home directories separated so they are common to all BEs
/usr/home	# NB: /home is a symlink to /usr/home

# Ports tree
/usr/ports	setuid=off

# Source tree (compressed)
/usr/src

# Create /var and friends
/var		mountpoint=/var,canmount=off
/var/audit	exec=off,setuid=off
/var/crash	exec=off,setuid=off
/var/log	exec=off,setuid=off
/var/mail	atime=on
/var/tmp	setuid=off
.Ed
.Pp
The first column if the dataset to be created on the top of the
.Ev ZFSBOOT_POOL_NAME
and the rest of the columns are the options to be set on each dataset.
The options must be written on a coma or space separated list, or both.
And everything behind a pound/hash character is ignored as a comment.
