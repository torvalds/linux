.Sh NAME
.Nm sade
.Nd sysadmins disk editor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used for various disk administration tasks on
.Fx
systems.
.Pp
It is generally invoked without arguments for the default
behavior, where the main menu is presented.
.Sh NOTES
The
.Nm
utility aims to provide a handy tool for disk management
tasks on an already installed system.
The goal is to provide the same text interface for disk management in
.Xr bsdinstall 8
in the post-installation environment.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bsdinstall 8 ,
.Xr gpart 8
.Sh HISTORY
A program called
.Nm
first appeared in
.Fx 6.3
as a utility encapsulating features from the
.Xr sysinstall 8
installer.
It was replaced in
.Fx 10.0
with the equivalent part of
.Xr bsdinstall 8 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Nathan Whitehorn Aq Mt nwhitehorn@FreeBSD.org
.Sh BUGS
The utility misses a lot of nice features, such as tools for
manipulating
.Xr gmirror 8 .
These will be added later.
