.Sh NAME
.Nm ypinit
.Nd build and install NIS databases
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl m
.Op Ar domainname
.Nm
.Fl s
.Ar master_server
.Op Ar domainname
.Nm
.Fl u
.Op Ar domainname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a script which sets up databases on a Network Information Service
(NIS)
master or slave server.
.Pp
On a master server,
.Nm
creates the
.Pa /var/yp/$DOMAINNAME
directory, the
.Pa /var/yp/ypservers
file, and calls
.Pa /var/yp/Makefile
to create and populate an initial set of NIS maps.
The maps are
created from local source files using the
.Xr yp_mkdb 8
utility.
The utility will prompt the user for a list of servers
that support the specified domain; this list is used to populate
the ypservers map.
.Pp
On a slave server,
.Nm
creates the
.Pa /var/yp/$DOMAINNAME ,
populates it with copies of the NIS maps from the master.
The maps
are obtained from the master using the
.Xr ypxfr 8
utility.
The
.Nm
utility obtains the list of maps to transfer in one of two ways: if
the system is configured as an NIS client and is bound to the master
server,
.Nm
is able to use the
.Xr ypwhich 1
utility to obtain a list of maps exported by the master server.
If the system is not configured as a client of the NIS master,
.Nm
uses a hardcoded list of maps, some of which may or may not actually
exist on the master.
The system administrator can edit the
.Nm
script and
modify the map list if necessary.
Otherwise, individual maps can
be transferred manually from the master using
.Xr ypxfr 8 .
.Sh OPTIONS
The
.Nm
utility supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl m Op Ar domainname
Set up a master server.
By default,
.Nm
sets up a server for
the system default domain.
The user can override this default by specifying
.Ar domainname
explicitly.
Maps are constructed from scratch using local files as templates using
the
.Xr yp_mkdb 8
utility.
.It Fl s Ar master_server Op Ar domainname
Set up a slave server using
.Ar master_name
as the master.
Maps are copied from
.Ar master_server
to the slave using
.Xr ypxfr 8 .
By default,
.Nm
sets up a server for
the system default domain.
The user can override this default by specifying
.Ar domainname
explicitly.
.It Fl u Op Ar domainname
Update the ypservers map on the master server.
When a new slave
server is added to a domain, its hostname must be added to the
ypservers map so that
.Xr yppush 8
can propagate updates on the master to all of the slaves.
