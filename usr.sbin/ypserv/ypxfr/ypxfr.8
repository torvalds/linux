.Nd get a YP map from YP server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ypxfr
.Op Fl cf
.Op Fl C Ar tid prog ipadd port
.Op Fl d Ar domain
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl s Ar domain
.Ar mapname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm ypxfr
is the utility in YP that transfers maps to the local host.
.Pp
Since the YP master transfers a map when it has changed, a YP slave should
check for missed maps regularly.
This can be done via an entry in
.Xr crontab 5 .
The scripts
.Ar ypxfr_1perhour , ypxfr_2perday
and
.Ar ypxfr_1perday
could be used for that.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C Ar tid prog ipadd port
This option is only used by ypserv.
This is to open communication with a yppush on another host.
.It Fl c
Don't send a "Clear current map" to local ypserv process.
Useful if ypserv isn't running locally to avoid timeout message.
.It Fl d Ar domain
Don't use default domain, use the specified domain.
.It Fl f
Force map transfer, even if version of master is older than local copy.
.It Fl h Ar host
Get map from host instead of the maps master host.
.It Fl s Ar domain
Specify a source domain other than the target domain.
