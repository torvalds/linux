.Dt NETID 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm netid
.Nd YP network credential file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /etc/netid
consists of newline separated ASCII records.
Each record consists of a key, a single blank character, and a value.
The key and the value may be arbitrary strings except that neither
may contain blank characters.
.Pp
Records in the file
.Pa /etc/netid
and in the
.Pa netid.byname
YP map are ignored by the system unless they have the following form:
.Bd -literal
unix.<uid>@<yp-domain> <uid>:<gid>,<gid>,...
.Ed
.Pp
When YP is enabled in the
.Xr group 5
file, such records specify that the function
.Xr getgrouplist 3
shall return the specified groups in addition to the groups
found in the group file.
The file
.Pa /etc/netid
is parsed before the
.Pa netid.byname
YP map.
Only the first matching record is used.
.Pp
The main use of the
.Pa /etc/netid
file is to allow certain users to log in even while YP is enabled but
temporarily unavailable.
These users must also be listed in the local
.Xr master.passwd 5
file.
If consistency of group membership information is required while YP is
enabled and available, all records in the
.Pa /etc/netid
file must agree with records in the
.Pa netid.byname
YP map, although the latter may contain additional records.
If consistency of group membership information is required even while YP is
enabled but unavailable, the records in the
.Pa /etc/netid
file must not grant more group memberships than the
.Xr group 5
file, and users having their own record in the
.Pa /etc/netid
file must not show up in the
.Pa group.byname
and
.Pa group.bygid
YP maps.
.Pp
On a YP master server,
.Xr Makefile.yp 8
uses the
.Xr mknetid 8
utility to generate the
.Pa netid.byname
YP map.
In this case, the YP map will also contain records of the following form:
.Bd -literal
unix.<hostname>@<yp-domain> 0:<hostname>
.Ed
.Pp
Such records are ignored by the system.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/netid -compact
.It Pa /etc/netid
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
A netid file or YP map might look like the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
unix.10714@kaka 10714:400,10
unix.jodie@kaka 0:jodie
