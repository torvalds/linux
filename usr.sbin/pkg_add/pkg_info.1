.Dt PKG_INFO 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_info
.Nd display information on software packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkg_info
.Bk -words
.Op Fl AaCcdfIKLMmPqRSstUvz
.Op Fl D Ar name Ns Op = Ns Ar value
.Op Fl E Ar filename
.Op Fl e Ar pkg-name
.Op Fl l Ar str
.Op Fl Q Ar substring
.Op Fl r Ar pkgspec
.Op Ar pkg-name ...
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to dump out information for packages, as created by
.Xr pkg_create 1 ,
which may be still
packed up or already installed on the system with the
.Xr pkg_add 1
command.
.Pp
The
.Ar pkg-name
may be the name of an installed package, the pathname to a package
distribution file, or a URL to a package available through FTP, HTTP, HTTPS,
or SCP.
.Nm
will try to complete
.Ar pkg-name
with a version number while looking through installed packages.
If no
.Ar pkg-name
is specified,
.Nm
shows the names and one-line comments for all installed packages
except internal packages.
.Pp
When browsing through uninstalled packages, running
.Ic pkg_info -I *.tgz
will report a summary line for each package, so that it is possible to
run
.Ic pkg_info pkgname.tgz
to obtain a longer package description, and
.Ic pkg_add -n pkgname.tgz
to check that the installation would proceed cleanly, including dependencies.
.Pp
The following command-line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A
Show the names and one-line comments for all installed packages,
including internal packages.
This option cannot be combined with
.Ar pkg-name
arguments.
.It Fl a
Show the names and one-line comments for all installed packages
except internal packages.
This option cannot be combined with
.Ar pkg-name
arguments.
It is the default when neither options nor arguments are given.
.It Fl C
Show certificate information for signed packages.
.It Fl c
Show the one-line comment field for each package.
.It Fl D Ar name Ns Op = Ns Ar value
Enforce extra options as given by
.Ar name ,
similarly to
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "updatedependsXX" -compact
.It Cm SIGNER
List of trusted signers, separated by commas.
Corresponds to list of public keys under
.Pa /etc/signify
we want to trust.
Defaults to any key matching
.Sq *pkg
for packages, and any key matching
.Sq *fw
for firmware.
.It Cm snap
Force
.Sq %c
and
.Sq %m
to expand to
.Sq snapshots ,
even on a release kernel.
.It Cm unsigned
Allow opening unsigned packages without warnings/errors
(necessary for
.Xr ports 7 ,
automatically set by the build infrastructure).
.El
.It Fl d
Show the long-description field for each package.
.It Fl E Ar filename
Look for the package(s) that contains the given
.Ar filename .
As a faster alternative, note that there is a package, pkglocatedb, that
contains a
.Xr locate 1
database of every file in every package.
.It Fl e Ar pkg-name
This option
allows you to test for the presence of another (perhaps
prerequisite) package from a script.
If the package identified by
.Ar pkg-name
is currently installed, return 0, otherwise return 1.
In addition, the names of any package(s) found installed are printed to
stdout unless turned off using the
.Fl q
option.
.Pp
The given
.Ar pkg-name
is actually a package specification, as described in
.Xr packages-specs 7 .
For example,
.Ic pkg_info -e 'name->=1.3'
will match versions 1.3 and later of the
.Pa name
package.
.It Fl e Ar pkgpath
Another variant of this option that uses a pkgpath instead.
A pkgpath is a location within the ports tree, as described
in
.Xr pkgpath 7 .
For example,
.Ic pkg_info -e x11/kde/base3
will match any package that was compiled according to
.Pa ${PORTSDIR}/x11/kde/base3 .
.It Fl f
Show the packing-list instructions for each package.
See
.Xr pkg_create 1
and
.Xr package 5
for the various annotations.
.It Fl I
Show the name and one-line comment
.Pq Dq index entry
for each package.
This is done by default if neither options nor arguments are given.
.It Fl K
Prefix file names with category keyword (e.g., @file, @lib).
Always used together with
.Fl L .
.It Fl L
Show the files within each package.
This is different from just
viewing the packing-list, since full pathnames for everything
are generated.
.It Fl l Ar str
Prefix each information category header (see
.Fl q )
shown with
.Ar str .
This is primarily of use to front-end programs that want to request a
lot of different information fields at once for a package, but don't
necessarily want the output intermingled in such a way that they can't
organize it.
This lets you add a special token to the start of each field.
.It Fl M
Show the install-message file (if any) for each package.
.It Fl m
Show the names and one-line comments for all packages tagged as manually
installed, omitting those automatically installed as dependencies.
This option cannot be combined with
.Ar pkg-name
arguments.
.It Fl P
Show the
.Xr pkgpath 7
for each package.
You can easily build a subdirlist with this.
.It Fl Q Ar substring
Show the names of all packages in the first repository
of the package search path containing the
.Ar substring
in the stems of their package names.
A stem is a package name with all version and flavor suffixes removed; see
.Xr pkg_add 1
for more details on stems.
If
.Fl a
is also specified, show the names of all matching packages
in all repositories instead.
.It Fl q
Be
.Dq quiet
in emitting report headers and such, just dump the
raw info (basically, assume a non-human reading).
.It Fl R
Show which packages require a given package.
.It Fl r Ar pkgspec
Check a list for a given
.Ar pkgspec .
The following arguments are names of packages to verify.
Exit status will be augmented by 2 if none of the packages do match.
.It Fl S
Show the update signature for each package.
The
.Sq update signature
is a unique tag showing the package name, a global version number,
and the version number
of every run time dependency and shared library used to build this package.
.It Fl s
Show an estimate of the total size of each package.
.It Fl t
Show the names and one-line comments for packages
which are not required by any other packages.
This option cannot be combined with
.Ar pkg-name
arguments.
.It Fl U
Show the deinstall-message file (if any) for each package.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
.It Fl z
Fuzzy listing option, often used together with
.Fl m .
Only shows stems, flavors and branches information.
To be reused with
.Xr pkg_add 1
.Fl l
to recreate a package installation with different versions and no ambiguity.
Note that this intentionally does not include firmware, as they are not
handled by
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width PKG_TMPDIR
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
The standard package database directory,
.Pa /var/db/pkg ,
can be overridden by specifying an alternative directory in the
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
environment variable.
.It Ev PKG_PATH
This can be used to specify a colon-separated list of paths to search for
package files.
The current directory is always searched first, even if
.Ev PKG_PATH
is set.
If
.Ev PKG_PATH
is used, the suffix
.Dq .tgz
is automatically appended to the
.Ar pkg-name ,
whereas searching in the current directory uses
.Ar pkg-name
literally.
Each entry consists of a directory name.
URL schemes such as FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, or SCP are also appropriate.
The current directory may be indicated
implicitly by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a single
period
.Pq Ql \&./ .
Special sequences
.Sq %a ,
.Sq %c ,
.Sq %m ,
.Sq %v
will be expanded.
.It Ev PKG_TMPDIR
Temporary area where package information files will be extracted, instead of
.Pa /tmp .
.It Ev TRUSTED_PKG_PATH
Same semantics as
.Ev PKG_PATH ,
but it is searched before
.Ev PKG_PATH
and waives any kind of signature checking.
.El
.Sh FILES
