.Nd create a locate database for packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkg_mklocatedb
.Bk -words
.Op Fl aKnPqu
.Op Fl d Ar repository
.Op Fl p Ar portsdir
.Op Ar pkg-name ...

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to create a file database for binary packages,
which can be searched using the
.Xr locate 1
utility.
.Pp
Entries created for each package will have the package name prepended:
.Li kdelibs-3.3.2p2:/usr/local/bin/meinproc .
.Pp
If the
.Fl p
option is used,
and
.Ev SUBDIRLIST
is not defined,
.Nm
will retrieve all package entries from the ports tree.
.Pp
If the
.Fl p
option is used
together with
.Ev SUBDIRLIST ,
.Nm
will retrieve the package entries listed in
.Ev SUBDIRLIST
from the ports tree.
.Pp
Otherwise,
.Nm
will build database entries for every file object for each
.Ar pkg-name
given on the command line,
or for every package in a
.Ar repository
specified as the
.Fl d
option.
If no package name is given,
.Nm
will build database entries for all currently installed packages.
.Pp
By default (unless standard output is a terminal),
the list of names is fed to
.Pa /usr/libexec/locate.mklocatedb
and the end result should be redirected to a file.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Prepend file names with pkgpath information and package names.
.It Fl d Ar repository
Scan directory
.Ar repository
for packages.
.It Fl K
Include keyword in each object full name.
This is more accurate, but defeats
.Xr locate 1
compression.
.Pp
However, note that some meta annotations always make it into the database:
.Cm @*exec* ,
.Cm @define-tag ,
.Cm @newgroup ,
.Cm @newuser ,
.Cm @option Ar no-default-conflict
and
.Cm @tag .
.It Fl n
Do not pipe output to
.Pa /usr/libexec/locate.mklocatedb
(default if standard output is a terminal).
.It Fl P
Prepend file names with pkgpath information instead of package name.
.It Fl p Ar portsdir
Retrieve packing-lists from the ports tree instead of binary packages.
.It Fl q
Be quiet: do not report every package processed to standard error.
.It Fl u
Update an existing list.
The list must come from standard input, and contain pkgpath information
for items to be replaced.
