.Sh NAME
.Nm rarpd
.Nd reverse ARP daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Fl a
.Op Fl dfsv
.Op Fl t Ar directory
.Op Fl P Ar pidfile
.Nm
.Op Fl dfsv
.Op Fl t Ar directory
.Op Fl P Ar pidfile
.Ar interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility services Reverse ARP requests on the Ethernet connected to
.Ar interface .
Upon receiving a request,
.Nm
maps the target hardware address to an IP address via its name, which
must be present in both the
.Xr ethers 5
and
.Xr hosts 5
databases.
If a host does not exist in both databases, the translation cannot
proceed and a reply will not be sent.
.Pp
By default, a request is honored only if the server
(i.e., the host that
.Nm
is running on)
can "boot" the target; that is, a file or directory matching the glob
.Pa /tftpboot/\fIipaddr\fP*
exists, where
.Em ipaddr
is the target IP address in hex.
For example, the IP address 204.216.27.18 will be replied to if any of
.Pa /tftpboot/CCD81B12 ,
.Pa /tftpboot/CCD81B12.SUN3 ,
or
.Pa /tftpboot/CCD81B12-boot
exist.
This requirement can be overridden with the
.Fl s
flag (see below).
.Pp
In normal operation,
.Nm
forks a copy of itself and runs in the background.
Anomalies and errors are reported via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Listen on all the Ethernets attached to the system.
If
.Fl a
is omitted, an interface must be specified.
.It Fl d
If
.Fl f
is also specified,
.Nm
logs messages to
.Em stdout
and
.Em stderr
instead of via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It Fl f
Run in the foreground.
.It Fl P
Specify the pathname of the PID file.
If not specified,
.Pa /var/run/rarpd.pid
or
.Pa /var/run/rarpd.ifname.pid
will be used depending on the
.Fl a
flag or the specified interface name.
.It Fl s
Supply a response to any RARP request for which an ethernet to IP address
mapping exists; do not depend on the existence of
.Pa /tftpboot/\fIipaddr\fP* .
.It Fl t
Supply an alternate tftp root directory to
.Pa /tftpboot ,
similar to the
.Fl s
option of
.Xr tftpd 8 .
This permits
.Nm
to selectively respond to RARP requests, but use an alternate directory
for IP checking.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose syslogging.

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
utility can depend on the DNS to resolve the name discovered from
.Pa /etc/ethers .
If this name is not in the DNS but is in
.Pa /etc/hosts ,
the DNS lookup can cause a delayed RARP response, so in this situation
it is recommended to configure
.Xr nsswitch.conf 5
to read
.Pa /etc/hosts
first.
