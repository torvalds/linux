.Sh NAME
.Nm sasyncd.conf
.Nd configuration file for sasyncd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the
.Xr sasyncd 8
daemon.
.Pp
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.
.Pp
Since the file contains the shared secret key used to encrypt data
between this host and the others,
.Pa /etc/sasyncd.conf
must be owned either by
.Dq root
or the
.Dq _isakmpd
pseudo user and be readable only by this owner, e.g.\&
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# chown root /etc/sasyncd.conf
# chmod 0600 /etc/sasyncd.conf
.Ed
.Pp
The following configuration settings are understood:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ic interface
.Ar interface
.Xc
Specify which
.Xr carp 4
interface
.Xr sasyncd 8
should track master/slave state on.
.It Xo
.Ic group
.Ar group
.Xc
Specify on which interface group
.Xr sasyncd 8
should increase the demotion counter.
This has the effect of suppressing
.Xr carp 4
preemption while initial
.Xr sasyncd 8
state is established.
The default is to use the
.Dq carp
group.
.Pp
For more information on interface groups,
see the
.Ic group
keyword in
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.It Ic flushmode sync | startup | never
Controls how the
.Xr sasyncd 8
master host handles SADB_FLUSH messages to its slaves.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "startupXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Ic sync
Pass any SADB_FLUSH messages along.
For example, in this mode
.Xr sasyncd 8
will synchronize an
.Ic ipsecctl -F
command to all connected slaves.
For more information, see
.Xr ipsecctl 8 .
.It Ic startup
Send a SADB_FLUSH message to the slaves as they connect, and act as
.Ic sync
afterwards.
This is the default.
.It Ic never
Never send SADB_FLUSH messages.
.El
.It Xo
.Ic listen on Ar address
.Op Ar family
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Xc
Specify a local IP address, hostname, or interface the
.Xr sasyncd 8
daemon should listen on.
The default is to listen on all local addresses.
When using an interface name,
.Ar family
may be given as
.Dq inet
or
.Dq inet6
to only bind using the specified address family.
Finally,
.Ar port
can be used to specify which TCP port
.Xr sasyncd 8
should listen to.
The default is to listen to port 500.
.It Ic mode master | slave
Force the daemon to run as master or slave.
Normally only intended for debugging use.
.It Ic mode skipslave
Prevent the daemon from syncing SA or SPD messages where the source or
destination address is one of the configured peers.
Intended to permit IPsec
.Xr pfsync 4
protection.
This mode is experimental.
.It Ic peer Ar address
Specify a
.Xr sasyncd 8
peer IP address or hostname.
May be specified multiple times.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
peer 10.0.0.2
peer 10.0.0.3
peer 10.0.0.4
.Ed
.It Ic sharedkey Ar key
The shared AES key used to encrypt messages between
.Xr sasyncd 8
hosts.
This configuration setting is required and must be either 16, 24 or 32
bytes long (corresponding to AES using a 128, 192 or 256 bit key).
.It Ic control isakmpd | iked | all | none
By default,
.Xr sasyncd 8
tracks its local master/slave mode and toggles the passive mode of
.Xr isakmpd 8
accordingly.
This option can be changed to control
.Xr iked 8
instead,
to control all supported daemons at the same time,
or to turn it off to synchronize SAs only.
