.Sh NAME
.Nm rad.conf
.Nd router advertisement daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr rad 8
daemon is an IPv6 router advertisement daemon.
.Pp
The
.Nm
config file is divided into the following main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sx Macros
Definitions of variables that can be used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sx Global configuration
Global settings for
.Xr rad 8 .
These are used as default values for
.Ic interface
definitions and can be overwritten in an
.Ic interface
block.
.It Sx Interfaces
.Xr rad 8
sends IPv6 router advertisement messages.
This section defines on which interfaces to advertise prefix information
and their associated parameters.
.El
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword.
.Ss Macros
A macro is defined with a command of the form
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value .
The macro
.Ar name
can contain letters, digits, and underscores and cannot be a reserved word
(for example,
.Ic interface ) .
Within unquoted arguments, the string
.Pf $ Ar name
is later expanded to
.Ar value .
.Ss Global configuration
The global configuration section sets defaults for router advertisement
messages.
These can be overwritten in interface blocks.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic default router Pq Cm yes Ns | Ns Cm no
Act as a default router or not.
The default is
.Cm yes .
.It Ic dns Brq Ar option ...
Add a DNS router advertisement option
to communicate network provided nameservers.
In a
.Ic dns
block, a
.Cm search
option or at least one
.Cm nameserver
option is required, whereas specifying the
.Cm lifetime
is optional:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm lifetime Ar seconds
The number of seconds the dns options are valid after receiving a router
advertisement message.
The default is 1800 seconds.
.It Cm nameserver Pq Ar address Ns | Ns Brq Ar address ...
IPv6 address or list of IPv6 addresses of DNS name servers.
.It Cm search Pq Ar domain Ns | Ns Brq Ar domain ...
Domain or list of domains for the
.Xr resolv.conf 5
search list.
.El
.It Ic hop limit Ar hops
Specify the diameter of the internet.
The default is 0, meaning unspecified by this router.
.It Ic managed address configuration Pq Cm yes Ns | Ns Cm no
If set to
.Cm yes ,
indicate that stateless address configuration prefixes are
not available and hosts should consult DHCPv6.
The default is
.Cm no .
.It Ic mtu Ar bytes
The MTU option is used in Router Advertisement messages to ensure that all
nodes on a link use the same MTU value in those cases where the link MTU
is not well known.
The default is 0, meaning unspecified by this router.
.It Ic nat64 prefix Ar prefix Op Brq Ar option ...
Add a PREF64 router advertisement option to communicate prefixes used
for Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 to IPv4 (NAT64).
If
.Ar prefix
is specified without a prefix length, its default is 64.
.Pp
.Ic nat64 prefix
options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm lifetime Ar seconds
The number of seconds the nat64 prefix option is valid after receiving a router
advertisement message.
A value of zero indicates to not use the prefix anymore.
The maximum is 65528 seconds.
The default is 1800 seconds.
.El
.It Ic other configuration Pq Cm yes Ns | Ns Cm no
If set to
.Cm yes ,
hosts should consult DHCPv6 for additional configuration
like NTP servers or DNS name servers.
The default is
.Cm no .
.It Ic router lifetime Ar seconds
The number of seconds this router is a valid default router after receiving
a router advertisement message.
The default is 1800 seconds.
.It Ic router preference Pq Cm high Ns | Ns Cm medium Ns | Ns Cm low
Indicate whether to prefer this router over other default routers.
The default is
.Cm medium .
.It Ic reachable time Ar number
The time, in milliseconds, that a node assumes a neighbor is reachable.
The default is 0, meaning unspecified by this router.
This option is ignored by
.Xr slaacd 8
and cannot be set on
.Ox
IPv6 hosts.
.It Ic retrans timer Ar number
The time, in milliseconds, between retransmitted Neighbor Solicitation messages.
The default is 0, meaning unspecified by this router.
This option is ignored by
.Xr slaacd 8
and cannot be set on
.Ox
IPv6 hosts.
.It Ic source link-layer address Pq Cm yes Ns | Ns Cm no
Add a source link-layer address option to router advertisement messages, to
communicate the link-layer address of the sending interface.
The default is
.Cm yes .
.El
.Ss Interfaces
This section contains a list of interfaces or interface groups
to send advertisements on.
At least one
.Ic interface
is required.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic interface Ar name Op Brq Ar prefix ...
Options set in the global section can be overwritten inside an interface
block.
In addition an interface block can contain a list of prefixes:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Oo Cm no Oc Ic auto prefix Op Brq Ar option ...
.It Ic prefix Ar prefix Op Brq Ar option ...
The default is to discover prefixes to announce by inspecting the IPv6
addresses configured on an interface.
This can be disabled with
.Cm no Ic auto prefix .
If
.Ar prefix
is specified without a prefix length, its default is 64.
.Pp
.Ic prefix
options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm autonomous address-configuration Pq Cm yes Ns | Ns Cm no
This prefix can be used to generate IPv6 addresses.
The default is
.Cm yes .
.It Cm on-link Pq Cm yes Ns | Ns Cm no
This prefix is considered on-link.
The default is
.Cm yes .
.It Cm preferred lifetime Ar seconds
The preferred lifetime (pltime) in seconds for addresses generated from this
prefix.
The default is 2700.
This option is ignored if the prefix is discovered from a network interface
and it has a lower preferred lifetime.
.It Cm valid lifetime Ar seconds
The valid lifetime (vltime) in seconds for addresses generated from this
prefix.
The default is 5400.
This option is ignored if the prefix is discovered from a network interface
and it has a lower valid lifetime.
