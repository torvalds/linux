.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg
.Nd a utility for manipulating packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ao Ar command Ac
.Nm
add
.Op Fl f
.Ao Pa pkg.txz Ac
.Nm
.Fl N
.Nm
bootstrap
.Op Fl f
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the package management tool.
It is used to manage local packages installed from
.Xr ports 7
and install/upgrade packages from remote repositories.
.Pp
To avoid backwards incompatibility issues, the actual
.Xr pkg 8
tool is not installed in the base system.
The first time invoked,
.Nm
will bootstrap the real
.Xr pkg 8
from a remote repository.
.Bl -tag -width "pkg bootstrap"
.It Nm Ao Ar command Ac
If
.Xr pkg 8
is not installed yet, it will be fetched, have its signature verified,
installed, and then have the original command forwarded to it.
If already installed, the command requested will be forwarded to the real
.Xr pkg 8 .
.It Nm Li add Oo Fl f Oc Ao Pa pkg.txz Ac
Install
.Xr pkg 8
from a local package instead of fetching from remote.
If a
.Pa pkg.txz.sig
file exists and
signature checking is enabled, then the signature will be verified
before installing the package.
If the
.Fl f
flag is specified, then
.Xr pkg 8
will be installed regardless if it is already installed.
.It Nm Fl N
Do not bootstrap, just determine if
.Xr pkg 8
is actually installed or not.
Returns 0 and the number of packages installed
if it is, otherwise 1.
.It Nm Li bootstrap Op Fl f
Attempt to bootstrap and do not forward anything to
.Xr pkg 8
after it is installed.
If the
.Fl f
flag is specified, then
.Xr pkg 8
will be fetched and installed regardless if it is already installed.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION
Configuration varies in whether it is in a repository configuration file
or the global configuration file.
.Pp
Repository configuration can be stored in
.Pa /etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf
in the following format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
FreeBSD: {
  url: "pkg+http://pkg.FreeBSD.org/${ABI}/latest",
  mirror_type: "srv",
  signature_type: "none",
  fingerprints: "/usr/share/keys/pkg",
  enabled: yes
}
.Ed
.Bl -tag -width signature_type -compact
.It url
Refer to
.Dv PACKAGESITE
in
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
.It mirror_type
Refer to
.Dv MIRROR_TYPE
in
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
.It signature_type
Refer to
.Dv SIGNATURE_TYPE
in
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
.It fingerprints
Refer to
.Dv FINGERPRINTS
in
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
.It enabled
Defines whether this repository should be used or not.
Valid values are
.Dv yes ,
.Dv true ,
.Dv 1 ,
.Dv no ,
.Dv false ,
.Dv 0 .
.El
.Pp
Global configuration can be stored in
.Pa /usr/local/etc/pkg.conf
in the following format:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
PACKAGESITE: "pkg+http://pkg.FreeBSD.org/${ABI}/latest",
MIRROR_TYPE: "srv",
SIGNATURE_TYPE: "none",
FINGERPRINTS: "/usr/share/keys/pkg",
ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES: "yes"
REPOS_DIR: ["/etc/pkg", "/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos"]
.Ed
.Pp
Reference
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
for each variable.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables can be set to override the settings
from the
.Pa pkg.conf
file used.
.Bl -tag -width "ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES"
.It Ev MIRROR_TYPE
This defines which mirror type should be used.
Valid values are
.Dv SRV ,
.Dv HTTP ,
.Dv NONE .
.It Ev ABI
This defines the ABI for the package to be installed.
Default ABI is determined from
.Pa /bin/sh .
.It Ev ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES
If set, no confirmation will be asked when bootstrapping
.Xr pkg 8 .
.It Ev SIGNATURE_TYPE
If set to
.Dv FINGERPRINTS
then a signature will be required and validated against known
certificate fingerprints when bootstrapping
.Xr pkg 8 .
.It Ev FINGERPRINTS
If
.Sy SIGNATURE_TYPE
is set to
.Dv FINGERPRINTS
this value should be set to the directory path where known fingerprints are
located.
.It Ev PACKAGESITE
The URL that
.Xr pkg 8
and other packages
will be fetched from.
.It Ev REPOS_DIR
Comma-separated list of directories that should be searched for repository
configuration files.
.El
.Sh FILES
Configuration is read from the files in the listed order.
This path can be changed by setting
.Sy REPOS_DIR .
The last enabled repository is the one used for bootstrapping
.Xr pkg 8 .
.Bl -tag -width "/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/*.conf"
.It Pa /usr/local/etc/pkg.conf
.It Pa /etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf
.It Pa /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/*.conf
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Some examples are listed here.
The full list of available commands are available in
.Xr pkg 8
once it is bootstrapped.
.Pp
Search for a package:
.Dl $ pkg search perl
.Pp
Install a package:
.Dl % pkg install perl
.Pp
List installed packages:
.Dl $ pkg info
.Pp
Upgrade from remote repository:
.Dl % pkg upgrade
.Pp
List non-automatic packages:
.Dl $ pkg query -e '%a = 0' %o
.Pp
List automatic packages:
.Dl $ pkg query -e '%a = 1' %o
.Pp
Delete an installed package:
.Dl % pkg delete perl
.Pp
Remove unneeded dependencies:
.Dl % pkg autoremove
.Pp
Change a package from automatic to non-automatic, which will prevent
.Ic autoremove
from removing it:
.Dl % pkg set -A 0 perl
.Pp
Change a package from non-automatic to automatic, which will make
.Ic autoremove
allow it be removed once nothing depends on it:
.Dl % pkg set -A 1 perl
.Pp
Create package file from an installed package:
.Dl % pkg create -o /usr/ports/packages/All perl
.Pp
Determine which package installed a file:
.Dl $ pkg which /usr/local/bin/perl
.Pp
Audit installed packages for security advisories:
.Dl $ pkg audit
.Pp
Check installed packages for checksum mismatches:
.Dl # pkg check -s -a
.Pp
Check for missing dependencies:
.Dl # pkg check -d -a

.Xr ports 7 ,
.Xr pkg 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Fx 9.1 .
It became the default package tool in
