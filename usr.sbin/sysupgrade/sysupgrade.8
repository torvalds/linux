.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sysupgrade
.Nd upgrade system to the next release or a new snapshot
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fkns
.Op Fl b Ar base-directory
.Op Fl R Ar version
.Op Ar installurl | path
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility to upgrade
.Ox
to a new release or snapshot if available.
.Pp
.Nm
downloads the necessary files to
.Pa /home/_sysupgrade ,
verifies them with
.Xr signify 1 ,
and copies bsd.rd to
.Pa /bsd.upgrade .
.Pp
.Nm
by default then reboots the system.
The bootloader will automatically choose
.Pa /bsd.upgrade ,
triggering a one-shot upgrade using the files in
.Pa /home/_sysupgrade .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar base-directory
Download files to
.Ar base-directory Ns / Ns Pa _sysupgrade
instead of
.Pa /home/_sysupgrade .
.It Fl f
For snapshots, force an already applied upgrade.
This option has no effect on releases.
.It Fl k
Keep the files in
.Pa /home/_sysupgrade .
By default they will be deleted after the upgrade.
.It Fl n
Fetch and verify the files and create
.Pa /bsd.upgrade
but do not reboot.
.It Fl R Ar version
Upgrade to a specific release version.
Only upgrades from one version to the next are tested.
Skipping versions may work.
Downgrading is unlikely to work.
.It Fl s
Upgrade to a snapshot.
The default is to upgrade to the next release.
.El
.Pp
When updating to a release or snapshot which lacks the required signify
keys in
.Pa /etc/signify ,
the missing keys will be downloaded in a secure way.
In the usual case, the keys will already be present because
.Ox
releases ship with the current key, the next key, and a collection of
older keys.
.Pp
See
.Xr upgrade.site 5
for how to customize the upgrade process.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/auto_upgrade.conf" -compact
