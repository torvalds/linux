.Nm
is a small connection utility for Option N.V. devices that are based on Options
packet interface and uses proprietary AT_* calls to establish connections.
The utility (tries to) configure both default route and name servers
.Po Pa /etc/resolv.conf Pc .
.Pp
By default
.Nm
detaches from the terminal upon on a successful connection, a few command-line
options exists that allows this behavior to be changed.
.Pp
.Nm
attempts to find a usable controlling serial port based on the provided network
interface.
If this fails you might specify a serial port manually.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Fl a Ar apn
Specify APN to connect to.
.It Fl c Ar cid
Specify CID (Context ID) to use, by default CID 1 is used.
If an APN has been configured once, it's enough to specify the CID used for
further accesses.
.It Fl p Ar pin
Specify SIM PIN.
.It Fl u Ar username
Specify username.
.It Fl k Ar password
Specify username.
.It Fl r Ar path
Path to

.Sh EXAMPLES
Connect to
.Dq Li apn.example.com
on interface
.Dq Li uhso0
and use PIN

to enable the SIM card.
.Dl "uhsoctl -a apn.example.com -p 1234 uhso0"
.Pp
