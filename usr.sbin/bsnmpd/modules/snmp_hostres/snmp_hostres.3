.Sh NAME
.Nm snmp_hostres
.Nd host resources module for
.Xr bsnmpd 8
.Sh LIBRARY
.Pq begemotSnmpdModulePath."hostres" = "/usr/lib/snmp_hostres.so"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module implements the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB as standardized in RFC 2790.
.Sh RESTRICTIONS
Not all information in the MIB is meaningful in FreeBSD or is available.
The following variables are not implemented or carry no information:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hrFSType
There are several types of file systems for which no appropriate OID
exists yet which are supported by
.Fx .
For smbfs, procfs and devfs ,
.Va hrFSOther
is returned.
In all other cases,
.Va hrFSUnknown .
.It Va hrFSBootable
It is questionable what bootable means here.
Does it mean that the BIOS is available to start a boot on that file system
or does it mean that there is something bootable?
In either case this information is not available so this variable returns True
for the root file system (which is not necessarily correct) and False for
all others.
.It Va hrFSLastFullBackupDate , hrFSLastPartialBackupDate
This is not available and always returns an empty string.
Theoretically, this could be retrieved from
.Pa /etc/dumpdates ,
which would
hardly be correct given the different ways of doing backups.
.It Va hrDiskStorageTable
Floppy devices are currently not reported.
Also the names of the disks are hard-coded in the module.
