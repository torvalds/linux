.Nd "list jails"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -libxo
.Op Fl dhNnqsv
.Op Fl j Ar jail
.Op Ar parameter ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility lists all active jails, or the specified jail.
Each jail is represented by one row which contains space-separated values of
the listed
.Ar parameters ,
including the pseudo-parameter
.Va all
which will show all available jail parameters.
A list of available parameters can be retrieved via
.Dq Nm sysctl Fl d Va security.jail.param .
See
.Xr jail 8
for a description of some core parameters.
.Pp
If no
.Ar parameters
or any of the options
.Fl hns
are given, the following four columns will be printed:
jail identifier (jid), IP address (ip4.addr), hostname (host.hostname),
and path (path).
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl -libxo
Generate output via
.Xr libxo 3
in a selection of different human and machine readable formats.
See
.Xr xo_parse_args 3
for details on command line arguments.
.It Fl d
List
.Va dying
as well as active jails.
.It Fl h
Print a header line containing the parameters listed.
If no parameters are given on the command line,
.Va all

numeric ID.
If the jail does not have a name, the numeric ID is printed instead.
.It Fl n
Print parameters in
.Dq name=value
format, where each parameter is preceded by its name.
If no parameters are given on the command line,
.Va all
is assumed.
.It Fl q

the empty string.

skipping read-only and unused parameters.

IP address(es) (ip4.addr and ip6.addr).
