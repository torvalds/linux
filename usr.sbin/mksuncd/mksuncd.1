.Sh NAME
.Nm mksuncd
.Nd add a bootable UFS partition to a filesystem image
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mksuncd
.Ar partition-letter
.Ar isofile
.Ar ufsfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility adds the file
.Ar ufsfile
to the end of
.Ar isofile .
.Ar ufsfile
is assumed to be a bootable filesystem image and
.Ar isofile
is assumed to be something like an ISO 9660 filesystem.
A Sun-style disklabel is expected to already be present
at the beginning of
.Ar isofile ,
and
.Nm
will update that label so that the partition (a-h) given by
.Ar partition-letter
points to
.Ar ufsfile
within
.Ar isofile .
.Pp
Based on the label in
.Ar isofile ,
that file is padded so that added files are always on cylinder boundaries.
This is a requirement of the PROM.
.Sh BUGS
This program is not endian or type safe.
It makes several assumptions about both based on its
SPARC bias.
