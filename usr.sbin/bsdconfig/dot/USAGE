	-d    Don't show the date in the graph label.
	-i    Don't show include relationships.

EXAMPLES:
	View dot(1) language output describing bsdconfig(8) layout/make-up:

		bsdconfig @PROGRAM_NAME@ | less

	Render dot(1) output in SVG format (displays in most modern browsers):

		bsdconfig @PROGRAM_NAME@ | dot -Tsvg -o bsdconfig.svg

		NOTE: Requires `graphics/graphviz' from ports/packages.

	View the above-rendered SVG file using your favorite X11-based viewer:

		gimmage bsdconfig.svg

			NOTE: Requires `graphics/gimmage' from ports/packages.

		or

		gthumb bsdconfig.svg

			NOTE: Image is scaled to fit window on launch.
			NOTE: Requires `graphics/gthumb' from ports/packages.

		or

		gqview bsdconfig.svg

			NOTE: Requires `graphics/gqview' from ports/packages.

		or

		gx bsdconfig.svg

			NOTE: Image is scaled to fit window on launch.
			NOTE: Requires `graphics/gx' from ports/packages.

		or

		eog bsdconfig.svg

			NOTE: Requires `graphics/eog' from ports/packages.

	Render dot(1) output as PostScript print output consisting of multiple
	US-Letter sized pages that can be assembled into a large poster (using
	traditional tools such as scissors and tape):

		bsdconfig @PROGRAM_NAME@ | dot -Teps -o bsdconfig.eps
		poster -v -mLet -s1 -o bsdconfig.ps bsdconfig.eps

		NOTE: Change "-s1" above to "-s0.5" to halve the size of the
		      poster or "-s2", for example, to double the poster size.

		NOTE: Requires both `graphics/graphviz' and `print/poster' from
		      ports/packages.

	Render dot(1) output as PostScript scaled to fit on a poster consisting
	of 2x-wide and 4x-tall US-Letter sized pages:

		bsdconfig @PROGRAM_NAME@ | dot -Teps -o bsdconfig.eps
		poster -v -mLet -p2x4Letter -o bsdconfig.ps bsdconfig.eps

		NOTE: Requires both `graphics/graphviz' and `print/poster' from
		      ports/packages.

	View the above-rendered PostScript poster using X11:

		gsview bsdconfig.ps

			NOTE: Requires `print/gsview' from ports/packages.

		or

		convert bsdconfig.ps bsdconfig.pdf
		xpdf bsdconfig.pdf

			NOTE: Requires both `graphics/ImageMagick' and
			      `graphics/xdpf' from ports/packages.

			NOTE: The converted PDF file is not suitable for
			      printing due to loss of quality during the
			      conversion process.

	Print the above-rendered PostScript poster:

		lpr -h bsdconfig.ps

		NOTE: Requires configuration of a printer in `/etc/printcap'.

	Extract each page of the poster into a separate PNG file:

		gs -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sPAPERSIZE=letter \
		   -dTextAlphaBits=4 -dGraphicsAlphaBits=4 \
		   -sDEVICE=png16m -sOutputFile=bsdconfig%03d.png \
		   bsdconfig.ps

		NOTE: Requires `print/ghostscript9' from ports/packages.

		NOTE: The converted PNG files are not suitable for printing
		      due to loss of quality during the conversion process.

	Extract a single page of the poster into a separate PostScript file for
	printing individual pages from the command-line:

		psselect 1 bsdconfig.ps bsdconfig-page1.ps
		lpr -h bsdconfig-page1.ps

		NOTE: Change "1" to "2" for the second page, ad-infinitum.
		NOTE: Requires `print/psutils-letter' from ports/packages.
