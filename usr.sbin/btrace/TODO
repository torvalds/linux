Missing feature:

- Option "-c command" to run `command' and use its PID as filter.

Missing language features:

- if/else
- `args', tracepoint arguments support (requires kernel work)
- str(args->buf, args->count)

Improvements:

- rewrite stmt_printf() to not use strings internally
- look at collision in map hash
