.Sh NAME
.Nm crontab
.Nd tables for driving cron
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A
.Nm
file contains instructions to the
.Xr cron 8
daemon of the general form:
.Dq at these times on these dates run this command .
There may be a system
.Nm
and each user may have their own
.Nm .
Commands in any given
.Nm
will be
executed either as the user who owns the
.Nm
or, in the case of the system
.Nm crontab ,
as the user specified on the command line.
.Pp
While a
.Nm
is a text file, it is not intended to be directly edited.
Creation, modification, and removal of a
.Nm
should be done using
.Xr crontab 1 .
.Pp
Blank lines, leading spaces, and tabs are ignored.
Lines whose first non-space character is a pound sign
.Pq Ql #
are comments, and are ignored.
Note that comments are not allowed on the same line as
.Xr cron 8
commands, since
they will be taken to be part of the command.
Similarly, comments are not
allowed on the same line as environment variable settings.
.Pp
An active line in a
.Nm
is either an environment variable setting or a
.Xr cron 8
command.
.Pp
Environment variable settings create the environment
any command in the
.Nm
is run in.
An environment variable setting is of the form:
.Pp
.Dl name = value
.Pp
The spaces around the equal sign
.Pq Ql =
are optional, and any subsequent non-leading spaces in
.Ar value
will be part of the value assigned to
.Ar name .
The
.Ar value
string may be placed in quotes
.Pq single or double , but matching
to preserve leading or trailing blanks.
.Pp
Lines in the system
.Nm
have six fixed fields, an optional flags field, and a command, in the form:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Ar minute
.Ar hour
.Ar day-of-month
.Ar month
.Ar day-of-week
.Ar user
.Op Ar flags
.Ar command
.Ed
.Pp
While lines in a user
.Nm
have five fixed fields, an optional flags field, and a command, in the form:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Ar minute
.Ar hour
.Ar day-of-month
.Ar month
.Ar day-of-week
.Op Ar flags
.Ar command
.Ed
.Pp
Fields are separated by blanks or tabs.
The command may be one or more fields long.
The allowed values for the fields are:
.Bl -column "day-of-month" "allowed values" -offset indent
.It Sy field Ta Sy allowed values
.It Ar minute Ta *, ~, or 0\(en59
.It Ar hour Ta *, ~, or 0\(en23
.It Ar day-of-month Ta *, ~, or 1\(en31
.It Ar month Ta *, ~, 1\(en12, or a name (see below)
.It Ar day-of-week Ta *, ~, 0\(en7, or a name (0 or 7 is Sunday)
.It Ar user Ta a valid username
.It Op Ar flags Ta runtime flags, denoted with '-'
.It Ar command Ta text
.El
.Pp
Lists are allowed.
A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated by commas.
For example,
.Dq 1,2,5,9
or
.Dq 0\(en4,8\(en12 .
.Pp
Ranges of numbers are allowed.
Ranges are two numbers separated with a hyphen.
The specified range is inclusive.
For example,
8\(en11 for an
.Ar hour
entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and 11.
.Pp
A random value for a field may be obtained using the
.Ql ~
character.
A value is generated every time the tab is loaded.
On its own,
it denotes a random value appropriate for the field.
It can also be used in a range to make the interval more specific.
If either of the numbers in a range are omitted,
the appropriate limit (low or high) for that field will be used.
For example, both
.Dq 0~30
and
.Dq ~30
in the
.Ar minute
field would result in a random value between 0 and 30.
.Pp
Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges.
Following a range with
.No / Ns Ar number
specifies skips of
.Ar number
through the range.
For example,
.Dq 0\(en23/2
can be used in the
.Ar hour
field to specify command execution every other hour.
Steps are also permitted after an asterisk, so to say
.Dq every two hours ,
just use
.Dq */2 .
A step value after a random range will execute the command at a random
offset less than the step size.
For example, to avoid a thundering herd at the top and bottom of the hour,
.Dq 0~59/30
.Po
or simply
.Dq ~/30
.Pc
can be used in the
.Ar minute
field to specify that command execution happen twice an hour at
consistent intervals.
.Pp
An asterisk
.Pq Ql *
is short form for a range of all allowed values.
.Pp
Names can be used in the
.Ar month
and
.Ar day-of-week
fields.
Use the first three letters of the particular
day or month (case doesn't matter).
Ranges or lists of names are not allowed.
.Pp
Some
.Ar flags
relating to process operation can be provided before the
.Ar command
field.
Flags are denoted with '-' and may be combined.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n Ar command
No mail is sent after a successful run.
The execution output will only be mailed if the command exits with a non-zero
exit code.
The
.Fl n
option is an attempt to cure potentially copious volumes of mail coming from
.Xr cron 8 .
.It Fl q Ar command
Execution will not be logged.
.It Fl s Ar command
Only a single instance of
.Ar command
will be run concurrently.
Additional instances of
.Ar command
will not be scheduled until the earlier one completes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar command
field (the rest of the line) is the command to be
run.
The entire command portion of the line, up to a newline or %
character, will be executed by
.Pa /bin/sh
or by the shell
specified in the
.Ev SHELL
variable of the
.Nm crontab .
Percent signs
.Pq Ql %
in the command, unless escaped with a backslash
.Pq Ql \e ,
will be changed into newline characters, and all data
after the first
.Ql %
will be sent to the command as standard input.
.Pp
Commands are executed by
.Xr cron 8
when the
.Ar minute ,
.Ar hour ,
and
.Ar month
fields match the current time,
.Em and
when at least one of the two day fields
.Po Ar day-of-month
or
.Ar day-of-week Pc ,
match the current time.
.Pp
Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified by two
fields \(em
.Ar day-of-month
and
.Ar day-of-week .
If both fields are restricted (i.e. aren't *),
the command will be run when
.Em either
field matches the current time.
For example,
.Pp
.Dl 30 4 1,15 * 5
.Pp
would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the 1st and 15th of each
month, plus every Friday.
.Pp
Instead of the first five fields, one of eight special strings may appear:
.Bl -column "@midnight" "meaning" -offset indent
.It Sy string Ta Sy meaning
.It @reboot Ta Run once, at startup.
.It @yearly Ta Run every January 1 (0 0 1 1 *).
.It @annually Ta The same as @yearly.
.It @monthly Ta Run the first day of every month (0 0 1 * *).
.It @weekly Ta Run every Sunday (0 0 * * 0).
.It @daily Ta Run every midnight (0 0 * * *).
.It @midnight Ta The same as @daily.
.It @hourly Ta Run every hour, on the hour (0 * * * *).
