	- Fix #414: XoT interoperability with BIND and Knot
	- Fix #421: old-main can quit before the reload process received        
	  from old-main that it is done on the reload_listener pipe.            
	  Thanks Otto Retter. 
	- Fix whitespace in comment.
	- Fix #424: Stalled updates after corrupt transfer.

4.11.0
================
FEATURES:
	- Support reloading configuration on SIGHUP.
	- Fix #383: log timestamps in ISO8601 format with timezone.
	  This adds the option `log-time-iso: yes` that logs in ISO8601
	  format.
	- Updated cookie secrets management.
	  The default cookie secret file location can be set at compile time
	  with the --with-cookiesecretsfile=path option to configure. The
	  default location is changed to {dbdir}/cookiesecrets.txt. The
	  previous default location will be checked at startup when there is
	  no cookie secrets file at the new default location.
	  A staging cookie can now also be configured in the configuration
	  file and secrets configured in the configuration file now take
	  precedence over those read from file.
	  All DNS related setting in the configuration file will be reevaluated
	  and effectuated after nsd-control reconfig.
	- Merge #398: RFC 9660 The DNS Zone Version (ZONEVERSION) Option
	- Merge #406: ohttp and tls-supported-groups SvcParam suppor
	- Merge #408: NINFO, RKEY, RESINFO, WALLET, CLA and TA RR types
	- Merge #409: Writing of NSAP-PTR, GPOS and HIP RR types
	- Merge #407: Better balanced verbosity levels for logging.

	- Fix title underline and declaration after statement warnings.
	- Add cross platform freebsd, openbsd and netbsd to github ci.
	- Update simdzone to include fix for netbsd double bswap declarations,
	  and also semantic checks for DS and ZONEMD. And CFLAGS has -march
	  prepended to fix detection.
	- Merge #376: Point the user towards tcpdump for logging individual
	  queries.
	- Track $INCLUDEs in zone files.
	- Fix ci to update macos-12 to the macos-15 runner image.
	- Merge #390: Apply non-xfr tasks before xfr tasks.
	  This fixes an issue where non-xfr tasks are lost when they are
	  batch processed together with non-xfr tasks.
	  This merge also changes that notifies are passed on from the serve
	  processes to the xfrd directly instead of via main. This was
	  necessary to allow applying the non-xfr tasks without forking a
	  backup-main for the sole purpose of forwarding notifies.
	- Merge #391: Update copyright lines (in version output).
	- Fix #392: Inconsistent documentation about control-interface.
	- Merge #395: Explain the zonefile example better.
	- Merge #394: Fix the path to use doc/manual/.

	- Merge #358: Fix Hurd build error due to log_err.
	- Update simdzone to fix detection of AVX2 support.

4.10.0
================
FEATURES:
	- Merge #278: Replace Flex+Bison based zone parser with simdzone.
	  Performance of loading zones and IXFRs is greatly improved by using
	  the simdzone project by NLnet Labs. The optimized presentation format
	  parser leverages SIMD instructions in modern CPUs to improve throughput.
	  Right now SSE4.2 and AVX2 instruction sets are supported, other
	  instruction sets will use the fallback implementation, which still is
	  a decent improvement over the Flex+Bison based parser.

BUG FIXES:
	- Fix that when the server truncates the pidfile, it does not follow
	  symbolic links.
	- Fix #317: nsd should not chown its PID file.
	- For #317: Modify nsd service script to stop NSD from creating a
	  pid file that systemd is not using.
	- Fix #324: Clarify the purpose of contrib/bug390.patch.
	- Fix IXFR requests upstream for zones with a long name. Thanks for
	  the report to Yuuki Wakisaka from Internet Initiative Japan Inc.
	- Unit test for dname subdomain test used by xfrd-tcp.c.
	- Fix #329: TCP accept queues number.
	- Fix that the reload handler for sigchild uses signal_add, and
	  also that the signal handler is restored when done.
	- Fix that when server verify is done it resets the sigchild handler.
	- Fix makedist.sh for simdzone inclusion.
	- Fix makedist.sh to remove simdzone git tracking information and
	  scripting temporaries from tarball.
	- Fix error output of makedist.sh.
	- Use simdzone version with name parser fix.
	- Bump simdzone version to fix OpenBSD build issues.
	- Bump simdzone to include minor fixes.

4.9.1
================
BUG FIXES:
	- Use rooted temporary path in makedist.sh.

4.9.0
================
FEATURES:
	- Merge #315: Allow SOA apex queries to otherwise with allow-query
	  protected zones for clients matching a provide-xfr rule, because
	  clients that are allowed to transfer the zone need to be able to
	  query SOA at the apex preceding the actual transfer.
	- Merge #304: Support for Catalog zones version "2" as specified in
	  RFC 9432. Both the consumer as well as the producer role are
	  implemented, but only a single catalog consumer zone is allowed.
	  The "coo" property, only relevant with multiple catalog consumer,
	  is therefore not supported. The "group" property is supported.
	  Have a look at the nsd.conf man page for details on how to
	  configure and use catalog zones.

BUG FIXES:
	- Fix to sync the tests script file common.sh.
	- Update test script file common.sh.
	- Fix #306: Missing AC_SUBST(dbdir) breaks installation with 4.8.0.
	- Fix for #306: Create directory for xfrd.state and zone.list files
	  in make install.

	  man page.
	- Fix #308: Deprecate "multi-master-check" in favour of
	  "multi-primary-check".
	- Merge #309: More RFC 8499 compliance.
	- Fix control-reconfig-xfrd test for zonestatus primary that is
	  printed by nsd-control zonestatus.
	- Move acx_nlnetlabs.m4 to version 47, with crypt32 check.
	- Move acx_nlnetlabs.m4 to version 48, with ssp and getaddrinfo
	  include check.
	- Fix #313: nsd 4.8 stats with implausible spikes.
	- Fix compile with memclean for xfrd nsd.db close.
	- In xfrd del secondary zone, the timer could perhaps have
	  event_added, and if so, it would not be event_del if a tcp connection
	  is active at the time. This could cause the libevent event lists
	  to fail. Also fix to make sure to set event_added for the
	  nsd-control ssl nonblocking handshake and check event_added there
	  too, for extra certainty.
	- Merge #316: Fix to reap defunct children by the reload process that
	  emerged when some serve child processes were still serving TCP
	  request while the others had already quit, while the reload process
	  was waiting for the signal from the backup/old main process that all
	  children exited.
	- Fix (also from Merge #316) to reap exited children more frequently
	  from server main loop for processes that exited during reload, but
	  missed the initial reaping at start of the main loop because they
	  took somewhat longer to exit.
	- Fix timing sensitivity in ixfr_outsync test.
	- Test if debug is available in do-tests.
	- Enforce timeout from NSD in ixfr_gone test.
	- Update expressions in ixfr_and_restart test.
	- Make algorithm explicit in control-repattern test.
	- Switch algorithm to hmac-256 for testplan_mess test.
	- Replace multiple strcat and strcpy by snprintf.

4.8.0
================
FEATURES:
	- Merge #281: Proxy protocol. An implementation of PROXYv2 for NSD.
	  It can be configured with proxy-protocol-port: portnum with the
	  port number of the interface on which proxy traffic is handled.
	  The interface can support proxy traffic for UDP, TCP and TLS.
	- Merge #301: improve the logging of ixfr fallbacks to axfr.
	- Merge #305: faster stats. Statistics can be gathered while a reload
	  is in progress.
BUG FIXES:
	- Merge #282: Improve nsd.conf man page.
	- Fix unused but set variable warning.
	- Fix #283: Compile failure in remote.c when --disable-bind8-stats
	  and --without-ssl are specified.

	  function and fix drop_updates, rr-test and xfr_update tests.
	- Fix unit test kill_from_pidfile function for nonexistent files
	  because the argument is evaluated before the test expression.
	- Fix rr-test to also convert the contents of the just written output
	  file.
	- Fix test set to remove -f nsd.db and rm nsd.db commands.
	- Fix test set to remove difffile option.

	- Merge #263: Add bash autocompletion script for nsd-control.
	- Fix #267: Allow unencrypted local operation of nsd-control.
	- Merge #269 from Fale: Add systemd service unit.
	- Fix #271: DNSTAP over TCP, with dnstap-ip: "127.0.0.1@3333".
	- dnstap over TLS, default enabled. Configured with the
	  options dnstap-tls, dnstap-tls-server-name, dnstap-tls-cert-bundle,

BUG FIXES:
	- Fix static analyzer reports on ixfrcreate temp file.
	- Fixup wrong ixfrcreate fread return check.

4.5.0
================
FEATURES:
	- Merge PR #209: IXFR out
	  This adds IXFR out functionality to NSD. NSD can copy IXFRs from
	  upstream to downstream clients, or create IXFRs from zonefiles.
	  The options store-ixfr: yes and create-ixfr: yes can be used to
	  turn this on. Default is turned off. The options ixfr-number and
	  ixfr-size can be used to tune the number of IXFR transfers and
	  total data size stored. This is configured per zone, the IXFRs
	  are served to the hosts that are allowed to perform zone transfers.
	  And if TSIG is configured, signed with the same key. The content
	  is stored to file if a zonefile is configured for the zone, in
	  the zonefile.ixfr and zonefile.ixfr.2, .. files. They contain
	  readable text format. The number of IXFRs is num.rixfr in
	  statistics output, also per zone if per zone statistics are enabled.
	  If offline, nsd-checkzone -i can create ixfr files.
	  NSD already supports requesting IXFRs, this addition allows NSD
	  to serve IXFR transfers to clients.
	  NSD stops responding with NOTIMPL to IXFR requests, also for zones
	  that do not have IXFR enabled. The clients gets a full zone reply
	  or a status reply if the serial is up to date.
BUG FIXES:
	- Fix code analyzer zero divide warning.
	- Fix code analyzer large value with assertion.
	- Fix another code analyzer zero divide warning.
	- Fix code analyzer warning about uninitialized temp storage in loop.
	- Fix spelling error in comment in svcbparam_lookup_key.
	- Update cirrus script FreeBSD version.

4.4.0
================
FEATURES:
	- Merge #193: Lower memory usage of the XFRD process by default.
	  Instead of preallocating all elements, they are allocated when used.
	  There are options for managing the memory usage, defaults are the
	  same as before. xfrd-tcp-max sets the number of sockets for tcp
	  connections that xfrd can make to download zone contents. And
	  xfrd-tcp-pipeline the number of simultaneous transfers over the
	  same connection.
BUG FIXES:
	- Fix #200: nsd-checkzone succeeds even with incorrect serial in SOA
	  record.
	- Merge #204 from jonathangray: correct some spelling mistakes.
	- Fix to change file mode before changing file owner for the
	  nsd-control unix socket file.

4.3.8
================
FEATURES:
	- Merge #185 by cesarkuroiwa: Mutual TLS.
	- Set default for answer-cookie to no. Because in server deployments
	  with mixed server software, a default of yes causes issues.

	- Fix to compile with OpenSSL 3.0.0beta2.
	- Fix configure detection of SSL_CTX_set_security_level.
	- Fix deprecated functions use from openssl 3.0.0beta2.

	- zonefiles-write option in nsd.conf, enabled when database is "".
	  The server writes changed zonefiles to disk every hour.

	- include: "foo/nsd.d/*.conf" works, wildcard glob on includes.
	- nsd shuts down during init process if given signal.
	- log-time-ascii option, default yes, with readable timestamp in log.
	- nsd-control addzone reports if zone already exists.
	- Fix #564: add nsd-checkzone tool to check zonefile correctness.

	  for them.  Fix makes it so there is no very deep string of
	  process parents.
	- Remove .LP after .SH in man pages.


4.0.3
================
BUG FIXES:
	- Fix nsd.db unclean close check.  Previous databases are considered
	  unclean by the code and are created anew.
	- Adds nsd.db larger than 400Tb check for sanity. Also test if
	  filesize as documented in the file is correct.
	- nsd waits for tasks to complete on stop, prevents nsd.db corruption.
	- fix to not delete tmpdir too early in shutdown process.
	- disabled udb checking functionality that made it very slow,
	  this was enabled when enable-checking was turned on.


4.0.2
================
FEATURES:
	- Return REFUSED for queries to non-hosted zones.

BUG FIXES:
	- Fix expired zones to give SERVFAIL, also when parent zone loaded.
	- documented nsd-control zonestatus output in nsd-control manpage.
	- remove mention of nsdc from nsd-checkconf manpage.
	- Disabled recvmmsg and sendmmsg usage by default because kernel
	  versions have implementation issues: ipv6 ignored, security issues.
	- Detect libevent2 install automatically by configure, and use
	  event2 header files if necessary.
	- Fix #551: change Regent to Copyright holder in the LICENSE,
	  to match the definition on opensource.org for the BSD License.
	- Fix #552: zonefile loads on nsd-control reconfig when the name
	  of the file has changed.
	- Fix leak of zone name after zonefile read and fix malloc too
	  large that would be leaked in the radix tree.
	- Fix from 3.2: make SOA RDATA comparisons in XFR more lenient (only
	  check serial).
	- Fix that NSD will delete and recreate not-clean-closed databases.


4.0.1
================
FEATURES:
	- recognizes ip-address and interface as synonyms for convenience.
	- Support for EUI48 and EUI64 RR types enabled by default (RFC 7043).
	- Support for CAA RRtype (RFC 6844).
	- NSID can be set with "ascii_somestring" in ascii.
	
BUG FIXES:
	- Fix xfrd when zone transfer TCP contains zero length packets.
	- Fix for NSEC3 zones where parent zone is co-hosted, also NSEC3,
	  because AXFRs overwrote nsec3 administration in the child zone.
   	- Fix that bad IXFR updates do not result in double SOA records,
	  and that an AXFR is started (attempted) when the zone state seems
	  to be inconsistent with the master's zone state.
	- Log ip address for sendto and sendmmsg failures.
	- Fix segfaults after read of zones with rr type WKS from zonefile.
	- Seed PRNG for openssl at start of daemon, fixes SSL connection issue.

	- (same as in 3.2.16): fix wildcard cname to nxdomain repeated rrset.
	- (same as in 3.2.16): Bugfix #542: Match RRSIG TTL with SOA TTL in
	  negative response.
	- Check if configure in srcdir collides with outofdir build.
	- Fix #546:  output format errors in nsd_munin_ (Thanks Tom Hendrikx).
	- Fix printout of high-chars in TXT on NetBSD.

4.0.0	NSD 4.0
===============
FEATURES:
	- documented in doc/NSD-4-features. Change configuration without
	  restart, direct nameserver control with nsd-control, support a
	  higher number of zones. Higher performance (compared to NSD3).
	- nsdc is gone. Use kill -HUP for reload (also checks if zonefiles
	  have changed and rereads them), and kill -TERM for quit. Or use
	  nsd-control for detailed control.
	- cron job for nsdcpatch is gone. nsd-control write creates zonefiles.
	- nsd.db has a new format that compacts itself when it is changed,
	  thus nsdc patch is no longer necessary.
	- nsd.db is memory mapped, NSD needs (part of) that mmap in ram.
	- tcp-count can go above 1000; epoll/kqueue support with libevent.
	- nsd-control reconfig for updates with no restart (zones, keys, ..)
	- nsd-control-setup to create keys for nsd-control (enable nsd-control
	  with remote-control: yes in nsd.conf).
	- the NSD 3 feature of special zone stats are not ported to 4 yet,
	  as it would entail a complete reimplementation of the feature.
FEATURES (incremental from BETA5):
	- configure --disable-recvmmsg for compat with older Linux kernels,
	  by default it autodetects support in the kernel on the buildmachine.
	- Fix time at 2038, uint32s changed to time_t, support 64bit time_t.
	- Fix use of 32bit time, for 2038, thanks to Theo de Raadt for patch.
BUG FIXES (incremental from BETA5):
	- Bugfix #518 Incorrect RRL prefix length option names in nsd.conf
	  man page from Ville Mattila.
	- Fix that xfrd, and nsd-control, does not stop responding when reload
	  errors out. The pid is sent like it should by server_main.
	- Fix that EOF in quoted string error does not cause reload to exit.
	- Fixup errors from the stack code checker.
	- Removed use of random when arc4random is available. Thus, random
	  and srandom are then not linked with the executable.
	- Fix segfault with no logfile and chroot (Thanks Patrik Lundin).

4.0.0b5   BETA 5 release of NSD 4.0
==================================
FEATURES:
	- Optimizations for startup, qps and tcp speed, beta bug fixes and
	  merge with code changes with NSD 3.2.16.
	- nsd-mem tool (make nsd-mem) to estimate memory usage.
	- Same as NSD 3.2.16: --enable-draft-rrtypes(EUI48, EUI64), rr-slip,
	  rrl-ipv[46]-prefix-length, ip-transparent config options.
	- configure option --disable-flto.
	- improved RRL logging (query details that caused blockage).
	- nsd-control status prints out ratelimit if ratelimit is enabled.
	- nsd-control verbosity prints out verbosity level without argument.
	- Fix #491: pick program name (of executable) as syslog identity.
	- printout percentage for long activities (to log).  After about 5
	  seconds have passed.
BUG FIXES:
	- The same fixes up to NSD 3.2.16.
	- Fix that old zonefile does not override newer AXFR for slave zones.
	- Nicer printout of notify.
	- Fix tcp zonetransfer pipeline lookup function.
	- Fix compile on bigendian netbsd alpha.
	- Fixup the growth and shrinkage of nsd.db.  This should use less
	  calls to remap and change the file and mmap size.
	- notify information is logged at correct verbosity level, 1.
	- Fix memory statistics in nsd_munin_.
	- faster nsec3 updates.
	- Fixup contrib/bug390.patch for 4.0.0b4.
	- remove leak of nsec3.
	- allocate radixtree in region for small (5%) total savings and
	  about 15% savings in the radixtree itself (due to many small alloc
	  savings in region).
	- Patch from Lukas Wunner that makes nsd.conf include files work
	  inside chroot/etc environments on repattern and reconfig.
	- Fix race on exit of nsd, for restarts, so that the pidfile-pid
	  process waits until port53 has been closed before exiting.
	- Patch from Lukas Wunner that makes chroot more consistent.
	  Make all paths absolute with the chrootdir in front, or use
	  an absolute zonesdir with other paths relative to that.
	- Fix segfault on repeated reconfigs, double free of zone apex name.
	- Fix zone parser allocations are put in the db region.
	- Fix memory leak in zone parser for txt record.
	- Optimizations: -O3 if possible (user can override CFLAGS), udp
	  buffers are set to 1m by default (if socket options exist),
	  use recvmmsg and sendmmsg, or only recvmmsg, or recvfrom.
	- nsd.db 12% smaller, no nsec3 hash storage.  Also ups udb version
	  because of the format change.  The nsd.db is recreated when a 
	  different version number is detected on startup.
	- Fix region-allocator for speedup of load and change of large data.
	- Increase tcpbacklog default to 256 (silently capped to 128 on BSD).
	  For remote control keep it at 16, it has less TCP load.
	  It does not actually increase TCP performance (some except), but
	  reduces connection loss when there is a spike in TCP connections.
	- unlink xfr file if transfer is stopped, timeouted or interrupted.
	  And unlink xfr file in progress when the zone is deleted.

4.0.0b4   BETA 4 release of NSD 4.0
==================================
BUG FIXES:
	- remove -fwhole-program gcc flag usage.  We cannot reliably detect

	- remove printout of "bad transfer" to the log for notimpl.
	- printout log less verbosely, not every axfr packet.
	- RRL documented in nsd.conf.sample
	- Fix is_apex flag for zones read from udb.
	- Fix that nsec3 zones are precompiled when read from udb.  This
	  caused assertion failures.
	- Less printout of 'bad transfer'.
	- Fix AXFR of NSEC3 slave zone.
	- Fix that old zonefile does not override newer AXFR for slave zones.
	- Nicer printout of notify on verbosity 2.

4.0.0b3   BETA 3 release of NSD 4.0
==================================
BUG FIXES:
	- applied patch from Robin Hack to remove double pid file truncation.
	- repattern is called reconfig (because most config options are
	  picked up, except for superuser options (chroot, logfile, port))
	- document that the zonefile attribute can be empty.
	- documented that the _implicit_ pattern names are used internally.
	- Added zonefiles-check option, default yes, check mtimes of zone files
	  on sighup and startup (from Robin Hack).
	- Fix spurious assertion failure for some rrl blocks.
	- Tabs and spaces nicer in nsd.conf.sample.
	- List libevent in README.
	- Fix configure for gentoo gcc and headers.
	- do-ip4 and do-ip6 nsd.conf options just like unbound.
	- do not leave task files in /tmp if nsd fails to startup because
	  of file permissions.
	- create xfrdir on make install (does not remove on make uninstall,
	  because this could be /tmp).
	- Fix segv if xfrdir does not exit.
	- log ip address with tcp failure.
	- Fix time calculation of zone transfer.

=================================

FEATURES:
	- New config option "ip-transparent:" to allow NSD to bind to
	  non local addresses. Default no.

	  are caused by delays in learning working PMTU when communicating
	  through a tunnel.
	- Bugfix #496: Support for EUI48 and EUI64 RR types. Experimental,
	  turned off by default. Enable with --enable-draft-rrtypes.
	- New config option "rrl-slip:" to set the average number of
	  packets discarded before we send back a truncated response.
	- New config option "rrl-ipv4-prefix-length:" and
	  "rrl-ipv6-prefix-length:" to set the prefix lengths.
	- Improved RRL logging, also print triggering query src address and
	  QTYPE.
	- Provide RRL documentation in nsd.conf.sample.

BUG FIXES:
	- Bugfix #357: Parent process waits until children closed down
	  sockets, to prevent NSD failing to bind to sockets when restarting.
	- Bugfix #487: lookup3.c determine endianness for BSD systems.
	- Bugfix #491: pick program name (0th argument) as syslog identity.
	- Bugfix #494: Exit with return code 1 if socket code fails.
	- RRtypes ASFDB, RP, RT should not compress dnames.
	- Fix outgoing-interface: Don't fail if family is IPv6 but
	  only IPv4 outgoing-interface is set, or vice versa.
	- RRtypes ASFDB, RP, RT should not compress dnames.
	- Check that zone directory is within chroot directory.
	- Better XFR checking, fallback to AXFR (if allowed) if three
	  malformed XFR packets have been seen.


3.2.15
=================================

FEATURES:
	- Support for ILNP RR types: NID, L32, L64, LP (RFC6742).
	- RRL, --enable-ratelimit at configure time and config options.
	- TSIG initialization only fails when there is no digest found
	  at all.

BUG FIXES:
	- Bugfix #478: Declaration after statement (for gcc 2.95).
	- Bugfix #483: Better error message in case of TSIG error.
	- Bugfix #485: TTL should not be greater than 2^31 - 1.
	- Fix RCODE when CNAME loop final answer does not exist, should
	  return NXDOMAIN as stated by RFC 6604.
	- Fix --disable-full-prehash bug, where after multiple incoming
	  IXFRs, NSEC3 can be removed unjustified.

3.2.14
================

FEATURES:
	- TCP writev support.

BUG FIXES:
	- Fix build on OpenBSD (thanks Oliver Peter).
	- Prioritize notify sender for requesting XFR (thanks Ilya Bakulin).
	- Fix crash in zonec if TXT string too long  (thanks Ilya Bakulin).
	- tzset before chroot for correct timezone (thanks Camiel Dobbelaar).
	- Fix --disable-full-prehash bug when nsdc patch happens while ixfr too,
	  it did not rehash the new database.
	- Bugfix #464: Conditionally define MAXHOSTNAMELEN.

3.2.13
================

BUG FIXES:
	- Fix for nsd-patch segfault if zone has been removed from nsd.conf
	  (thanks Ilya Bakulin).
	- Bugfix #460: man page correction - identity.
	- Bugfix #461: NSD child segfaults when asked for out-of-zone data
	  with --enable-zone-stats. [VU#517036 CVE-2012-2979]


3.2.12
================

BUG FIXES:
	- Fix for VU#624931 CVE-2012-2978: NSD denial of service 
	  vulnerability from non-standard DNS packet from any host
	  on the internet.
	  http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/CVE-2012-2978.txt


3.2.11
================

FEATURES:
	- Fallback to AXFR if IXFR is unknown at the primary. NSD considers
	  IXFR unknown at the primary if there is a negative response for the
	  IXFR RRtype. This does not override the value for
	  'allow-axfr-fallback'.
	- Allow for reading in new DNSKEY algorithm mnemonics (RFC5155,
	  RFC5702, RFC5933, and RFC6605 (ECDSA)).
	- Zone statistics, enable with --enable-zone-stats. This stores the
	  BIND8 stats per zone in a configurable statistics file. This option
	  does not scale and should therefore not be enabled when serving
	  many zones.
	- Support for TLSA RRtype (DANE).

BUG FIXES:
	- Fix for qtype ANY for a wildcard domain in NSEC signed zone: Don't
	  add the wildcard domain NSEC into the answer section. Instead,
	  put the wildcard expanded NSEC into the answer section and keep the
	  wildcard domain NSEC in the authority section.
	- Fix for accept spinning reported by OpenBSD.
	- Fix restart failed due to bad ixfr packet because of zone removed
	  from nsd.conf.
	- Bugfix #453: typo in nsdc man page.

OPERATIONAL NOTES:
	- NSD uses the query name for dname compression again (Fix #235 
	  had as side effect that this didn't happen anymore and is hereby
	  undone).


3.2.10
================

BUG FIXES:
	- Bugfix #421: Truncate pidfile on shutdown, before unlink.
	- Bugfix #423: Fix slow zone transfer processing due to
	  'Fix is_existing flag for ENT' bugfix.
	- Fix bug #430: segfault when MAX_INTERFACES set to more than 65K.
	- Fix configure.ac strptime check for gcc 4.6.2, acx_nlnetlabs update.


3.2.9
================

FEATURES:
	- Minimize responses to reduce truncation: NSD will only add optional
	  records to the authority and additional sections when the response
	  size does not exceed the minimal response size.

	  The minimal response size is 512 (no-EDNS), 1480 (EDNS/IPv4),
	  1220 (EDNS/IPv6), or the advertized EDNS buffer size if that is
	  smaller than the EDNS default. 

	  The feature is enabled by default. You can disable it by configuring 
	  NSD with --disable-minimal-responses.

	- Less NSEC3 prehashing. This will make NSD handle zone transfers
	  faster, but will decrease the performance of NXDOMAIN and wildcard
	  NODATA responses. Full prehashing is enabled by default. If you want
	  less NSEC3 prehashing, configure NSD with --disable-full-prehash.
	  Thanks Secure64 for the patch.

BUG FIXES:
	- Bugfix #302: nsd accepts XFR but refuses to re-read the slave zone.
	- Bugfix #365: set patch style and zonec verbose for nsdc.
	- First step of bug #369: RRSIG DNSKEY sets zone to be treated DNSSEC.
	- Bugfix #375: typos in nsd.conf.5.
	- Bugfix #381: Binary escaped and transfers.
	- Bugfix #397: Don't allow relative domain names as origin in $INCLUDE
	  directives.
	- Fix printout of IPSECKEY by nsd-patch.
	- Fix is_existing flag for ENT when domain that has a shared ENT
	  is deleted by IXFR. (ENT == Empty Non-Terminal)
	- Fix bug if the zonefile is changed for a secondary but stored
	  transfers are applied, and stop it from applying ixfr to empty zone.
	  The zone is flagged with error and AXFR-ed.
	- Fix to have no authority NS set processing for CNAMEs.
	- Fix nsd-checkconf to check tsig algorithms properly.
	- Set the AA bit on responses that have an authoritative CNAME.
	- Fix denial of existence response for empty non-terminal that looks
	  like a NSEC3-only domain (but has data below it).

OPERATIONAL NOTES:
	- nsd.db version number increased because NSD 3.2.7 and earlier
	  zonec is not compatible due to the TXT strings change. Please
	  run nsdc rebuild before running NSD 3.2.9 and later versions.


3.2.8
=============

BUG FIXES:
	- Do setusercontext() before chroot(), otherwise login.conf etc. are
	  required inside chroot.
	- Bugfix #216: Fix leak of compressiontable when the domain table increases
	  in size.
	- Bugfix #348: Don't include header/library path if OpenSSL is in /usr
	- Bugfix #350: Refused notifies should log client ip.
	- Bugfix #352: Fix hard coded paths in man pages.
	- Bugfix #354: The realclean target deletes a bit too much.	
	- Bugfix #357, make xfrd quit with many zones.
	- Bugfix #362: outgoing-interface and v4 vs. v6 leads to spurious
	  warning messages.
	- Bugfix #363: nsd-checkconf -v does not print outgoing-interface ok.
	- Bugfix: nsd-checkconf -o outgoing-interface omits NOKEY.

OPERATIONAL NOTES:
	- Use 'make clean' to clean up files that make created.
	- Use 'make realclean' to also clean up files that were generated by
	  running ./configure.
	- Use 'make devclean' to also clean up autoconf, autoheader files.

3.2.7
=============

BUG FIXES:
	- Bugfix #253: Don't put NS RRs in a response with QTYPE=DS.	
	- Bugfix #320: use arcrandom(4) for QID generation if available.
	- Bugfix #328: nsd-checkconf overrun.
	- Bugfix #343: nsdc update fix.
	- Bugfix #347: Wrong NSEC3 returned for nodata response QTYPE=DS no delegation.
	- Bugfix: Allow for huge amount of strings in TXT (and other) records.
	- Bugfix: nsdc can now deal with tsig algorithms other than hmac-md5.
	- Fixed several parts in the documentation, including #306, #345.

3.2.6
=============

BUG FIXES:
	- Bugfix #314: correctly print NSEC next field, escape spaces and
	  fix label overflows.

FEATURES:
	- Expand command line option '-a' and config option 'ip-address:'
	  with port number.

OPERATIONAL NOTES:
	- Configure options --disable-dnssec, --disable-nsid, --disable-tsig
	  are removed.
	- Configure option --max-interfaces is renamed to --max-ips.

3.2.5
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- NSD will not start if chroot is configured, but changing root is
	  not possible (it used to ignore the badly configured chroot).
	- Make use of the more secure strl* functions.
	- Bugfix #303: spelling error.

FEATURES:
	- New option 'nsid:', to specify the NSID (Bugfix #298).
	- The default chroot can be set with --with-chroot=<dir>.
	  If not set, by default chroot will not be used (thanks Jakob Schlyter).
	- Optimized zonec and b64_pton compatibility code (thanks Martin Svec).
	- Optimized memory allocations. Use mmap/munmap instead of malloc/free.
		Experimental, by default off. Enable it at build time with
		--enable-mmap (thanks Martin Svec).

OPERATIONAL NOTES:
	- NSID support is now enabled by default.

3.2.4
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Bugfix #269: Additional C99 syntax.
	- Bugfix #276: Zonec prints debug data to stderr.
	- Bugfix #286: Document verbosity levels in nsd.conf manual page.
	- Bugfix #288: Ignore SIGHUP to child processes.
	- Fix typo in include file for setusercontext.

FEATURES:
	- Support DLV records.
	- New option 'tcp-query-count:', to limit the maximum number of
		DNS queries on a single tcp connection.
	- New option 'tcp-timeout:', to override the default tcp timeout.
		The default can also be set at build time, --with-tcp-timeout=<number>.
	- New option 'notify-retry:', to configure how many times NSD should retry
		a NOTIFY message.
	- New options 'ipv4-edns-size:' and 'ipv6-edns-size:'. to set your preferred
		EDNS buffer size.

OPERATIONAL NOTES:
	- UDP/IPv4 sockets have new options set that will disable the DF flag in IP
		packets.

3.2.3
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Bugfix #236: Allow RRs before the SOA in a zonefile.
	- Bugfix #249: Remove the C99 code.
	- Bugfix #253: Don't put NS RRs in a response with QTYPE=DNSKEY.
	- Bugfix #263: Make TSIG algorithm comparison case insensitive.
	- Bugfix #266: Build failed on systems without strptime.
	- Bugfix: install hickup.
	- Fix to use 4096 EDNS limit for IPv6 on Linux.

3.2.2
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Off-by-one buffer overflow fix while processing the QUESTION section.
	- Return BADVERS when NSD does not implement the VERSION level of the 
	  request, instead of 0x1<FORMERR>.
	- Bugfix #234.
	- Bugfix #235.
	- Reset 'error occurred' after notifying an error occurred at the $TTL or
		$ORIGIN directive (Otherwise, the whole zone is skipped because the
		error is reset after reading the SOA).
	- Minor bugfixes.

3.2.1
=============
OPERATIONAL NOTES:
	- NSD will now fallback to AXFR, only if the master does not support IXFR.
	- You can adjust nsdc patch to skip textfile patching. This will 
	  increase the patching process, but will not output to zonefiles 
	  anymore. By default, this is off.

BUG FIXES:
	- When configuring, don't do strptime test when cross-compiling.
	- Bug #230: Output non-error messages to stdout.
	- Better error message when ixfr.db old file format is read.
	- Bug #218: shared UDP query for all interfaces.
	- Bug #222: Remove bashism from nsdc script.
	- Nicer check for SHA-256 functionality.
	- Fixed some minor memory leaks that occurred on reload.
	- nsdc: check if a lockfile has not gone stale, when lock failed.
	- Bugfix strptime compatibility function

FEATURES:
	- New configuration option 'allow-afxr-fallback', "yes" by default. If
		set to "no", NSD will never do AXFR fallback, even if the master 
		does not support IXFR.
	- Allow file rotation on nsd.log.
	- The new nsd-patch options -s and -o allows you to skip writing 
		zonefiles and store the output directly to a database file, 
		respectively.

3.2.0
=============
OPERATIONAL NOTES:
	- Format of ixfr.db has changed. When you are planning an upgrade to the 
	  new NSD release, make sure to process the old ixfr.db before starting 
	  the new release (by running nsdc patch).
	- IXFR is transmitted over TCP by default instead of UDP. If you want to 
	  continue the use of IXFR/UDP, please modify your zone configuration 
	  file to:
		request-xfr: UDP 1.2.3.4 tsigkey
	  We strongly recommend to enable TSIG if you send IXFR over UDP.
	  When all masters fail to transmit IXFR/UDP, slave will fallback to 
		IXFR/TCP and eventually AXFR/TCP.
	- nsd-patch prints errors to stderr instead of stdout.

BUG FIXES:
	- Only normalize dnames in rdatas when rrtype is listed in RFC 4034, 
	  section 6.2: Canonical RR Form, following
	  draft-ietf-dnsext-dnssec-bis-updates (affects RRSIG and NSEC records).
	- Typo in zonec manpage.
	- Bugfix in log_finalize.
	- Fix race condition between nsdc patch and server reload.

FEATURES:
	- AXFR/TCP fallback in case of failing IXFR zone transfers.
	- RFC 4635: support for hmac-sha1 and hmac-sha256 TSIG algorithm 
		identifiers, "Bugfix #130".
	- Configure the source ip-address for notifies (master) and zone
		requests (slave) in nsd.conf, "Bugfix #148".
	- nsd-notify and nsd-xfer allow you to configure the outgoing 
		hostname and source port, in addition to the source address.
	- Additional debug and verbose log messages.

3.1.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Try to avoid race conditions with NSD reloading and nsdc running, 
		by writing pidfile before closing old parent process.
	- Fixed NSEC3 memory leak in the case NSEC3 is not needed.
	- Fixed some memory leaks that happened on error, mostly on
		zone transfer errors.
	- Bugfix #191: nsd-checkconf allowed only (max_interfaces-1) interfaces.

FEATURES:
	- The number of maximum interfaces allowed is configurable with
		--with-max_interfaces=<number> (thanks John Lightsey).

3.1.0
=============
OPERATIONAL NOTES:
	- Default locations of nsd.db, ixfr.db & xfrd.state are changed to
          the /var/db/nsd directory.

BUG FIXES:
	- Zone compiler gives more sane error messages when out of
	  diskspace and bug #172: when compiling single zone file.
	- Changed man pages format from mdoc to mansun, to support the Solaris OS.
	- Log tcp read error only when connection not reset by peer or when 
	  verbosity level is high.
	- RRs are compared without checking the TTL value.

FEATURES:
	- NSD is now NSEC3 enabled by default. You can disable it by configuring 
		NSD with --disable-nsec3.
	- Added "hide-version" configuration setting. Enabling this feature 
		stops NSD from answering to CHAOS class version requests.
	- Added bind2nsd 0.5.0 (http://bind2nsd.sourceforge.net) in contrib/.
	- Report source and zone for denied AXFR attempts.

3.0.8
=============
FEATURES:
	- Better logging for nsd-notify (show 'broken' zone)
	- Add configuration for chkconfig to control nsd service.

BUG FIXES:
	- Fixed nsdc start when nsd already running: do not initialize server, 
		since it is already running.
	- Fixup bug where data related files are looked up in the wrong
	  directory when chrooted with chrootdir ending with a slash.
	- Fixup bug where nsd would return FORMERR if received an edns
	  query with version set to zero and rdlen larger than zero.
	- Fixed strptime, so that zonec will also work on systems with broken 
		strptime (like leopard :-))
	- Do not answer nsec3 wildcard information when DO bit is not set
	- Better logging when creating database failed.
	- Various spelling errors

3.0.7
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Error handling for malformed IXFRs improved.
	- Fixed man pages, consistent syntax.

3.0.6
=============
FEATURES:
	- Report source and zone for denied AXFR attempts.

BUG FIXES:
	- More elegant handling of malformed nsec3 records from a zone 
	  transfer.
	- Fixup ignored return value in region-allocator.
        - Added bind2nsd 0.5.0 (http://bind2nsd.sourceforge.net) in contrib/.

3.0.5
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Fixed problem with reload waiting very long. If the OS has a 
	  raging herd problem, NSD could block in a UDP operation and
	  that process would stop reload from finishing. Made UDP sockets 
	  nonblocking. 
	- Made TCP listen sockets nonblocking. NSD could block in accept.
	- Handle the new CERT RDATA types defined in RFC 4398 (submitted by 
	  Mans Nilsson).
	- Fixed a bug where zonec would choke on unknown CERT RDATA types.
	- Change nsd-notify retry timer from linear into exponential
	  backoff (submitted by Mans Nilsson).
	- Debug flag (-d) behavior changed. Nsd now also forks children when 
	  run in debug mode.
	- Added verbosity mode (-V <level>) for extra operational logging.
	- zonesdir default is /etc/nsd.  This can be overridden in nsd.conf.
	- if clients drop the tcp connection this does not result in a logfile
	  entry, unless verbosity is set 2 or more.

3.0.4
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- zonec will print an error when other data is put next to a CNAME.
	- Fixup unaligned memory access that could occur when reading ixfr.db
	  with a partial transfer inside.
	- Fixup for the WKS RR type printout by nsd-patch and nsd-xfer.
	- Error message 'could not read database CRC' now only given on error.
	- ./configure --zonesdir=<directory for zone files> now works to
	  set a default value for the zonesdir: <dir> nsd.conf directive.
	  Set zonesdir: "" to disable the change of directory.
	- Bug: reload crashes with log message 'continuing with old database',
	  and after that no more zone updates. Manual fix is to kill -HUP,
	  but now fixed in software to try to reload again (and again).
	- Small speedup where xfrd could briefly be busy-waiting.
	- If master sends IXFR with glue that is already present in the zone
	  this is silently accepted. Printed in debug mode -L 2. To make
	  the log file smaller.
	- Exponential backoff for zones that never worked to max of 4 hours.
	  For expired zones the SOA retry values are used.
	- allow-notify acl entries 'NOKEY' match only queries without TSIG.
	- Answers to valid notifies contained wrong RR counts in the header.
	  The notifies were processed correctly, but now the acknowledgement
	  reply is in correct DNS format.
FEATURES:
	- Added contrib/nsd.zones2nsd.conf python script to convert NSD 2 to
	  NSD 3 config files, contributed by Stephane Bortzmeyer.
	- The nsdc control script will print 'nsd startup failed' if the nsd
	  executable does not start (due to bad permissions, bad config, ...).

3.0.3
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Bug #152: NSD would not use the identity from nsd.conf, fixed.
	- Bug #153: When running with thousands of secondary zones, NSD would
	  run out of UDP sockets. Caused crash on FreeBSD, errors on Linux
	  ('out of file descriptors'), depending on ulimits. Fixed.
	- Fixed getaddrinfo error message to be more descriptive.
	- Fallback to ip4 if getaddrinfo fails for ip6.
	- Will no longer lose a notify message during reloads (IPC).
	- Will no longer lose transfer in progress when notified for that zone.
	- Nicer error when operator forgets to rebuild after deleting a zone.

3.0.2
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Nice error from zonec on a wrong configuration zone name.
	- Nicer warning from zonec when starting secondary zone with
	  no zone file for the first time.
	- nsdc makes more portable use of 'which' (for SunOS5.9/bash2.05).
	- Bug #143: Improved handling of zonesdir: directive and relative 
	  pidfile, database, diff file, xfrdfile paths in nsdc.sh and 
	  nsd-patch. They would not find the files.
	- Bug #144: LOC RRtype default values for precision wrong. Fixed.
	- Bug #145: NSD failed to reload cases of simultaneous zone transfer.
	- Bug #146: NSD fails to write to xfrdfile when chrooted. Fixed.
		Also fix for difffile when chrooted.
	- Bug #147: NSD runs out of memory. Fixed, memory is reused.
	  Occurred when running NSD with very big zones and large updates.
	- nsd -L 1 logging is smaller, -L 2 contains all debug information.
	  (only available for debug compiles).
	- Bug #149: Fixed text for NOTAUTH error code. When notify is not
	  authorised REFUSED error code returned instead.

3.0.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- nsd-patch prints SOA record at start of zone files.

3.0.0
=============
FEATURES:
	- AXFR/IXFR zone transfer supported.
		- NSD requests but does not provide IXFR transfers.
		- NSD keeps track of SOA timeouts for secondary zones.
	- TSIG authentication supported.
		- For queries, for notifies, for zone transfers.
	- NOTIFY messages of zone updates, incoming and outgoing.
	- DNAME type is supported, including CNAME synthesis.
	- config file, nsd.conf(5), place to put TSIG keys, server settings,
	  and lists of ip-addresses/ranges for AXFR/IXFR and NOTIFY.
	- prepared for NSEC3 (--enable-nsec3), experimental code for testing
	  in workshops.
	- prepared for NSID (--enable-nsid), experimental code for testing in 
	  workshops.

OPERATIONAL NOTES:
	- config file needed, nsd.conf(5) supersedes nsd.zones and nsdc.conf.
	- AXFR transfers are denied by default. Allow in config file.
	- Zones only become secondary with "request-xfr:" items in config file.
	- NSD produces "ixfr.db" file with a journal of zone transfers.
	  Use nsdc patch to merge changes back to zone files and remake db.
	- NSD produces "xfrd.state" file with zone timeout information.
	  The file is text formatted.
	- NSD sends notifies automatically,
	  nsd-notify is deprecated and will be removed from the package. 
	- NSD requests AXFR/IXFR and reloads the updates automatically, 
	  nsd-xfer is deprecated and will be removed from the package.
	- Check your config file with nsd-checkconf.

BUG FIXES: 
	- contains all bug fixes from 2.3.5 and before.
	- The sighandler() bug is fixed more thoroughly,
	  by using pipes for interprocess communication.
	- CNAMEs are followed by the server to different zones and
	  information from that zone is returned. This saves a followup
	  query.
	- bug fixes (ported) 2.3.6.
		- nsd-notify will retry max 15 times 5 second retries.
		- Bug #105: nsdc lacks locking, fixed locking for root user.
		- Bug #134: nsd: make -N <large number> work again
		- Bug #135: Typo in locking code for nsdc, fixed.
		- uninitialised variable fixed.
		- unaligned memory access (on Solaris SPARC), in zonec 
		  LOC parsing, fixed.
		- Bug #138: nsd aborts trying to bind all interfaces if ip6 
		  is not enabled, instead it will fallback to ip4.
		- Bug #139: resync timer for stats to whole minute.
		- Bug #140: NSD did not clear CD bit on authoritative answers.
		- Bug #141: NSD did not clear flags on a formerror reply.

2.3.5
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #132: regression, nsd: fix compile with --disable-ipv6
        - Makefile: remove gnuisms

2.3.4
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Unknown type codes for type code numbers > 48 and < 97 work again.       
          (this implies --enable-checking can be enabled again)
        - nsd: sighandler() fixes
	- Bug #118: nsd: nsd_notify waits for a response. Will retry the notify
	  after a timeout.
        - Bug #124: $(DESTDIR) was added to Makefile.in. 
	- Bug #128: zonec: parser can handle \\ at the end of a string.
        - zonec: lexer: add \r to the newline delimeter
        - zonec: use strtol with an explicit base 10 as parameter.
          (Scott Rose, Roy Arends)
        - nsd-xfer: print human readable error codes. Change logging to 
          be more in line with the rest

2.3.3
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Apply the correct patch to nsdc.sh.in. 

2.3.2
=============
FEATURES:
        - Bug #101: add support for the SPF record.

BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #100: replaced non-portable use of timegm(3) with
          portable implementation (mktime_from_utc).
        - Bug #103: nsd: trim the SOA's TTL to the MINIMUM value when returning a 
          negative answer.
        - Bug #104: nsd: add a time_t timestamp to the log when logging to
          a file.
        - Bug #105: nsdc: use a lock file when rebuilding the database (patch by
          Jakob Schlyter/Ted Lindgreen/Sebastian/Ondrej Sury).
        - Bug #106: zonec: don't walk all 256 NSEC windows when that is not
          needed.
        - Bug #107: zonec: fixed a crash when encountering bad unknown rdata.
        - nsd: Don't print: "error: nsd is already running as <pid>, stopping"
          when in fact NSD continues to run.
        - nsd: Minimize the race window in sig_handler().

2.3.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - zonec: Don't crash when generating error messages outside of zone
          files.
        - nsd: when logging to a file the pid is now printed.
        - nsd: Reset 'boot' time in statistics when reloading the database,
          since the statistics are reset to 0 on a reload.
        - nsd-xfer.c: Added '-a' option to specify local address to connect
          from.  Original patch supplied by Walter Hop <nsd@walter.transip.nl>.
        - Bug #98: Allow mnemonics for DS and RRSIG algorithm field.

2.3.0
=============
FEATURES:
        - DNSSEC is now enabled by default. NSD should be fully
          compliant with RFC4033, RFC4034, and RFC4035.

BUG FIXES:
        - nsd: Ensure that the number of -a flags does not exceed the
          maximum specified by MAX_INTERFACES in config.h.
        - nsd-xfer: Use serial number arithmetic (RFC1982) for the
          zone serial check
        - nsdc: Don't pass (fake) serial number to nsd-xfer if the
          zone file does not exist.
        - zonec: Loading many zones would cause namedb_find_zone to
          slow down, performance patch by Kazunori Fujiwara.
        - Bug #96: nsd-xfer did not handle 8-bit domain names
          correctly.

2.2.1
=============
FEATURES:
        - The message priority is now included when logging to a file.

BUG FIXES:
        - Zero length RDATA using the unknown RR notation was not
          working (except for the APL RR type).
        - Bug #93: './configure' error message containing a comma must
          be properly bracketed.
        - Bug #94: nsd-xfer: Handle unexpected EOF when receiving AXFR
          data.  Timeout if no data is received for more than 120
          seconds (see the TCP_TIMEOUT parameter in config.h).
        - Bug #95: An owner starting with an asterisk label ("*") was
          being treated as its own wildcard child.

2.2.0
=============
FEATURES:
        - nsd-xfer: replacement program for named-xfer to perform zone
          transfers using AXFR. TSIG is supported by nsd-xfer but not
          yet by the nsd server. DNSSEC is also supported.  TSIG
          requires OpenSSL version 0.9.7 or higher, configure using
          --disable-tsig if you do not have OpenSSL installed.
          Configure using --with-ssl=path if OpenSSL is not installed
          at a standard location.

CODE CHANGES:
        - New data structure 'buffer_type' for representing binary
          buffers that can be read, written, and resized.  Data in
          these buffers is stored in network byte order.  This data
          structure replaces the iobuf field of 'struct query'.

BUG FIXES:
        - Fixed endian problem in WKS record.
        - Protocol can now be specified numerically in WKS record.
        - Allow escape sequences (\DDD) in TTL, RR class, and RR type.
        - The zone compiler now accepts many more characters in
          unquoted strings such as domain name labels.  The characters
          no longer need to be escaped with a backslash.
        - Close included files after reading.
        - Maximum TCP message size is now 65535 bytes.  AXFR response
          packets are still limited to 16383 bytes for optimal
          compression of dnames.
        - The TSIG key for AXFRs can now also be stored in the file
          <zonename>.tsiginfo.  This makes it possible to use TSIG
          with multiple master servers.
        - Signals are no longer blocked while performing I/O so the
          server should respond quicker to signals.
        - Fixed parsing of LOC rdata.  Fractions and altitude were not
          handled correctly.

2.1.5
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #90: handle \000 in TXT records correctly
        - Fixed undefined behavior in the use of vsnprintf when
          logging messages.  This caused crashes on Linux/PPC.

2.1.4
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - nsdc: Fixed a typo that caused AXFRs to stop working.

2.1.3
=============
FEATURES:
        - nsd: The pidfile can be specified using the '-P' option.

BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #87: allow @ in the rdata
        - Bug #88: allow ::FFFF:ipv4addr in AAAA records
        - Bug #89: Count the number of queries received over TCP,
          instead of the number of TCP connections.
        - Zonec: when - is used as input, set the filename to 'STDIN'.
        - The nsdc script handles failed AXFRs more gracefully.
        - NSD emits an error when it sees bitlabels (RFC 2673).
        - Only copy the CD bit when DNSSEC is enabled.

2.1.2
=============
FEATURES:
        - NSD now fully supports unknown record types using the
          notation specified in RFC3597.
        - Support for the following RR types has been added: WKS, X25,
          ISDN, RT, NSAP, PX, NAPTR, KX, CERT, DNAME, and APL.  DNAME
          special processing is not supported.

BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #84: NSD now uses SIGUSR1 instead of SIGILL to report stats.
        - Bug #85: Support for WKS records.
        - Bug #86: The characters "#%&^[]?" can now be used without
          backslash in zone file domain names.
        - Plugin callback return type fixed.
        - The maximum message length for IPv6 UDP packets is now
          limited to the IPv6 minimum MTU (1280) unless the
          IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU socket option is supported.

2.1.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #81: Handle unknown types correctly.
        - Bug #82: Zonec: don't report "0 errors" unless -v is
          specified.
        - Bug #83: Close zone files after parsing.
        - Handle AFSDB RR type.

2.1.0
=============
FEATURES:
        - New networking code allows a single server to handle both
          UDP and TCP connections.  By default up to 10 simultaneous
          TCP connections are supported.  Use the '-n' flag to change
          the default.

2.0.2
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Allow the use of a mnemonic for the algorithm field of a
          DNSKEY record.
        - Behavior of the zonec -v flag has been modified.  By default
          zonec will only print a single line with a summary of the
          error count.
        - Bug #75: Fixed typo in previous "fix".

2.0.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Queries for QTYPE DS (DNSSEC) were not handled correctly in
          certain cases.
        - Partial support for unknown RRs.  Known RR types with
          unknown RR data format is not yet supported.
        - Bug #75: Fixed bad error message when nsdc update is run for
          the first time.
        - Bug #78: Multiple zones, each with include directives, are
          now compiled correctly.

2.0.0
=============
FEATURES:
        - Experimental DNSSEC support implemented, but disabled by
          default.  Enable using the --enable-dnssec configuration
          option.
        - IPv6 enabled by default.  Disable using the --disable-ipv6
          configuration option.

BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #47: Domain name is now logged when a notify is
          received.
        - Bug #70: First include all A records in the additional
          section, followed by AAAA records.
        - Bug #77: Check length of domain name and label.
        - LOC records are supported again.

1.4.0-alpha1
=============
FEATURES:
        - New database format that is much more compact and portable
          across architectures.
        - The new zone compiler is now the default and the old zone
          compiler has been removed.
        - Name compression is done dynamically, removing one other
          difference with BIND in the responses generated (the full
          query name is now used for compression).
        - CNAME target records are now generated from wildcard
          records if necessary.

REGRESSIONS:
        - mmap(2) isn't currently supported.
        - Not all RR types are supported by zonec (such as LOC).

1.3.0-alpha1
=============
FEATURES:
        - New name lookup algorithm.  This required a change to the
          database format.  Performance should increase at the expense
          of database size and memory usage.
        - New zone compiler (zonec2) based on flex and yacc, fully RFC
          compliant (still in alpha).
        - Database can be loaded using mmap(2) (use the --enable-mmap
          configure option to enable).  This is useful on operating
          systems such as Solaris that do not allow memory overcommit.
        - Region based memory allocation and resource management.
        - New internal format for storing domain names.  Each dname
          now includes an array of label offsets within the domain
          name.
        - Updates to the plugin API.

BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #65: The syslog facility is now a compile time option
          (--with-facility=FACILITY).  The default facility is DAEMON.
        - Bug #66: Automatic periodic dumping of the statistics (using
          the -s option) is now continued after a database reload.

1.2.4
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #72: If an RRset for a child domain is defined before
          the RRset of the parent domain the parent's RRset would be
          "lost".

1.2.3
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #65: The syslog facility is now a compile time option
          (--with-facility=FACILITY).  The default facility is DAEMON.
        - Bug #66: Automatic periodic dumping of the statistics (using
          the -s option) is now continued after a database reload.
        - NSD would try to kill pid -1 on startup if forking of a child
          process failed.
        - Do not log EAGAIN errors on calls to recvfrom.  These errors
          should be harmless.

1.2.2
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #59: NSD returns FORMERR when the query name is >= 246
          bytes.
        - Bug #60: Zonec runs out of file descriptors with many zones.
        - Bug #61: nsdc uses /bin/sh hardwired (and should not).
        - Bug #62: NSD is not able to log to a file.
        - Bug #63: nsdc update and zonec are too talkative.
        - Bug #64: Answer for request of a host resolved by a
          wildcard-resource-record is not understandable by dig.

1.2.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - AXFR terminates early if a zone contains a CNAME pointing
          the the zone's domain name (SOA record) (bug #56).
        - During an AXFR memory above the top of the stack was
          accessed.  This could lead to occasional AXFR errors (bad
          packets).
        - NSD now prints its version number and exits when invoked
          with the -v flag (bug #57).
        - NSD prints help information and exits when invoked with the
          -h flag.

1.2.0
=============
FEATURES:
        - NSD is now a single parent process (handling child
          termination and database reloads) plus multiple UDP and TCP
          child processes handling queries.  Before the parent process
          also handled UDP queries.  This change simplifies the parent
          and child processes and allows the use of multiple
          concurrent UDP servers.
        - Experimental plugin support.  This required a minor,
          incompatible change to the database format.  Make sure you
          recompile your database.  Use --enable-plugins to enable.
        - Full IPv6 support (for multi-homing and for Linux, thanks to
          Colm MacCárthaigh and Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino).  Use
          --enable-ipv6 to enable.
        - Support for multi-homing with TCP connections.
        - Support for SunOS 4.x has been dropped.

CODE CHANGES:
        - NSD should now conform to the Single Unix Specification
          (http://www.unix.org/).
        - Const correctness for strings and some other data types.
        - Removed code for Berkeley DB, hash tables, and mmap(2).
        - Separate preprocessor flags from code flags (CPPFLAGS and
          CFLAGS).
        - Use uint8_t instead of u_char, uint{16,32}_t instead of
          u_int{16,32}_t.
        - Fixed warnings from mixing signed and unsigned types.
        - Use sigaction(2) instead of signal(2).
        - The query_process function has been split up for clarity.

BUG FIXES:
        - CHAOS TXT queries failed on big-endian machines.
        - Portability fixes for Tru64 (thanks to Stephane Bortzmeyer),
          HP-UX, and MacOS X (thanks to Ronald van der Pol).
        - Removed compile time limit on maximum number of TCP child
          servers.
        - Support for debugging UDP and TCP queries.
        - Always ensure there is enough room for the EDNS record when
          answering a query with EDNS enabled.

        - ANSI C
        - autoconf/configure
        - new parser
        - support for various RR types in zonec

        - lots of zone parsing errors eliminated
        - empty node matching bug gives NXDOMAIN

1.0.3
=============

        - Keep track of TCP child servers and restart if necessary.
          (bug #55)
        - Handle database reload failures correctly.
        - Close UDP sockets in TCP child servers.
        - Handle escaped characters (besides \.) in labels.

        - using named-xfer with TSIG for inbound axfr


CHANGES:
        - the order of records in the database is from now
          on significant
        - since Berkeley DB doesnt define order for sequential
          access it is no longer supported

BUG FIXES:
        - white space problem in zonec is fixed

KNOWN BUGS:
        - please see appropriate man pages for the known bugs

1.0.0 RELEASE
=============

KNOWN BUGS:

- Although NSD allows one to configure a zone without SOA record and
  use it as so called ``cached'' non-authoritative data, it is decided
  that having this functionality is wrong, dangerous and will be removed
  from the further versions.

- If while processing EDNS(0) OPT record NSD encounters bad EDNS(0)
  version it will answer with Format Error instead of EDNS(0) BADVERS
