	# The path to the bpffs to store/read the xsks_map pin. The default XDP

	# to have read/write/execute access to the specified bpffs to be able to
	# create and later delete the map pin. If you load the XDP program
	# yourself, NSD only needs read and write access to the pin file itself
	# (but at least execute access to the parent directories). The default
