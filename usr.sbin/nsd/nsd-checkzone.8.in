.SH "NAME"
.B nsd\-checkzone
\- NSD zone file syntax checker.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B nsd\-checkzone
.RB [ \-h ]
.I zonename
.I zonefile
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B nsd\-checkzone
reads a DNS zone file and checks it for errors.  It prints errors to
stderr.  On failure it exits with nonzero exit status.
.P
This is used to check files before feeding them to the nsd(8) daemon.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-h
Print usage help information and exit.
.TP
.I zonename
The name of the zone to check, eg. "example.com".
.TP
.I zonefile
The file to read, eg. "zones/example.com.zone.signed". Use "-" to read
from stdin.
.TP
.B \-p
Print the zone contents to stdout if the zone is ok. This prints the
contents as it has been parsed, not literally a copy of the input, but
as printed by the formatting routines in NSD, much like the nsd-control
command write does.
.TP
.B \-i \fI<oldzonefile>
Create an IXFR from the differences between the old zone file and the
new zone file. The argument to the \-i option is the old zone file,
the other zonefile argument passed is the new zonefile.
.sp
The difference is computed between the two zonefiles by keeping one
version of the zone in memory, and another version in a temporary
file. The temporary file is located at the zonefile directory. This is
also where the result is written, to a file with the zonefile name,
ending with '.ixfr'. This is also where NSD reads it when IXFRs are
configured for the zone.
.sp
The other existing ixfr files are renamed to become older IXFR contents
for the zone, if any such files exist.  If the output file already exists
with the correct contents, no new file is created. The contents of the
header of the output file are checked for that, if it already exists.
.TP
.B \-n \fI<ixfr number>
The number of IXFR versions to store, at most. Default 5. This is the number
of files that is created with ixfr contents for the zone. Older stored IXFR
versions are deleted when the number is exceeded.
.TP
.B \-s \fI<ixfr size>
The number of bytes of storage to use for IXFRs. Default is 1048576. If an
IXFR is bigger it is not created, and if the sum of IXFR storage exceeds it,
older IXFRs versions are deleted.
