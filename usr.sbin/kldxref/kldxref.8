.Sh NAME
.Nm kldxref
.Nd generate hints for the kernel loader
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Rdv
.Op Fl f Ar hintsfile
.Ar path ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to generate hint files which list modules, their
version numbers, and the files that contain them.
These hints are used by the kernel loader to determine where to find a
particular KLD module.
.Pp
A separate hint file is generated for each directory listed on the
command line that contains modules.
If no hint records are generated for a particular directory, no hint
file is created, and the preexisting hint file (if there was one in
that directory) is removed.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl R
Recurse into subdirectories.
.It Fl d
Do not generate a hint file, but print module metadata on standard
output.
.It Fl f Ar hintsfile
Specify a different name for the hints files than
.Pa linker.hints .
.It Fl v
Operate in verbose mode.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To build hint files for both standard and add-on modules:
.Pp
.Dl "kldxref /boot/kernel /boot/modules"
.Pp
To build hint files for all installed kernels:
.Pp
.Dl "kldxref -R /boot"
