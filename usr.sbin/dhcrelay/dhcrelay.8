.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcrelay
.Nd Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) relay agent
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dor
.Op Fl C Ar circuit-id
.Op Fl R Ar remote-id
.Fl i Ar interface
.Ar destination ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides a means for relaying DHCP and BOOTP requests from a subnet
to which no DHCP server is directly connected to one or more DHCP servers on
other subnets.
.Pp
.Nm
listens for DHCP requests on a given interface.
When a query is received,
.Nm
forwards it to the list of DHCP destinations specified on the command line.
When a reply is received, it is broadcast or unicast on the network from
whence the original request came.
.Pp
The server might be a name, address or interface.
.Nm
will operate in layer 2 mode when the specified servers are interfaces,
otherwise it will operate in layer 3 mode.
.Pp
The name of at least one DHCP server to which DHCP and BOOTP requests
should be relayed,
as well as the name of the network interface that
.Nm
should attempt to configure,
must be specified on the command line.
.Pp
.Nm
supports relaying of DHCP traffic to configure IPsec tunnel mode
clients when listening on the
.Xr enc 4
interface using layer 3 mode only.
The DHCP server has to support RFC 3046 to echo back the relay agent
information to allow stateless DHCP reply to IPsec tunnel mapping.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C Ar circuit-id
The
.Ar circuit-id
relay agent information sub-option value that
.Nm
should append on relayed packets.
If this option is not specified, it will use the interface number by default.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl i Ar interface
The name of the network interface that
.Nm
should attempt to configure.
For layer 3 mode at least one IPv4 address has to be configured on this
interface.
.It Fl o
Add the relay agent information option.
By default, this is only enabled for the
.Xr enc 4
interface.
.It Fl R Ar remote-id
The
.Ar remote-id
relay agent information sub-option value that
.Nm
should append on relayed packets.
If this option is not specified, it will use the destination address by default.
.It Fl r
Replace incoming Relay Agent Information with the one configured.

The current implementation was reworked by
.An Henning Brauer Aq Mt henning@openbsd.org .
.Sh BUGS
Relayed DHCP traffic could actually safely be protected by IPsec but,
like
.Xr dhcpd 8
and
.Xr dhcpleased 8 ,
.Nm
will bypass IPsec for all its traffic.
