.Sh NAME
.Nm apmd
.Nd Advanced Power Management daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm apmd
.Op Fl AadHLs
.Op Fl f Ar devname
.Op Fl S Ar sockname
.Op Fl t Ar seconds
.Op Fl w Ar percent
.Op Fl Z Ar percent
.Op Fl z Ar percent
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
monitors the advanced power management device,
.Xr apm 4 ,
acting on signaled events and upon user requests as sent by the
.Xr apm 8
program.
.Pp
On
.Ox ,
power management is handled by the kernel,
and the default policy can be set using the
.Va hw.perfpolicy
.Xr sysctl 2 .
If
.Nm
is not running,
.Xr apm 8
is still able to query the
.Xr apm 4
driver for a limited amount of information,
but
.Nm
provides more advanced functionality,
such as the ability to switch performance modes.
.Pp
For suspend and standby request events delivered by the BIOS, or via
.Xr apm 8 ,
.Nm
runs the appropriate configuration program (if one exists),
syncs the buffer cache to disk and initiates the requested state.
When resuming after suspend or standby,
.Nm
runs the appropriate configuration program (if one exists).
.Pp
When the power status changes
(external power is connected or disconnected),
.Nm
fetches the current status and reports it via
.Xr syslog 3
with logging facility
.Dv LOG_DAEMON .
.Pp
.Nm
can change the system performance policy at startup when called
with the
.Fl A ,
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
options, and during runtime when requested by
.Xr apm 8 .
.\" XXX keep in sync with hw.perfpolicy in sysctl(2)
The default performance policy is "high" when connected to line current,
and "auto" when running on battery.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A
Start
.Nm
in automatic performance adjustment mode.
.It Fl a
BIOS-initiated suspend or standby requests are
ignored if the system is connected to line current and not running from
batteries (user requests are still honored).
.It Fl d
.Nm
enters debug mode, staying in the foreground.
Logging output is printed to stderr.
.It Fl f Ar devname
Specify an alternate device file name,
.Ar devname .
.It Fl H
Start
.Nm
in manual performance adjustment mode, initialising
.Va hw.setperf
to 100.
.It Fl L
Start
.Nm
in manual performance adjustment mode, initialising
.Va hw.setperf
to 0.
.It Fl S Ar sockname
Specify an alternate socket name,
.Ar sockname .
The socket is protected to mode 0660, UID 0, GID 0; this protects access
to suspend requests to authorized users only.
.It Fl s
Current battery statistics are reported via
.Xr syslog 3
and
.Nm
exits without monitoring the APM status.
.It Fl t Ar seconds
.Nm
periodically polls the APM driver for the current power state.
If the battery charge level changes substantially or the external power
status changes, the new status is logged.
The polling rate defaults to
once per 10 minutes, but may be specified using the
.Fl t
command-line flag.
.It Fl w Ar percent
Log warning and enable
.Dq warnlow
actions if no AC is connected and the
estimated battery life is equal or below
.Ar percent .
.It Fl Z Ar percent
Automatically hibernate the system if no AC is connected and the
estimated battery life is equal or below
.Ar percent .
.It Fl z Ar percent
Automatically suspend the system if no AC is connected and the
estimated battery life is equal or below
.Ar percent .
.Pp
If both
.Fl Z
and
.Fl z
are specified, the last one will supersede the other.
After a resume, the effect of those options is inhibited for 60 seconds.
.El
.Pp
When a client requests a suspend or stand-by state,
.Nm
does not wait for positive confirmation that the requested
state has been entered before replying to the client; to do so would mean
the client does not get a reply until the system resumes from its sleep state.
Rather,
.Nm
replies with the intended state to the client and then places the system
in the requested state after running the configuration script and
flushing the buffer cache.
.Pp
Actions can be configured for the following transitions:
hibernate,
powerdown,
powerup,
resume,
standby,
suspend,
and
warnlow.
The warnlow action is run if
.Fl w
is used.
The suspend, hibernate and standby actions are run prior to
.Nm
performing any other actions (such as disk syncs) and entering the new
state.
The resume program is run after resuming from a stand-by or
suspended state.
The powerup and powerdown programs are run after the power status (AC
connected or not) changes, as well as after a resume (if the power
status changed in the mean time).
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/apm/powerdownXX" -compact
.It Pa /dev/apmctl
Default device used to control
.Xr apm 4 .
.Pp
.It Pa /etc/apm/hibernate
.It Pa /etc/apm/powerdown
.It Pa /etc/apm/powerup
.It Pa /etc/apm/resume
.It Pa /etc/apm/standby
.It Pa /etc/apm/suspend
.It Pa /etc/apm/warnlow
Action hook files which, if present, must be executable.
Each file must be an executable binary or shell script.
A single program or script can be used to control all transitions
by examining the name by which it was called.
.Pp
.It Pa /etc/random.seed
Random seed file read by the bootloader;
updated on
.Dq hibernate ,
.Dq standby
and
.Dq suspend .
.Pp
.It Pa /var/run/apmdev
Default
.Ux Ns -domain
socket used for communication with
.Xr apm 8 .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 1.2 .
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
does not support specifying an alternate performance policy to be used
when the system is running on battery.
See the
.Va hw.perfpolicy
setting documented in
.Xr sysctl 2 .
