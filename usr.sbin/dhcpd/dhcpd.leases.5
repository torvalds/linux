.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcpd.leases
.Nd DHCP server lease database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Internet Software Consortium DHCP Server keeps a persistent
database of leases that it has assigned.
This database is a free-form ASCII file containing a series of
lease declarations.
Every time a lease is acquired, renewed or released, its new value is
recorded at the end of the lease file.
So if more than one declaration appears for a given lease,
the last one in the file is the current one.
.Sh FORMAT
Currently, the only declaration that is used in the
.Nm
file is the
.Ic lease
declaration.
.Pp
.D1 Ic lease Ar ip-address No { Ar statements... No }
.Pp
Each lease declaration includes the single IP address that has been
leased to the client.
The statements within the braces define the duration of the lease
and to whom it is assigned.
.Pp
The start and end time of a lease are recorded using the
.Ic starts
and
.Ic ends
statements:
.Pp
.D1 Ic starts Ar date ;
.D1 Ic ends Ar date ;
.Pp
Dates are specified as follows:
.Pp
.D1 Ar weekday year Ns / Ns Ar month Ns / Ns Ar day hour : Ns Ar minute : Ns Ar second
.Pp
The weekday is present to make it easy for a human to tell when a
lease expires \- it's specified as a number from zero to six, with zero
being Sunday.
The day of week is ignored on input.
The year is specified with the century, so it should generally be four digits
except for really long leases.
The month is specified as a number starting with 1 for January.
The day of the month is likewise specified starting with 1.
The hour is a number from 0 to 23, the minute a number from 0 to 59,
and the second also a number from 0 to 59.
.Pp
Lease times are specified in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), not in the
local time zone.
.Pp
The MAC address of the network interface that was used to acquire the
lease is recorded with the
.Ic hardware
statement:
.Pp
.D1 Ic hardware Ar hardware-type mac-address ;
.Pp
The MAC address is specified as a series of hexadecimal octets,
separated by colons.
.Pp
If the client uses a client identifier to acquire its address, the
client identifier is recorded using the
.Ic uid
statement:
.Pp
.D1 Ic uid Ar client-identifier ;
.Pp
The client identifier is recorded as a series of hexadecimal octets,
regardless of whether the client specifies an ASCII string or uses the
newer hardware type/MAC address format.
.Pp
If the client sends a hostname using the
.Ic Client Hostname
option, as specified in some versions of the DHCP-DNS Interaction draft, that
hostname is recorded using the
.Ic client-hostname
statement.
.Pp
.D1 Ic client-hostname Qq Ar hostname ;
.Pp
If the client sends its hostname using the
.Ic Hostname
option, it is recorded using the
.Ic hostname
statement.
.Pp
.D1 Ic hostname Qq Ar hostname ;
.Pp
The DHCP server may determine that a lease has been misused in some
way, either because a client that has been assigned a lease NAKs it,
or because the server's own attempt to see if an address is in use
prior to reusing it reveals that the address is in fact already in
use.
In that case, the
.Ic abandoned
statement will be used to indicate that the lease should not be reassigned.
.Pp
.D1 Ic abandoned ;
.Pp
Abandoned leases are reclaimed automatically.
When a client asks for a new address, and the server finds that there
are no new addresses, it checks to see if there are any abandoned leases,
and allocates the least recently abandoned lease.
The standard mechanisms for checking for lease address conflicts are still
followed, so if the abandoned lease's IP address is still in use,
it will be reabandoned.
.Pp
If a client
.Em requests
an abandoned address, the server assumes that the reason the address was
abandoned was that the lease file was corrupted, and that the client is
the machine that responded when the lease was probed,
causing it to be abandoned.
In that case, the address is immediately assigned to the client.
