.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcp-options
.Nd DHCP options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Dynamic Host Configuration protocol allows the client to receive
.Ic options
from the DHCP server describing the network configuration and various
services that are available on the network.
When configuring
.Xr dhcpd 8 ,
options must often be declared.
The syntax for declaring options, and the names and formats of the options
that can be declared, are documented here.
.Pp
DHCP
.Ic option
statements always start with the
.Ic option
keyword, followed by an option name, followed by option data.
The option names and data formats are described below.
It is not necessary to exhaustively specify all DHCP options \-
only those options which are needed by clients must be specified.
.Pp
Option data comes in a variety of formats, as defined below:
.Pp
The
.Ar ip-address
data type can be entered either as an explicit IP address
(e.g., 239.254.197.10) or as a domain name (e.g., haagen.isc.org).
A domain name must resolve to a single IP address.
.Pp
The
.Ar cidr
data type specifies a network in CIDR notion.
e.g. 1.2.3/24.
.Pp
The
.Ar int32
data type specifies a signed 32-bit integer.
The
.Ar uint32
data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit integer.
The
.Ar uint16
data type specifies unsigned 16-bit integers.
The
.Ar uint8
data type specifies unsigned 8-bit integers,
sometimes referred to as octets.
.Pp
The
.Ar string
data type specifies an
.Tn NVT
.Pq Network Virtual Terminal
.Tn ASCII
string, which must be enclosed in double quotes \- for example,
to specify a domain-name option, the syntax would be
.Pp
.Dl option domain-name \&"isc.org\&";
.Pp
The
.Ar flag
data type specifies a boolean value.
Booleans can be either true or false
(or on or off, if that makes more sense to you).
.Pp
The
.Ar data-string
data type specifies either an
.Tn NVT ASCII
string enclosed in double quotes, or a series of octets specified in
hexadecimal, separated by colons.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl option dhcp-client-identifier \&"CLIENT-FOO\&";
or
.Dl option dhcp-client-identifier 43:4c:49:45:4e:54:2d:46:4f:4f;
.Pp
The documentation for the various options mentioned below is taken
from the IETF draft document on DHCP options, RFC 2132.
Options which are not listed by name may be defined by the name
.Pf option- Ar nnn ,
where
.Ar nnn
is the decimal number of the option code.
These options may be followed either by a string, enclosed in quotes, or by
a series of octets, expressed as two-digit hexadecimal numbers separated
by colons.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
option option-133 "my-option-133-text";
option option-129 1:54:c9:2b:47;
.Ed
.Pp
Because
.Xr dhcpd 8
does not know the format of these undefined option codes,
no checking is done to ensure the correctness of the entered data.
.Pp
The defined options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic option all-subnets-local Ar flag ;
This option specifies whether or not the client may assume that all subnets
of the IP network to which the client is connected use the same MTU as the
subnet of that network to which the client is directly connected.
A value of 1 indicates that all subnets share the same MTU.
A value of 0 means that the client should assume that some subnets of the
directly connected network may have smaller MTUs.
.It Ic option arp-cache-timeout Ar uint32 ;
This option specifies the timeout in seconds for ARP cache entries.
.It Ic option autoproxy-script Ar string ;
Site-specific as of RFC 3942.
Widely used for Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol (WPAD).
.It Ic option boot-size Ar uint16 ;
This option specifies the length in 512-octet blocks of the default
boot image for the client.
.It Ic option bootfile-name Ar string ;
This option is used to identify a bootstrap file.
If supported by the client, it should have the same effect as the
.Ic filename
declaration.
BOOTP clients are unlikely to support this option.
Some DHCP clients will support it, and others actually require it.
.It Ic option broadcast-address Ar ip-address ;
This option specifies the broadcast address in use on the client's subnet.
Legal values for broadcast addresses are specified in section 3.2.1.3 of
RFC 1122.
.It Ic option classless-static-routes Ar cidr ip-address Oo , Ar cidr ip-address ... Oc ;
This option specifies a list of destination networks and the
associated gateways.
This option is defined in RFC 3442.
The RFC says that clients supporting this option must ignore the
.Ic Routers
option when both are present.
Thus default routes, if any,
must be included in the list.
The
.Ar cidr
of a default route is 0/0.
.It Ic option classless-ms-static-routes Ar cidr ip-address Oo , Ar cidr ip-address ... Oc ;
This option does the same as
.Ic classless-static-routes ,
but uses option code 249 instead of 121,
since Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 ignore option 121.
.It Ic option cookie-servers Ar ip-address Oo , Ar ip-address ... Oc ;
The
.Ic cookie-servers
option specifies a list of RFC 865 cookie servers available to the client.
Servers should be listed in order of preference.
.It Ic option default-ip-ttl Ar uint8 ;
This option specifies the default time-to-live that the client should
use on outgoing datagrams.
.It Ic option default-tcp-ttl Ar uint8 ;
This option specifies the default TTL that the client should use when
sending TCP segments.
The minimum value is 1.
.It Ic option dhcp-class-identifier Ar string ;
This option is used by DHCP clients to optionally identify the vendor type
and configuration of a DHCP client.
The information is a string of n octets, interpreted by servers.
Vendors may choose to define specific vendor class identifiers to convey
particular configuration or other identification information about a client.
For example, the identifier may encode the client's hardware configuration.
Servers not equipped to interpret the class-specific information sent by a
client must ignore it (although it may be reported).
Servers that respond should only use option 43
.Pq Ic vendor-encapsulated-options
to return the vendor-specific information to the client.
.It Ic option dhcp-client-identifier Ar data-string ;
This option can be used to specify a DHCP client identifier in a
host declaration, so that
.Xr dhcpd 8
can find the host record by matching against the client identifier.
.It Ic option dhcp-lease-time Ar uint32 ;
This option is used in a client request (DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST) to
allow the client to request a lease time for the IP address.
In a server reply (DHCPOFFER), a DHCP server uses this option to specify the
lease time it is willing to offer.
.It Ic option dhcp-max-message-size Ar uint16 ;
This option specifies the maximum length
.Ic option dhcp-message
that the DHCP client is willing to accept.
The length is specified as an unsigned 16-bit integer.
A client may use the maximum DHCP message size option in DHCPDISCOVER or
DHCPREQUEST messages, but should not use the option in DHCPDECLINE messages.
.It Ic option dhcp-message Ar string ;
This option is used to send an error message to a DHCP client in
the event of a failure.
The maximum acceptable length of the message can be set with
.Ic option dhcp-max-message-size .
.It Ic option dhcp-message-type Ar uint8 ;
This option is used to convey the type of the DHCP message.
Values: 1=DHCPDISCOVER, 2=DHCPOFFER, 3=DHCPREQUEST, 4=DHCPDECLINE, 5=DHCPACK,
6=DHCPNAK, 7=DHCPRELEASE, 8=DHCPINFORM.
.It Ic option dhcp-option-overload Ar uint8 ;
This option is used to indicate that the DHCP 'sname' or 'file' fields are
being overloaded by using them to carry DHCP options.
A DHCP server inserts this option if the returned parameters will exceed
the usual space allotted for options.
If this option is present, the client interprets the specified additional
fields after it concludes interpretation of the standard option fields.
A value of 1 means the 'file' field is used to hold options.
A value of 2 means the 'sname' field is used to hold options.
A value of 3 means both fields are used to hold options.
.It Ic option dhcp-parameter-request-list Ar uint8 Oo , Ar uint8 ... Oc ;
This option is used by a DHCP client to request values for specified
configuration parameters.
The list of requested parameters is specified as n octets, where each
octet is a valid DHCP option code as defined in this document.
The client MAY list the options in order of preference.
The DHCP server is not required to return the options in the requested
order, but MUST try to insert the requested options in the order requested
by the client.
.It Ic option dhcp-rebinding-time Ar uint32 ;
This option specifies the time interval from address assignment until the
client transitions to the REBINDING state.
The value is in seconds.
.It Ic option dhcp-renewal-time Ar uint32 ;
This option specifies the time interval from address assignment until the
client transitions to the RENEWING state.
The value is in seconds.
.It Ic option dhcp-requested-address Ar ip-address ;
This option is used in a client request (DHCPDISCOVER) to allow the client
to request that a particular IP address be assigned.
.It Ic option dhcp-server-identifier Ar ip-address ;
This option is used in DHCPOFFER and DHCPREQUEST messages, and may
optionally be included in the DHCPACK and DHCPNAK messages.
DHCP servers include this option in the DHCPOFFER in order to allow the
client to distinguish between lease offers.
DHCP clients use the contents of the 'server identifier' field as the
destination address for any DHCP messages unicast to the DHCP server.
DHCP clients also indicate which of several lease offers is being accepted
by including this option in a DHCPREQUEST message.
The identifier is the IP address of the selected server.
.It Ic option domain-name Ar string ;
This option specifies the domain name that the client should use when
resolving hostnames via the Domain Name System.
.It Ic option domain-name-servers Ar ip-address Oo , Ar ip-address ... Oc ;

(it is preferable to use the
.Ic domain-name
option to specify the domain name).
See RFC 1035 for character set restrictions.
.It Ic option ieee802-3-encapsulation Ar flag ;
This option specifies whether or not the client should use Ethernet
Version 2 (RFC 894) or IEEE 802.3 (RFC 1042) encapsulation if the
interface is an Ethernet.
A value of 0 indicates that the client should use RFC 894 encapsulation.
A value of 1 means that the client should use RFC 1042 encapsulation.
.It Ic option ien116-name-servers Ar ip-address Oo , Ar ip-address ... Oc ;

the
.Tn NVT ASCII
character set.
.It Ic option mobile-ip-home-agent Ar ip-address Oo , Ar ip-address ... Oc ;
This option specifies a list of IP addresses indicating Mobile IP
home agents available to the client.
Agents should be listed in order of preference, although normally there
will be only one such agent.
.It Ic option nds-context Ar data-string ;
This option specifies the initial NDS context the client should use.
NDS contexts are 16-bit Unicode strings.
For transmission in the NDS Context Option, an NDS context is
transformed into octets using UTF-8.
The string should NOT be zero terminated.
A single DHCP option can only contain 255 octets.
Since an NDS context name can be longer than that, this option can
appear more than once in the DHCP packet.
The contents of all NDS Context options in the packet should be
concatenated as suggested in the DHCP specification to get the
complete NDS context.
A single encoded character could be split between two NDS Context Options.
See RFC 2241 for details.
.It Ic option nds-servers Ar ip-address Oo , Ar ip-address ... Oc ;

messages on connections unless specifically requested by an application.
.It Ic option tftp-config-file Ar string ;
Option 144.
Per RFC 2132 options 128 \- 254 are site-specific.
RFC 3942 reclassifies options 128 to 223 as publicly defined options and
puts them in "Unavailable" state by IANA.
See RFC 3679 for "Unused DHCP Option Codes to be Reassigned to Future
DHCP Options".
See RFC 2939 for procedures for definitions of new DHCP options.
.It Ic option tftp-server-name Ar string ;
This option is used to identify a TFTP server and, if supported by the
client, should have the same effect as the

A value of 0 indicates that the client should not attempt to use trailers.
A value of 1 means that the client should attempt to use trailers.
.It Ic option user-class Ar string ;
This option is used by a DHCP client to optionally identify the type or
category of user or applications it represents.
A DHCP server uses the User Class option to choose the address pool it
allocates an address from and/or to select any other configuration option.
This option may carry multiple User Classes.
Servers may interpret the meanings of multiple class specifications in an
implementation dependent or configuration dependent manner, and so the use
of multiple classes by a DHCP client should be based on the specific server
implementation and configuration which will be used to process that User
class option.
See RFC 3004 for details.
.It Ic option vendor-encapsulated-options Ar data-string ;
This option is used by clients and servers to exchange vendor-specific
information.
The information is an opaque object of n octets, presumably interpreted by
