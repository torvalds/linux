.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon handles remote Bluetooth HID devices.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a Ar BD_ADDR
Specify the local address to listen on.
By default, the server will listen on
.Dv ANY
address.
The address can be specified as BD_ADDR or name.
If a name was specified, the
.Nm
daemon will attempt to resolve the name via
.Xr bt_gethostbyname 3 .
.It Fl c Ar file
Specify path to the configuration file.
The default path is
.Pa /etc/bluetooth/bthidd.conf .
.It Fl d
Do not detach from the controlling terminal, i.e., run in foreground.
.It Fl H Ar file
Specify path to the known HIDs file.
The default path is
.Pa /var/db/bthidd.hids .
.It Fl h
Display usage message and exit.
.It Fl p Ar file
Specify path to the PID file.
The default path is
.Pa /var/run/bthidd.pid .
.It Fl t Ar val
Specify client rescan interval in seconds.
The
.Nm
daemon will periodically scan for newly configured Bluetooth HID devices or
disconnected
.Dq passive
Bluetooth HID devices and will attempt to establish an outgoing connection.
The default rescan interval is 10 seconds.
.It Fl u
Enable support for input event device protocol.
Requires evdev and uinput drivers to be loaded with
.Xr kldload 8
or compiled into the kernel.
.El
.Sh KNOWN LIMITATIONS
The
.Nm
daemon currently does not handle key auto repeat and double click mouse events.
Those events work under
.Xr X 7
just fine,
but not in text console.
.Pp
This manual page needs more work.
A manual page documenting the format of the
.Pa /etc/bluetooth/bthidd.conf
configuration file is needed as well.

.Sh CAVEATS
Any Bluetooth HID device that has
.Dv HUP_KEYBOARD
or
.Dv HUP_CONSUMER
entries in its descriptor is considered as
.Dq keyboard .
For each
.Dq keyboard
Bluetooth HID device,
the
.Nm
daemon will use a separate instance of the virtual keyboard interface
.Xr vkbd 4 .
Therefore the
.Xr kbdmux 4
driver must be used to properly multiplex input from multiple keyboards.
