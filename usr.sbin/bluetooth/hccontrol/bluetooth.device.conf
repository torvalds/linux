# The authentication_enable parameter controls if the device requires to
# authenticate the remote device at connection setup. At connection setup,
# only the devices with the authentication_enable parameter enabled will
# try to authenticate the other device.
#
# Possible values:
#
# NO  or 0	authentication disabled (default);
# YES or 1	authentication enabled.

# authentication_enable="NO"

# The class parameter is used to indicate the capabilities of the device to
# other devices.
#
# For more details see "Assigned Numbers - Bluetooth Baseband" document
#
# Possible value:
#
# xx:xx:xx	where xx is a hex number

# class="ff:01:0c"

# The connectable parameter controls whether or not the device should
# periodically scan for page attempts from other devices.
#
# Possible values:
#
# NO  or 0	do not scan for page attempts;
# YES or 1	scan for page attempts (default).

# connectable="YES"

# The discoverable parameter controls whether or not the device should
# periodically scan for inquiry requests from other devices.
#
# Possible values:
#
# NO  or 0	do not scan for inquiry requests;
# YES or 1	scan for inquiry requests (default).

# discoverable="NO"

# The encryption_mode parameter controls if the device requires encryption
# to the remote device at connection setup. At connection setup, only the
# devices with the authentication_enable parameter enabled and encryption_mode
# parameter enabled will try to encrypt the connection to the other device.
#
# Possible values:
#
# NONE or 0	encryption disabled (default);
# P2P  or 1	encryption only for point-to-point packets;
# ALL  or 2	encryption for both point-to-point and broadcast packets.

# encryption_mode="NONE"

# HCI node debug level. Higher values mean more verbose output.
#
# Possible values: 0 - 4

# hci_debug_level="3"

# L2CAP node debug level. Higher values mean more verbose output.
#
# Possible values: 0 - 4

# l2cap_debug_level="3"

# The local_name parameter provides the ability to modify the user friendly
# name for the device.

# local_name="My device"

# The role_switch parameter controls whether the local device should perform
# role switch. By default, if role switch is supported, the local device will
# try to perform role switch and become Master on incoming connection. Some
# devices do not support role switch and thus incoming connections from such
# devices will fail. If role switch is disabled then accepting device will
# remain Slave.
#
# NO  or 0	do not perform role switch;
# YES or 1	perform role switch (default).

# role_switch="YES"
