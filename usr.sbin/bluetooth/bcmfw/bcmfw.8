.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility downloads the specified mini-driver and firmware files to the specified
device.
.Pp
This utility will
.Em only
work with Broadcom BCM2033 chip based Bluetooth USB devices.
The identification is currently based on USB vendor ID/product ID pair.
The vendor ID should be 0x0a5c
.Pq Dv USB_VENDOR_BROADCOM
and the product ID should be 0x2033.
.Pp
Due to copyright issues I will no longer provide mini-driver and firmware
files for the device.
These files can be obtained from the Linux BlueZ bluez-firmware package.
.Pp
Visit
.Pa http://www.bluez.org/download.html
for details.
.Pp
I am using the following files from the bluez-firmware-1.0 package:
.Pp
.Dl "MD5 (BCM2033-MD.hex) = 5580317158d07fc4ace90af04f8e1c73"
.Dl "MD5 (BCM2033-FW.bin) = b4e142b3272cfe5a84b32fda6b4b032f"
