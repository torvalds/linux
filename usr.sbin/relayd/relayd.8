.Sh NAME
.Nm relayd
.Nd relay daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dnv
.Op Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon to relay and dynamically redirect incoming connections to
a target host.
Its main purposes are to run as a load-balancer, application layer
gateway, or transparent proxy.
The daemon is able to monitor groups of hosts for availability, which
is determined by checking for a specific service common to a host
group.
When availability is confirmed,
layer 3 and/or layer 7 forwarding services are set up by
.Nm .
.Pp
Layer 3 redirection happens at the packet level; to configure
it,
.Nm
communicates with
.Xr pf 4 .
To allow
.Nm
to properly set up
.Xr pf 4
rules, the following line is required in the filter section of
.Xr pf.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
anchor "relayd/*"
.Ed
.Pp
Layer 7 relaying happens at the application level and is
handled by
.Nm
itself.
Various application level filtering and protocol-specific
load-balancing options are available for relays.
.Pp
.Nm
works in terms of the following
.Em entities :
relays, protocols, redirections, and tables.
A
.Em relay
represents a layer 7 load-balancing instance.
Each instance translates to a listening TCP or UDP port.
A
.Em protocol
defines which actions, if any, are taken on the
packet payload as data crosses a relay.
A
.Em redirection
represents a layer 3 load-balancing instance.
Each instance translates to a
.Xr pf 4
rdr-to rule being added.
A
.Em table
represents a group of hosts which can be checked for
availability using the same method.
Each table contains at least one host.
If a table is used in a layer 3 load-balancing instance, it
will be mapped to a
.Xr pf 4
table containing only those hosts which are up.
.Pp
All these entities can be configured in
.Xr relayd.conf 5 ,
and
.Xr relayctl 8
can be used to alter or report on the status of each entity.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /etc/relayd.conf .
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/run/relayd.sockXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/relayd.conf

.It Pa /var/run/relayd.sock
