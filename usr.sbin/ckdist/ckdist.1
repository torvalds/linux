.Nm ckdist
.Nd check software distributions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Bq Fl airsx
.Bq Fl d Ar dir
.Bq Fl n Ar name
.Bq Fl t Ar type
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads
.Dq checksum
files (which are assumed to specify components
of a software distribution) and verifies the integrity of the
distribution by validating the checksum of each component file.
Both MD5 (128-bit
.Dq "message digest" )
and
.Pa .inf
(32-bit CRC) checksum
formats are supported.
.Pp
The
.Ar file
operands may refer to regular files or to directories.
Regular files
named
.Pa md5 ,
or which have an
.Pa .md5
or an
.Pa .inf
extension, are
assumed to be of the implied type, otherwise format is determined from
content.
If a directory is specified, it is searched for
appropriately-named files only.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.\"Bl -tag -width ".Fl n Ar name"
.Bl -tag -width 8n -offset indent
.It Fl a
Report on all distribution components, not just those in respect of
which errors are detected.
.It Fl i
Ignore missing distribution components.
.It Fl r
Search specified directories recursively.
.It Fl s
Suppress complaints about inaccessible checksum files and directories.
.It Fl x
Verify the existence of distribution components (and also check sizes,
in the case of
.Pa .inf
files), but omit the more time-consuming step of
actually computing and comparing checksums.
.It Fl d Ar dir
Look for distribution components in the directory
.Ar dir .
.It Fl n Ar name
Access distribution components using the filename
.Ar name .
When accessing
.Pa .inf
file components, append the appropriate
extension to the filename.
.It Fl t Ar type
Assume that all specified checksum files are of the format
.Ar type ,
and search directories only for files in this format (where
.Ar type
is either
.Cm md5
or
.Cm inf ) .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It 0
No errors were detected.
.It 1
Errors were found in a distribution.
.It 2
Usage errors, inaccessible input files, or
other system errors were encountered.

.Sh NOTES
Both
.Bx
and
.Tn DOS
versions of
.Nm
are available.
