.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ndis_events
.Nd relay events from
.Xr ndis 4
drivers to
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility listens for events generated by an
.Xr ndis 4
wireless network driver and relays them to
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
for possible processing.
The three event types that can occur
are media connect and disconnect events, such as when a wireless
interface joins or leaves a network, and media-specific events.
In particular,
.Xr ndis 4
drivers that support WPA2 will generate media-specific events
containing PMKID candidate information which
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
needs in order to properly associate with WPA2-capable access points.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon works by listening for interface information events via
a routing socket.
When it detects an event that was generated by an
.Xr ndis 4
interface, it transmits it via UDP packet on the loopback interface,
where
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
is presumably listening.
The standard
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
distribution includes its own version of this utility for use with
.Tn Windows\[rg] .
The
.Fx
version performs the same functions as the
.Tn Windows\[rg]
one, except that it uses an
.Xr ioctl 2
and routing socket interface instead of WMI.
.Pp
Note that a single instance of
.Nm
is sufficient to scan for events for any number of
.Xr ndis 4
interfaces in a system.
.Sh OPTIONS
The
.Nm
daemon supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Process all events.
By default,
.Nm
will only process and forward media-specific events, which contain
PMKID candidate information, and not bother forwarding connect and
disconnect events, since
.Xr wpa_supplicant 8
normally can determine the current link state on its own.
In some
cases, the additional connect and disconnect events only confuse it
and make the association and authentication process take longer.
.It Fl d
Run in debug mode.
This causes
.Nm
to run in the foreground and generate any output to the standard
error instead of using the
.Xr syslog 3
facility.
.It Fl v
Run in verbose mode.
This causes
.Nm
to emit notifications when it receives events.
