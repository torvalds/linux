.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
is an implementation of the WPA Supplicant component,
i.e., the part that runs in the client stations.
It implements WPA key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator
and EAP authentication with an Authentication Server.
In addition,
.Nm
controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11
authentication/association support of the
.Xr wlan 4
module and can be used to configure static WEP keys
based on identified networks.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility
is designed to be a
.Dq daemon
program that runs in the
background and acts as the backend component controlling
the wireless connection.
It supports separate frontend programs such as the
text-based
.Xr wpa_cli 8
program.
.Pp
The following arguments must be specified on the command line:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl i Ar ifname
Use the specified wireless interface.
.It Fl c Ar config-file
Use the settings in the specified configuration file when managing
the wireless interface.
See
.Xr wpa_supplicant.conf 5
for a description of the configuration file syntax and contents.
.Pp
Changes to the configuration file can be reloaded by sending a
.Dv SIGHUP
to the
.Nm
process or with the
.Xr wpa_cli 8
utility, using
.Dq Li "wpa_cli reconfigure" .
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Optional bridge interface name.
.It Fl B
Detach from the controlling terminal and run as a daemon process
in the background.
.It Fl d
Enable debugging messages.
If this option is supplied twice, more verbose messages are displayed.
.It Fl D
Driver name (can be multiple drivers: nl80211,wext).
.It Fl f
Log output to debug file instead of stdout.
.It Fl g
Global ctrl_interface.
.It Fl h
Show help text.
.It Fl K
Include key information in debugging output.
.It Fl L
Display the license for this program on the terminal and exit.
.It Fl N
Start describing a new interface.
.It Fl o
Overrides driver parameter for new interfaces.
.It Fl O
Override ctrl_interface parameter for new interfaces.
.It Fl p
Specify driver parameters.
.It Fl P
File in which to save the process PID.
.It Fl q
Decrease debugging verbosity (i.e., counteract the use of the
.Fl d
flag).
.It Fl s
Send log messages through
.Xr syslog 3
instead of to the terminal.
.It Fl t
Include timestamp in debug messages.
.It Fl v
Display version information on the terminal and exit.
.It Fl W
Wait for a control interface monitor before starting.
