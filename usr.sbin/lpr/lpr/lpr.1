.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility uses a spooling daemon to print the named files when facilities
become available.
If no names appear, the standard input is assumed.
.Pp
The following single letter options are used to notify the line printer
spooler that the files are not standard text files.
The spooling daemon will
use the appropriate filters to print the data accordingly.
Note that not all spoolers implement filters for all data types,
and some sites may use these types for other purposes than the ones
described here.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
The files are assumed to contain data in
.Tn DVI
format from the
.Tn TeX
typesetting system.
.It Fl f
Use a filter which interprets the first character of each line as a
standard
.Tn FORTRAN
carriage control character.
.It Fl l
Use a filter which allows control characters to be printed and suppresses
page breaks.
.It Fl p
Use
.Xr pr 1
to format the files.
.El
.Pp
The following options are historical and not directly supported by any
software included in
.Fx .
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
The files are assumed to contain data produced by
.Xr cifplot 1 .
.It Fl g
The files are assumed to contain standard plot data as produced by the
.Ux
.Xr plot 3
routines.
.It Fl n
The files are assumed to contain data from
.Em ditroff
(device independent troff).
.It Fl t
The files are assumed to contain
.Tn C/A/T
phototypesetter commands from ancient versions of
.Ux
.Xr troff 1 .
.It Fl v
The files are assumed to contain a raster image for devices like the
Benson Varian.
.El
.Pp
These options apply to the handling of
the print job:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl P
Force output to a specific printer.
Normally,
the default printer is used (site dependent), or the value of the
environment variable
.Ev PRINTER
is used.
.It Fl h
Suppress the printing of the burst page.
.It Fl m
Send mail upon completion.
.It Fl r
Remove the file upon completion of spooling or upon completion of
printing (with the
.Fl s
option).
.It Fl s
Use symbolic links.
Usually files are copied to the spool directory.
The
.Fl s
option will use
.Xr symlink 2
to link data files rather than trying to copy them so large files can be
printed.
This means the files should
not be modified or removed until they have been printed.
.El
.Pp
The remaining options apply to copies, the page display, and headers:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl \&# Ns Ar num
The quantity
.Ar num
is the number of copies desired of each file named.
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lpr \-#3 foo.c bar.c more.c
.Ed
would result in 3 copies of the file foo.c, followed by 3 copies
of the file bar.c, etc.
On the other hand,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cat foo.c bar.c more.c \&| lpr \-#3
.Ed
.Pp
will give three copies of the concatenation of the files.
Often
a site will disable this feature to encourage use of a photocopier
instead.
.It Xo
.Fl Ns Op Cm 1234
.Ar font
.Xc
Specifies a
.Ar font
to be mounted on font position
.Ar i .
The daemon
will construct a
.Li .railmag
file referencing
the font pathname.
.It Fl C Ar class
Job classification
to use on the burst page.
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lpr \-C EECS foo.c
.Ed
.Pp
causes the system name (the name returned by
.Xr hostname 1 )
to be replaced on the burst page by
.Tn EECS ,
and the file foo.c to be printed.
.It Fl J Ar job
Job name to print on the burst page.
Normally, the first file's name is used.
.It Fl L Ar locale
Use
.Ar locale
specified as argument instead of one found in environment.
(Only effective when filtering through
.Xr pr 1
is requested using the
.Fl p
option.)
.It Fl T Ar title
Title name for
.Xr pr 1 ,
instead of the file name.
.It Fl U Ar user
User name to print on the burst page,
also for accounting purposes.
This option is only honored if the real user-id is daemon
(or that specified in the printcap file instead of daemon),
and is intended for those instances where print filters wish to requeue jobs.
.It Fl Z Ar daemon-options
Some spoolers, such as
.Tn LPRng ,
accept additional per-job options using a
.Ql Z
control line.
When
.Fl Z
is specified, and
.Fl p
.Pq Xr pr 1
is not requested, the specified
.Ar daemon-options
will be passed to the remote
.Tn LPRng
spooler.
.It Fl i Ar numcols
The output is indented by
.Pq Ar numcols .
.It Fl w Ar num
Uses
.Ar num
as the page width for
.Xr pr 1 .
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If the following environment variable exists, it is used by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width PRINTER
.It Ev PRINTER
Specifies an alternate default printer.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/spool/output/*/tf* -compact
.It Pa /etc/passwd
Personal identification.
.It Pa /etc/printcap
Printer capabilities data base.
.It Pa /usr/sbin/lpd
Line printer daemons.
.It Pa /var/spool/output/*
Directories used for spooling.
.It Pa /var/spool/output/*/cf*
Daemon control files.
.It Pa /var/spool/output/*/df*
Data files specified in "cf" files.
.It Pa /var/spool/output/*/tf*
Temporary copies of "cf" files.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If you try to spool too large a file, it will be truncated.
The
.Nm
utility will object to printing binary files.
If a user other than root prints a file and spooling is disabled,
.Nm
will print a message saying so and will not put jobs in the queue.
If a connection to
.Xr lpd 8
on the local machine cannot be made,
.Nm
will say that the daemon cannot be started.
Diagnostics may be printed in the daemon's log file
regarding missing spool files by
.Xr lpd 8 .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3 .
.Sh BUGS
Fonts for
.Xr troff 1
and
.Tn TeX
reside on the host with the printer.
It is currently not possible to
use local font libraries.
.Pp
The
.Ql Z
control file line is used for two different purposes; for
standard
.Fx
.Xr lpd 8 ,
it specifies a locale to be passed to
.Xr pr 1 .
For
.Tn LPRng
.Xr lpd 8 ,
it specifies additional options to be interpreted by the spooler's
input and output filters.
When submitting jobs via
.Nm ,
.Fl p
.Fl L Ar locale
is used in the former context, and
.Fl Z Ar daemon-options
is used in the latter.
