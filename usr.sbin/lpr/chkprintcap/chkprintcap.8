.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm chkprintcap
.Nd check validity of entries in the print spooler database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl f Ar printcap
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility scans a
.Xr printcap 5
database
(named by the
.Ar printcap
argument, or by default
.Pa /etc/printcap ) ,
looking for entries which are invalid in one way or another.
The following checks are currently implemented:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
.Sq Li tc=
references were properly expanded
.It
.Sq Li tc=
references did not form a loop
.It
No two printers share the same spool directory
.Sq ( Li sd=
capability).
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits with a status equal to the number of errors encountered before
processing stopped.
(In some cases, processing can stop before the
entire file is scanned.)
.Pp
If the
.Fl d
flag is given,
.Nm
will attempt to create any missing spool directories, giving them
.Sq Li u=rwx,go=rx
(0755) mode, group
.Sq Li daemon ,
and the owner specified by the
.Sq Li du=
capability in the database (default 1, which corresponds to user
.Sq Li daemon ) .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr lpr 1 ,
.Xr printcap 5 ,
.Xr lpd 8
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility was written by
.An Garrett A. Wollman Aq Mt wollman@lcs.mit.edu .
.Sh BUGS
Not enough sanity-checking is done.
At a minimum, the ownership and
mode of the spool directories should also be checked.
Other
parameters whose value could cause
.Xr lpd 8
to fail should be diagnosed.
