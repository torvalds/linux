.Sh NAME
.Nm lpq
.Nd spool queue examination program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lpq
.Op Fl al
.Op Fl P Ns Ar printer
.Op Ar job# ...
.Op Ar user ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm lpq
examines the spooling area used by
.Xr lpd 8
for printing files on the line printer, and reports the status of the
specified jobs or all jobs associated with a user.
.Nm
invoked
without any arguments reports on any jobs currently in the queue.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Report on the local queues for all printers,
rather than just the specified printer.
.It Fl l
Information about each of the files comprising the job entry
is printed.
Normally, only as much information as will fit on one line is displayed.
.It Fl P Ns Ar printer
Specify a particular printer, otherwise the default
line printer is used (or the value of the
.Ev PRINTER
variable in the
environment).
All other arguments supplied are interpreted as user
names or job numbers to filter out only those jobs of interest.
.El
.Pp
For each job submitted (i.e., invocation of
.Xr lpr 1 )
.Nm
reports the user's name, current rank in the queue, the
names of files comprising the job, the job identifier (a number which
may be supplied to
.Xr lprm 1
for removing a specific job), and the total size in bytes.
Job ordering is dependent on
the algorithm used to scan the spooling directory and is supposed
to be
.Tn FIFO
(First In First Out).
File names comprising a job may be unavailable
(when
.Xr lpr 1
is used as a sink in a pipeline) in which case the file is indicated as
.Dq (standard input) .
.Pp
If
.Nm
warns that there is no daemon present (i.e., due to some malfunction), the
.Xr lpc 8
command can be used to restart the printer daemon.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If the following environment variables exist, they are used by
.Nm lpq :
.Bl -tag -width PRINTER
.It Ev COLUMNS
If set to a positive integer,
output is formatted to the given width in columns.
Otherwise,
.Nm
defaults to the terminal width, or 80 columns if the output is not a terminal.
.It Ev PRINTER
Specifies an alternate default printer.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/spool/output/*/lock" -compact
.It Pa /etc/printcap
To determine printer characteristics.
.It Pa /var/spool/*
The spooling directory, as determined from printcap.
.It Pa /var/spool/output/*/cf*
Control files specifying jobs.
.It Pa /var/spool/output/*/lock
The lock file to obtain the currently active job.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Unable to open various files.
The lock file being malformed.
Garbage files when there is no daemon active, but files in the
spooling directory.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr lpr 1 ,
.Xr lprm 1 ,
.Xr lpc 8 ,
.Xr lpd 8
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm lpq
appeared in
.Bx 3 .
.Sh BUGS
Due to the dynamic nature of the information in the spooling directory,
.Nm
may report unreliably.
Output formatting is sensitive to the line length of the terminal;
this can result in widely spaced columns.
