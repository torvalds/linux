.Sh NAME
.Nm lprm
.Nd remove jobs from the line printer spooling queue
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl P Ns Ar printer
.Op Fl
.Op job # ...\&
.Op Ar user ...\&
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility will remove a job, or jobs, from a printer's spool queue.
Since the spooling directory is protected from users, using
.Nm
is normally the only method by which a user may remove a job.
The owner of a job is determined by the user's login name
and host name on the machine where the
.Xr lpr 1
command was invoked.
.Pp
Options and arguments:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl P Ns Ar printer
Specify the queue associated with a specific
.Ar printer
(otherwise the default printer is used).
.It Fl
If a single
.Sq Fl
is given,
.Nm
will remove all jobs which a user
owns.
If the super-user employs this flag, the spool queue will
be emptied entirely.
.It Ar user
Cause
.Nm
to attempt to remove any jobs queued belonging to that user
(or users).
This form of invoking
.Nm
is useful only to the super-user.
.It Ar job\ \&#
A user may dequeue an individual job by specifying its job number.
This number may be obtained from the
.Xr lpq 1
program, e.g.\&
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\&% lpq \-l

1st:ken				[job #013ucbarpa]
	(standard input)	100 bytes
% lprm 13
.Ed
.El
.Pp
If neither arguments or options are given,
.Nm
will delete the currently active job if it is
owned by the user who invoked
.Nm .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility announces the names of any files it removes and is silent if
there are no jobs in the queue which match the request list.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility will kill off an active daemon, if necessary, before removing
any spooling files.
If a daemon is killed, a new one is
automatically restarted upon completion of file removals.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If the following environment variable exists, it is utilized by
.Nm .
.Bl -tag -width PRINTER
.It Ev PRINTER
If the environment variable
.Ev PRINTER
exists,
and a printer has not been specified with the
.Fl P
option,
the default printer is assumed from
.Ev PRINTER .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/spool/*/lock/ -compact
.It Pa /etc/printcap
Printer characteristics file.
.It Pa /var/spool/*
Spooling directories.
.It Pa /var/spool/*/lock
Lock file used to obtain the pid of the current
daemon and the job number of the currently active job.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
``Permission denied" if the user tries to remove files other than his
own.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr lpq 1 ,
.Xr lpr 1 ,
.Xr lpd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
Since there are race conditions possible in the update of the lock file,
the currently active job may be incorrectly identified.
