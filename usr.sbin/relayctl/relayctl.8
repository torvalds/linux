.Sh NAME
.Nm relayctl
.Nd control the relay daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl s Ar socket
.Ar command
.Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program controls the
.Xr relayd 8
daemon.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s Ar socket
Use
.Ar socket
instead of the default
.Pa /var/run/relayd.sock
to communicate with
.Xr relayd 8 .
.El
.Pp
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm host disable Op Ar name | id
Disable a host.
Treat it as though it were always down.
.It Cm host enable Op Ar name | id
Enable the host.
Start checking its health again.
.It Cm load Ar filename
Reload the configuration from the specified file.
.It Cm log brief
Disable verbose debug logging.
.It Cm log verbose
Enable verbose debug logging.
.It Cm monitor
Continuously report any changes in the host checking engine and the
.Xr pf 4
engine.
.It Cm poll
Schedule an immediate check of all hosts.
.It Cm redirect disable Op Ar name | id
Disable a redirection.
If it has
.Xr pf 4
redirection rules installed, remove them.
Mark the redirection's main table and \(en
if applicable \(en disable the backup table as well.
.It Cm redirect enable Op Ar name | id
Enable a redirection.
Mark the redirection's main table and \(en if applicable \(en enable
the backup table as well.
.It Cm reload
Reload the configuration file.
.It Cm show hosts
Show detailed status of hosts and tables.
It will also print the last error for failed host checks;
see the
.Sx DIAGNOSTICS
section below.
.It Cm show redirects
Show detailed status of redirections including the current and average
access statistics.
The statistics will be updated every minute.
Redirections using the
.Ic sticky-address
option will count the number of sticky states,
not the total number of redirected connections.
.It Cm show relays
Show detailed status of relays including the current and average
access statistics.
The statistics will be updated every minute.
.It Cm show routers
Show detailed status of routers including the configured network
routes.
.It Cm show sessions
Dump the complete list of running relay sessions.
.It Cm show summary
Display a list of all relays, redirections, routers, tables, and hosts.
.It Cm table disable Op Ar name | id
Disable a table.
Consider all hosts disabled.
If it is a main table of a redirection which has a non-empty backup table,
swap the contents of the
.Xr pf 4
table with those of the backup table.
.It Cm table enable Op Ar name | id
Enable a table.
Start doing checks for all hosts that aren't individually disabled
again.
.El
.Sh FILES

.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If a host is down and a previous check failed,
.Nm
will display the last error in the output of the
.Cm show hosts
command.
This is especially useful for debugging server or configuration failures.
The following errors will be reported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Em none
No specific error was reported by the check engine.
.Pp
.It Em aborted
All checks were aborted by an external event, like a configuration reload.
.Pp
.It Em interval timeout
The check did not finish in the configured time of an interval.
This can happen if there are too many hosts that have to be checked by
.Xr relayd 8
and can be avoided by increasing the global
.Ic interval
option in
.Xr relayd.conf 5 .
.Pp
.It Em icmp read timeout
.It Em tls read timeout
.It Em tcp read timeout
The check failed because the remote host did not send a reply within
the configured timeout.
.Pp
.It Em icmp write timeout
.It Em tls write timeout
.It Em tcp write timeout
.It Em tls connect timeout
.It Em tcp connect timeout
The check failed because
.Xr relayd 8
was not ready to send the request within the configured timeout.
.Pp
.It Em tls connect error
.It Em tls read error
.It Em tls write error
.It Em tcp connect error
.It Em tcp read failed
.It Em tcp write failed
An I/O error occurred.
This indicates that
.Xr relayd 8
was running low on resources,
file descriptors, or was too busy to run the request.
It can also indicate that a TLS or TCP protocol error occurred or
that the connection was unexpectedly aborted.
.Pp
.It Em tls connect failed
.It Em tcp connect failed
The check failed because the protocol handshake did not succeed in
opening a stateful connection with the remote host.
.Pp
.It Em script failed
The external script executed by the check did not return a valid return code.
.Pp
.It Em send/expect failed
The payload data returned by the remote host did not match the
expected pattern.
.Pp
.It Em http code malformed
.It Em http digest malformed
The remote host did not return a valid HTTP header or body.
.Pp
.It Em http code mismatch
The remote host did not return a matching HTTP error code.
This may indicate a real server problem (a server error, the page was
not found, permission was denied) or a configuration error.
For example, it is a very common mistake that
.Xr relayd 8
was configured to expect a
HTTP 200 OK
status but the host is returning a
HTTP 302 Found
redirection.
See
.Xr relayd.conf 5
for more information on validating the HTTP return code.
.Pp
.It Em http digest mismatch
The remote host did not return the expected content and the computed
digest was different to the configured value.
See
.Xr relayd.conf 5
for more information on validating the digest.
