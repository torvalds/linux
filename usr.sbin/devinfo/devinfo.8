.Nm
.Fl u
.Nm
.Fl p Ar dev Op Fl v
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility, without any arguments, shows the hierarchy of devices available
in the system, starting from the
.Dq nexus
device.
.Pp
The following options are accepted.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl r
Causes hardware resource information (such as IRQ, I/O ports, I/O memory
addresses) to be also listed, under each device that has reserved those resources.
.It Fl u
Displays the same information as with
.Fl r
but sorts by resource type rather than by device, allowing to review the
set of system resources by usage and available resources.
I.e., it lists all
the IRQ consumers together.
.It Fl v
Display all devices in the driver tree, not just those that are attached or
busy.
Without this flag, only those devices that have attached are reported.
This flag also displays verbose information about each device.
.It Fl p Ar dev
Display the path of
.Ar dev
back to the root of the device tree.
