.Sh NAME
.Nm ldom.conf
.Nd Logical Domain configuration
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file to configure logical domains.
.Pp
Domains are defined in the following format:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic domain Ar name Brq ...
Declare a scope for resources assigned to the specified domain.
The scope must be opened and closed with curly braces and contains
one or more of the following keywords, each on a separate line.
A scope with
.Ar name
.Dq primary
configures resources for the primary domain.
If no configuration for the primary domain exists, it is assigned
all CPU and memory resources not used by any guest domains.
.It Ic vcpu Ar number Ns Op : Ns Ar stride
Declare the number of virtual CPUs assigned to a domain.
Optionally a stride can be specified to allocate
.Ar stride
VCPUs at a time but assign only
.Ar number
VCPUs to the domain.
This can be used to distribute virtual CPUs over the available CPU cores.
.It Ic memory Ar bytes
Declare the amount of memory assigned to a domain, in bytes.
.Ar bytes
can be specified with a human-readable scale, using the format described in
.Xr scan_scaled 3 ,
e.g. 512M.
.It Ic iodevice Ar device
Assign the specified PCIe device to the guest domain.
.Ar device
may be either a device path
.Pq Pa /@400/@2/@0/@8
or a pseudonym
.Pq Pa /SYS/MB/PCIE0 .
This keyword can be used multiple times.
.It Ic variable Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
Set the specified NVRAM variable for the domain.
See
.Xr eeprom 8
for a list of OpenPROM variables.
This keyword can be used multiple times.
.It Ic vdisk Ar file Op Ar keyword Ns = Ns Ar value ...
The specified file is used to back a virtual disk of the guest
domain.
.Ar file
can be a block device node or a disk image file created with the
.Cm create-vdisk
command.
This keyword can be used multiple times.
Unless
.Ar boot-device
is set with the
.Cm variable
command, the first disk will be the default boot device.
Valid options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic devalias Ns = Ns Ar name
Alias the virtual disk as
.Ar name .
.El
.It Ic vnet Op Ar keyword Ns = Ns Ar value ...
Assign a
.Xr vnet 4
network interface to the guest domain.
This keyword can be used multiple times.
Valid options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic mac-addr Ns = Ns Ar address
Configure the MAC address of the interface.
.It Ic mtu Ns = Ns Ar number
Configure the MTU of the interface.
.It Ic devalias Ns = Ns Ar name
Alias the interface as
.Ar name .
.El

.Sh EXAMPLES
Define a domain with 12 virtual cores, 4GB memory, two file based virtual disks
and one virtual network interface:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
domain "puffy" {
	vcpu 12
	memory 4G
	vdisk "/home/puffy/vdisk0"
	vdisk "/home/puffy/vdisk1"
	vnet
}
.Ed
.Pp
Define another one with slightly less resources:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
domain "salmah" {
	vcpu 8
	memory 2G
	vdisk "/home/salmah/vdisk0"
	vdisk "/home/salmah/vdisk1"
	vnet
}
.Ed
.Pp
On a machine with 32 cores and 64GB physical memory, this leaves 12 cores and
58GB memory to the primary domain.
.Pp
Use a
.Ar stride
step size to distribute VCPUs:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
domain "marlus" {
	vcpu 2:4
	memory 4G
	vdisk "/home/marlus/vdisk0"
}
.Ed
.Pp
On a machine with eight threads per physical core, this allocates two strides
of four VCPUs each for the guest domain but assigns only two VCPUs to it, i.e.\&
makes it occupy an entire physical core while running on two threads only.

.Sh BUGS
The hypervisor requires a machine dependent amount of physical memory that is
reserved automatically.
Although the Physical Resource Inventory
.Pq PRI
seems to account for this by presenting less available memory, using the entire
amount via
.Ic memory
is not always successful, e.g. the hypervisor would reject the configuration and
fallback to
.Dq factory-default
upon resetting the machine.
.Pp
If in doubt, assign
.Ic memory
to the
.Dq primary
.Ic domain
explicitly,
such that enough memory remains unused for the hypervisor to reserve.
On T4 based machines, 1024 megabytes has proven to suffice.
