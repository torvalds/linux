.Sh NAME
.Nm ldomctl
.Nd Logical Domain management interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ldomctl
.Ar command
.Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is used to manage logical domains on sun4v systems.
It can be used to assign resources to the primary and guest domains,
start and stop guest domains from the primary domain, and to display
information about domains running on the system.
.Pp
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm create-vdisk Fl s Ar size file
Create a virtual disk image with the specified
.Ar file
path and
.Ar size ,
in bytes.
.Ar size
can be specified with a human-readable scale, using the format described in
.Xr scan_scaled 3 ,
e.g. 512M.
.It Cm console Ar domain
Using
.Xr cu 1
connect to the console of the guest domain.
.It Cm delete Ar configuration
Delete the specified configuration from non-volatile storage.
.It Cm download Ar directory
Save a logical domain configuration to non-volatile storage on the
service processor.
The name of the configuration is taken from the name of the
.Ar directory
which must contain files created with the
.Cm init-system
command.
The download is aborted if a configuration with the same name already exists.
Depending on the firmware, the new configuration must be activated explicitly
using the
.Cm select
command.
.It Cm dump
Dump the current configuration from non-volatile storage into the current
working directory.
.It Cm init-system Oo Fl n Oc Ar file
Generate files in the current working directory for a logical domain
configuration
.Ar file
as described in
.Xr ldom.conf 5 .
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.El
.It Cm list
List configurations stored in non-volatile storage.
Indicate the currently running configuration,
and the configuration which will be used next
(after resetting the machine) if it differs from the currently running one.
.It Cm list-io
List available PCIe devices for the configuration in the current directory.
.It Cm panic Oo Fl c Oc Ar domain
Panic a guest domain.
The exact behaviour of this command depends on the OS running in the domain.
For
.Ox
the default behaviour is to enter
.Xr ddb 4 .
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Fl c
Automatically connect to the guest console.
.El
.It Cm select Ar configuration
Select the next logical domain configuration to use
(after resetting the machine).
.It Cm start Oo Fl c Oc Ar domain
Start a guest domain.
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Fl c
Automatically connect to the guest console.
.El
.It Cm status Op Ar domain
Display status information for
.Ar domain ,
or for all domains running on the system.
.It Cm stop Ar domain
Stop a guest domain.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
A system using factory defaults has a single "factory-default" configuration:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ldomctl list
factory-default [current]
.Ed
.Pp
Create a new configuration based on the defaults:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# mkdir factory-default
# cd factory-default
# ldomctl dump
# cd ..
# cp -R factory-default openbsd
# cd openbsd
.Ed
.Pp
A file describing the desired configuration must be created - see
.Xr ldom.conf 5 .
.Pp
Generate a set of configuration files and download to non-volatile storage.
If a configuration with the same name already exists, it must be removed first:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ldomctl init-system ldom.conf
# cd ..
# ldomctl delete openbsd
# ldomctl download openbsd
# ldomctl list
factory-default [current]
openbsd [next]
.Ed
.Pp
Create a virtual disk image for each guest domain:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ldomctl create-vdisk -s 8G /home/puffy/vdisk0
# ldomctl create-vdisk -s 8G /home/salmah/vdisk0
.Ed
.Pp
The minirootfs install media can be used to boot guest domains:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cp miniroot67.img /home/puffy/vdisk1
# cp miniroot67.img /home/salmah/vdisk1
.Ed
.Pp
To have
.Nm
enabled at boot time, use
.Dq rcctl enable ldomd ,
which sets
.Pp
.Dl ldomd_flags=\(dq\(dq
.Pp
in
.Xr rc.conf.local 8 .
.Pp
Halt the primary domain and reset the hardware:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# halt
sc> reset -c	# ALOM
-> reset /SYS	# ILOM
.Ed
.Pp
The machine will now reset and boot into the new configuration.
The primary domain should have less CPUs and memory, since they
are now assigned to the guest domains:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ldomctl status
primary     -         running     OpenBSD running                1%
puffy       ttyV0     running     OpenBoot Primary Boot Loader   8%
salmah      ttyV1     running     OpenBoot Primary Boot Loader  12%
.Ed
.Pp
Configure the
.Xr vnet 4
interfaces for the guest domains.
This example bridges guest domains into the physical network:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig vnet0 up
# ifconfig vnet1 up
# ifconfig bridge0 create
# ifconfig bridge0 add em0 add vnet0 add vnet1 up
.Ed
.Pp
Access the console of the first domain and boot it:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ldomctl console puffy
Connected to /dev/ttyV0 (speed 9600)
{0} ok boot disk1
