Unbound was developed at NLnet Labs by Wouter Wijngaards.

Unbound was architected in January of 2004 by Jakob Schlyter of Kirei 
and Roy Arends of Nominet. VeriSign and EP.Net funded development of 
the prototype, which was built by David Blacka and Matt Larson of VeriSign. 
Late in 2006, NLnet Labs joined the effort, writing an implementation in C 
based on the existing prototype and using experience NLnet Labs gained
during the development of NSD, an authoritative DNS server.

At NLnet Labs, Jelte Jansen, Mark Santcroos and Matthijs Mekking 
reviewed the unbound C sources.
