	  factor (CAMP related issues) in the hundreds.

5 November 2024: Wouter
	- Fix for the serve expired DNSSEC information fix, it would not allow
	  current delegation information be updated in cache. The fix allows
	  current delegation and validation recursion information to be
	  updated, but as a consequence no longer has certain expired
	  information around for later dnssec valid expired responses.
	- Fix to log redis timeout error string on failure.

5 November 2024: Yorgos
	- Fix SETEX check during Redis (re)initialization.

4 November 2024: Wouter
	- Fix redis that during a reload it does not fail if the redis

	  errors and if the server is up checks expiration features.
	- Merge #1167: Makefile.in: fix occasional parallel build failures
	  around bison rule.

	- Merge #871: DNS over QUIC. This adds `quic-port: 853` and
	  `quic-size: 8m` that enable dnsoverquic, and the counters
	  `num.query.quic` and `mem.quic` in the statistics output.
	  The feature needs to be enabled by compiling with libngtcp2,
	  with `--with-libngtcp2=path` and libngtcp2 needs openssl+quic,
	  pass that with `--with-ssl=path` to compile unbound as well.
	- Fix to limit NSEC TTL for messages from cachedb. Fix to limit the
	  prefetch ttl for messages after a CNAME with short TTL.

	- Fix dns64 with prefetch that the prefetch is stored in cache.

23 September 2024: Yorgos

23 August 2024: Wouter
	- Merge patch to fix for glue that is outside of zone, with
	  `harden-unverified-glue`, from Karthik Umashankar (Microsoft).
	  Enabling this option protects the Unbound resolver against bad
	  glue, that is unverified out of zone glue, by resolving them.
	  It uses the records as last resort if there is no other working
	  glue.
	- Fix #1127: error: "memory exhausted" when defining more than 9994
	  local-zones.
	- Fix documentation for cache_fill_missing function.

	  Anat Bremler-Barr, Shoham Danino and Yuval Shavitt (Tel-Aviv
	  University and Reichman University).

	- Fix that for windows the module startup is called and sets up
	  the module-config.

2 August 2024: Wouter
	- Fix that alloc stats has strdup checks, it stops debuggers from
	  complaining about mismatch at free time.
	- Fix testbound for alloc stats strdup in util/alloc.c.
	- Merge #1090: Cookie secret file. Adds
	  `cookie-secret-file: "unbound_cookiesecrets.txt"` option to store
	  cookie secrets for EDNS COOKIE secret rollover. The remote control
	  add_cookie_secret, activate_cookie_secret and drop_cookie_secret
	  commands can be used for rollover, the command print_cookie_secrets
	  shows the values in use.
	- Fix that alloc stats for forwards and hints are printed, and when
	  alloc stats is enabled, the unit test for unbound control waits for
	  reloads to complete.

1 August 2024: Wouter
	- Fix dnstap test program, cleans up to have clean memory on exit,
	  for tap_data_free, does not delete NULL items. Also it does not try
	  to free the tail, specifically in the free of the list since that
	  picked up the next item in the list for its loop causing invalid
	  free. Added internal unit test to unbound-dnstap-socket for that.
	- Fix that the worker mem report with alloc stats does not attempt
	  to print memory use of forwards and hints if they have been
	  deleted already.

31 July 2024: Wouter
	- Fix for #1114: Fix that cache fill for forward-host names is
	  performed, so that with nonzero target-fetch-policy it fetches
	  forwarder addresses and uses them from cache. Also updated that
	  delegation point cache fill routines use CDflag for AAAA message
	  lookups, so that its negative lookup stops a recursion since the
	  cache uses the bit for disambiguation for dns64 but the recursion
	  uses CDflag for the AAAA target lookups, so the check correctly
	  stops a useless recursion by its cache lookup.

30 July 2024: Wouter
	- Fix to document parameters of auth_zone_verify_zonemd_with_key.

25 July 2024: Wouter
	- Add root key 38696 from 2024 for DNSSEC validation. It is added

	  attribute.
	- Fix to have empty definition when not supported for weak attribute.
	- Fix uninitialized variable warning in create_tcp_accept_sock.
	- Fix link of dnstap without openssl.
	- Fix link of unbound-dnstap-socket without openssl.

19 July 2024: Wouter
	- Add dnstap-sample-rate that logs only 1/N messages, for high volume
	  server environments. Thanks Dan Luther.
	- Fix dnstap wakeup, a running wakeup timer is left to expire and not
	  increased, a timer is started when the dtio thread is sleeping,
	  the timer set disabled when the dtio thread goes to sleep, and
	  after sleep the thread checks to see if there are messages to log
	  immediately.

16 July 2024: Wouter
	- For #1103: Fix to drop mesh state reference for the http2 stream
	  associated with the reply, not the currently active stream. And
	  it does not remove it twice on a mesh_send_reply call. The reply
	  h2_stream is NULL when not in use, for more initialisation.

15 July 2024: Wouter
	- For #1103: fix to also drop mesh state reference when the discard
	  limit is reached, when there is an error making a new recursion
	  state and when the connection is dropped with is_drop.

12 July 2024: Yorgos
	- Add RPZ tag tests in acl_interface.tdir.
	- For #1102: clearer text for using interface-* options for the

	  when validation fails due to the missing DNSKEY. Also for key prime
	  and DS lookups.

3 July 2024: Yorgos
	- Fix for repeated use of a DNAME record: first overallocate and then

	- Merge PR #164: Framestreams, this branch implements dnstap
	  unidirectional connectivity in unbound. This has a number of
	  new features.

	  The dependency on libfstrm is removed. The fstrm protocol code
	  resides in dnstap/dnstap_fstrm.h and dnstap/dnstap_fstrm.c. This
	  contains a brief definition of what unbound needs.

	  The make unbound-dnstap-socket builds a debug tool,
	  unbound-dnstap-socket. It can listen, accept multiple DNSTAP
	  streams and print information. Commandline options control it.

	  Unbound can reconnect if the unix domain socket file socket is
	  closed. This uses exponential backoff after which it uses a
	  one second timer to throttle cpu down. There is also support
	  to use TCP and TLS for connecting to the log server. There
	  are new config options to turn them on, in the dnstap section
	  in the man page and example config file. dnstap-ip with IP
	  address of server for TCP or TLS use. dnstap-tls to turn
	  on TLS. And dnstap-tls-server-name, dnstap-tls-cert-bundle,
	  dnstap-tls-client-key-file and dnstap-tls-client-cert-file
	  to configure the certificates for server authentication and
	  client authentication, or leave at "" to not use that.

	  to be reset by the TCP time measurement (that exists for TLS),
	  because that causes the UDP part to not be measured as timeout.
	- Fix #4156: Fix systemd service manager state change notification.

13 September 2018: Wouter
	- Fix seed for random backup code to use explicit zero when wiped.

	- Disable minimal-responses in ipsecmod unit tests.
	- Added serve-expired-ttl and serve-expired-ttl-reset options.

27 August 2018: Wouter
	- Set defaults to yes for a number of options to increase speed and
	  resilience of the server.  The so-reuseport, harden-below-nxdomain,
	  and minimal-responses options are enabled by default.  They used
	  to be disabled by default, waiting to make sure they worked.  They
	  are enabled by default now, and can be disabled explicitly by
	  setting them to "no" in the unbound.conf config file.  The reuseport
	  and minimal options increases speed of the server, and should be
	  otherwise harmless.  The harden-below-nxdomain option works well
	  together with the recently default enabled qname minimisation, this
	  causes more fetches to use information from the cache.
	- next release is called 1.8.0.
	- Fix lintflags for lint on FreeBSD.

22 August 2018: George
	- #4140: Expose repinfo (comm_reply) to the inplace_callbacks. This

	  necessary.

21 August 2018: Wouter

17 August 2018: Wouter
	- Set libunbound to increase current, because the libunbound change
	  to the event callback function signature.  That needs programs,
	  that use it, to recompile against the new header definition.
	- print servfail info to log as error.
	- added more servfail printout statements, to the iterator.
	- log-servfail: yes prints log lines that say why queries are

	  'RestrictAddressFamilies' (without it IPV6 can't work). From
	  Guido Shanahan.
	- Patch to implement tcp-connection-limit from Jim Hague (Sinodun).
	  This limits the number of simultaneous TCP client connections
	  from a nominated netblock.
	- make depend, yacc, lex, doc, headers.  And log the limit exceeded
	  message only on high verbosity, so as to not spam the logs when
	  it is busy.

6 August 2018: Wouter
	- Fix for #4136: Fix to unconditionally call destroy in daemon.c.

3 August 2018: George
	- Expose if a query (or a subquery) was ratelimited (not src IP
	  ratelimiting) to libunbound under 'ub_result.was_ratelimited'.

	  libunbound/unbound-event.h.
	- Tidy pylib tests.

3 August 2018: Wouter
	- Revert previous change for #4136: because it introduces build

	- Patches from Jim Hague (Sinodun) for EDNS KeepAlive.
	- Sort out test runs when the build directory isn't the project
	  root directory.
	- Add config tcp-idle-timeout (default 30s). This applies to
	  client connections only; the timeout on TCP connections upstream
	  is unaffected.
	- Error if EDNS Keepalive received over UDP.
	- Add edns-tcp-keepalive and edns-tcp-keepalive timeout options
	  and implement option in client responses.

	  duplicates
	- [dnscrypt] introduce dnscrypt-provider-cert-rotated option,
	  from Manu Bretelle.
	This option allows handling multiple cert/key pairs while only
	distributing some of them.
	In order to reliably match a client magic with a given key without
	strong assumption as to how those were generated, we need both key and
	cert. Likewise, in order to know which ES version should be used.
	On the other hand, when rotating a cert, it can be desirable to only
	serve the new cert but still be able to handle clients that are still
	using the old certs's public key.
	The `dnscrypt-provider-cert-rotated` allow to instruct unbound to not
	publish the cert as part of the DNS's provider_name's TXT answer.

	- Libunbound skips dos-line-endings from etc/hosts.
	- Unbound exits with a fatal error when the auto-trust-anchor-file
	  fails to be writable.  This is seconds after startup.  You can
	  load a readonly auto-trust-anchor-file with trust-anchor-file.
	  The file has to be writable to notice the trust anchor change,
	  without it, a trust anchor change will be unnoticed and the system
	  will then become inoperable.

	  inability to find nameservers does not fail equality comparisons,
	  many nameservers does not try to compare more than max-sent-count,
	  parse failures start 0x20 fallback procedure.
	- store caps_response with best response in case downgrade response
	  happens to be the last one.
	- Document windows 8 tests.

	  prefix and sysconfdir from the configure script.  Also fix the
	  umask to match the comment, and the comment to match the umask.
	  Add const and static where needed.  Use unions instead of
	  playing pointer poker.  Move declarations that are needed in
	  multiple source files into a shared header.  Move sldns_bgetc()
	  from parse.c to buffer.c where it belongs.  Introduce a new
	  header file, worker.h, which declares the callbacks that
	  all workers must define.  Remove those declarations from
	  libworker.h.	Include the correct headers in the correct places.
	  Fix a few dummy callbacks that don't match their prototype.
	  Fix some casts.  Hide the sbrk madness behind #ifdef HAVE_SBRK.
	  Remove a useless printf which breaks reproducible builds.
	  Get rid of CONFIGURE_{TARGET,DATE,BUILD_WITH} now that they're
	  no longer used.  Add unbound-control-setup.sh to the list of
	  generated files.  The prototype for libworker_event_done_cb()

29 April 2014: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.
	- Add unbound-control flush_negative that flushed nxdomains, nodata,
	  and errors from the cache.  For dnssec-trigger and NetworkManager,
	  fixes cases where network changes have localdata that was already
	  negatively cached from the previous network.

23 April 2014: Wouter
	- Patch from Jeremie Courreges-Anglas to use arc4random_uniform

	- iana portlist updated.

20 February 2014: Matthijs
	- Be lenient when a NSEC NameError response with RCODE=NXDOMAIN is
	  received. This is okay according 4035, but not after revising
	  existence in 4592.  NSEC empty non-terminals exist and thus the
	  RCODE should have been NOERROR. If this occurs, and the RRsets
	  are secure, we set the RCODE to NOERROR and the security status
	  of the response is also considered secure.

14 February 2014: Wouter
	- Works on Minix (3.2.1).

	  parse sldns.

30 January 2014: Wouter

	  it does not make a socketdrain DoS easier.

28 January 2014: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.
	- iana portlist test updated so it does not touch the source
	  if there are no changes.
	- delay-close: msec option that delays closing ports for which
	  the UDP reply has timed out.  Keeps the port open, only accepts
	  the correct reply.  This correct reply is not used, but the port
	  is open so that no port-denied ICMPs are generated.

27 January 2014: Wouter
	- reuseport is attempted, then fallback to without on failure.

24 January 2014: Wouter

	- so-reuseport: yesno option to distribute queries evenly over
	  threads on Linux (Thanks Robert Edmonds).
	- made lint clean.

21 January 2014: Wouter
	- Fix #547: no trustanchor written if filesystem full, fclose checked.

	  more specific interface port 53 can be used at the same time, and
	  one of the daemons is unbound.

	- separate ldns into core ldns inside ldns/ subdirectory.  No more
	  --with-ldns is needed and unbound does not rely on libldns.
	- portability fixes for new USE_SLDNS ldns subdir codebase.

22 Oct 2013: Wouter
	- Patch from Neel Goyal: Add an API call to set an event base on an
	  existing ub_ctx.  This basically just destroys the current worker and
	  sets the event base to the current.  And fix a deadlock in
	  ub_resolve_event – the cfglock is held when libworker_create is
	  called.  This ends up trying to acquire the lock again in
	  context_obtain_alloc in the call chain.
	- Fix #528: if very high logging (4 or more) segfault on allow_snoop.

26 Sep 2013: Wouter
	- unbound-event.h is installed if configured --with-libevent.  It
	  contains low-level library calls, that use libevent's event_base

	  logs, high verbosity will show them.

16 February 2012: Wouter
	- iter_hints is now thread-owned in module env, and thus threadsafe.
	- Fix prefetch and sticky NS, now the prefetch works.  It picks
	  nameservers that 'would be valid in the future', and if this makes
	  the NS timeout, it updates that NS by asking delegation from the
	  parent again.  If child NS has longer TTL, that TTL does not get
	  refreshed from the lookup to the child nameserver.

15 February 2012: Wouter
	- Fix forward-zone memory, uses malloc and frees original root dp.
	- iter hints (stubs) uses malloc inside for more dynamicity.
	- unbound-control forward_add, forward_remove, stub_add, stub_remove

	- implement draft-ietf-dnsext-ecdsa-04; which is in IETF LC; This
	  implementation is experimental at this time and not recommended
	  for use on the public internet (the protocol numbers have not
	  been assigned).  Needs recent ldns with --enable-ecdsa.
	- fix memory leak in errorcase for DSA signatures.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- workaround for openssl 0.9.8 ecdsa sha2 and evp problem.

	- 1.4.16 release tag.
	- svn trunk is 1.4.17 in development.
	- iana portlist updated.

1 February 2012: Wouter
	- Fix validation failures (like: validation failure xx: no NSEC3
	  closest encloser from yy for DS zz. while building chain of trust,
	  because of a bug in the TTL-fix in 1.4.15, it picked the wrong rdata
	  for an NSEC3.  Now it does not change rdata, and fixes TTL.

30 January 2012: Wouter
	- Fix version-number in libtool to be version-info so it produces
	  libunbound.so.2 like it should.

26 January 2012: Wouter

	- Fix memset in test code.

20 January 2012: Wouter
	- Fix bug #424: compile on OpenIndiana OS with gcc 4.6.2.

19 January 2012: Wouter
	- Fix to write key files completely to a temporary file, and if that
	  succeeds, replace the real key file.  So failures leave a useful file.

18 January 2012: Wouter
	- tag 1.4.15rc1 created
	- updated libunbound/ubsyms.def and remade tag 1.4.15rc1.

17 January 2012: Wouter
	- Fix bug where canonical_compare of RRSIG did not downcase the
	  signer-name.  This is mostly harmless because RRSIGs do not have
	  to be sorted in canonical order, usually.

12 January 2012: Wouter
	- bug#428: add ub_version() call to libunbound.  API version increase,
	  with (binary) backwards compatibility for the previous version.

10 January 2012: Wouter
	- Fix bug #425: unbound reports wrong TTL in reply, it reports a TTL
	  that would be permissible by the RFCs but it is not the TTL in the
	  cache.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- uninitialised variable in reprobe for rtt blocked domains fixed.
	- lintfix and new flex output.

24 December 2011: Wouter
	- Fix for memory leak (about 20 bytes when a tcp or udp send operation
	  towards authority servers failed, takes about 50.000 such failures to
	  leak one Mb, such failures are also usually logged), reported by
	  Robert Fleischmann.
	- iana portlist updated.

19 December 2011: Wouter
	- Fix for VU#209659 CVE-2011-4528: Unbound denial of service

	  ssl-service.pem.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- fix -flto detection on Lion for llvm-gcc.

31 October 2011: Wouter
	- dns over ssl support, ssl-service-pem and ssl-service-key files
	  can be given and then TCP queries are serviced wrapped in SSL.

27 October 2011: Wouter
	- lame-ttl and lame-size options no longer exist, it is integrated
	  with the host info.  They are ignored (with verbose warning) if
	  encountered to keep the config file backwards compatible.
	- fix iana-update for changing gzip compression of results.
	- fix export-all-symbols on OSX.

26 October 2011: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.
	- Infra cache stores information about ping and lameness per IP, zone.
	  This fixes bug #416.
	- fix iana_update target for gzipped file on iana site.

24 October 2011: Wouter
	- Fix resolve of partners.extranet.microsoft.com with a fix for the
	  server selection for choosing out of a (particular) list of bad
	  choices. (bug#415)
	- Fix make_new_space function so that the incoming query is not
	  overwritten if a jostled out query causes a waiting query to be
	  resumed that then fails and sends an error message.  (Thanks to
	  Matthew Lee).

21 October 2011: Wouter
	- fix --enable-allsymbols, fptr wlist is disabled on windows with this 
	  option enabled because of memory layout exe vs dll.

19 October 2011: Wouter
	- fix unbound-anchor for broken strptime on OSX lion, detected
	  in configure.

	- better documentation for inform_super (Thanks Yang Zhe).

14 October 2011: Wouter
	- Fix for out-of-memory condition in libunbound (thanks
	  Robert Fleischman).

13 October 2011: Wouter
	- Fix --enable-allsymbols, it depended on link specifics of the
	  target platform, or fptr_wlist assertion failures could occur.

12 October 2011: Wouter
	- updated contrib/unbound_munin_ to family=auto so that it works with
	  munin-node-configure automatically (if installed as
	  /usr/local/share/munin/plugins/unbound_munin_ ).

27 September 2011: Wouter
	- unbound.exe -w windows option for start and stop service.

23 September 2011: Wouter
	- TCP-upstream calculates tcp-ping so server selection works if there
	  are alternatives.

20 September 2011: Wouter
	- Fix classification of NS set in answer section, where there is a
	  parent-child server, and the answer has the AA flag for dir.slb.com.
	  Thanks to Amanda Constant from Secure64.

16 September 2011: Wouter
	- fix bug #408: accept patch from Steve Snyder that comments out
	  unused functions in lookup3.c.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- fix EDNS1480 change memleak and TCP fallback.
	- fix various compiler warnings (reported by Paul Wouters).
	- max sent count.  EDNS1480 only for rtt < 5000.  No promiscuous
	  fetch if sentcount > 3, stop query if sentcount > 16.  Count is
	  reset when referral or CNAME happens.  This makes unbound better
	  at managing large NS sets, they are explored when there is continued
	  interest (in the form of queries).

15 September 2011: Wouter
	- release 1.4.13.
	- trunk contains 1.4.14 in development.
	- Unbound probes at EDNS1480 if there an EDNS0 timeout.

12 September 2011: Wouter
	- Reverted dns EDNS backoff fix, it did not help and needs
	  fragmentation fixes instead.
	- tag 1.4.13rc2

7 September 2011: Wouter
	- Fix operation in ipv6 only (do-ip4: no) mode.

6 September 2011: Wouter
	- fedora specfile updated.

5 September 2011: Wouter
	- tag 1.4.13rc1

2 September 2011: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.

26 August 2011: Wouter
	- Fix num-threads 0 does not segfault, reported by Simon Deziel.
	- Fix validation failures due to EDNS backoff retries, the retry
	  for fetch of data has want_dnssec because the iter_indicate_dnssec
	  function returns true when validation failure retry happens, and
	  then the serviced query code does not fallback to noEDNS, even if
	  the cache says it has this.  This helps for DLV deployment when
	  the DNSSEC status is not known for sure before the lookup concludes.

24 August 2011: Wouter
	- Applied patch from Karel Slany that fixes a memory leak in the
	  unbound python module, in string conversions.

22 August 2011: Wouter
	- Fix validation of qtype ANY responses with CNAMEs (thanks Cathy
	  Zhang and Luo Ce).  Unbound responds with the RR types that are
	  available at the name for qtype ANY and validates those RR types.
	  It does not test for completeness (i.e. with NSEC or NSEC3 query),
	  and it does not follow the CNAME or DNAME to another name (with
	  even more data for the already large response).
	- Fix that internally, CNAMEs with NXDOMAIN have that as rcode.
	- Documented the options that work with control set_option command.
	- tcp-upstream yes/no option (works with set_option) for tunnels.

18 August 2011: Wouter
	- fix autoconf call in makedist crosscompile to RC or snapshot.

17 August 2011: Wouter

	- new xml format at IANA, new awk for iana_update.
	- iana portlist updated.

10 August 2011: Wouter
	- Fix python site-packages path to /usr/lib64.
	- updated patch from Tom.
	- fix memory and fd leak after out-of-memory condition.

	- patch from Tom Hendrikx fixes load of python modules.

8 August 2011: Wouter
	- make clean had ldns-src reference, removed.

1 August 2011: Wouter
	- Fix autoconf 2.68 warnings

14 July 2011: Wouter
	- Unbound implements RFC6303 (since version 1.4.7).
	- tag 1.4.12rc1 is released as 1.4.12 (without the other fixes in the
	  meantime, those are for 1.4.13).
	- iana portlist updated.

13 July 2011: Wouter
	- Quick fix for contrib/unbound.spec example, no ldns-builtin any more.

11 July 2011: Wouter
	- Fix wildcard expansion no-data reply under an optout NSEC3 zone is
	  validated as insecure, reported by Jia Li (lijia@cnnic.cn).

4 July 2011: Wouter
	- 1.4.12rc1 tag created.

1 July 2011: Wouter
	- version number in example config file.
	- fix that --enable-static-exe does not complain about it unknown.

30 June 2011: Wouter
	- tag relase 1.4.11, trunk is 1.4.12 development.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- fix bug#395: id bits of other query may leak out under conditions
	- fix replyaddr count wrong after jostled queries, which leads to
	  eventual starvation where the daemon has no replyaddrs left to use.
	- fix comment about rndc port, that referred to the old port number.
	- fix that the listening socket is not closed when too many remote
	  control connections are made at the same time.
	- removed ldns-src tarball inside the unbound tarball.

23 June 2011: Wouter
	- Changed -flto check to support clang compiler.
	- tag 1.4.11rc3 created.

17 June 2011: Wouter
	- tag 1.4.11rc1 created.
	- remove warning about signed/unsigned from flex (other flex version).
	- updated aclocal.m4 and libtool to match.
	- tag 1.4.11rc2 created.

16 June 2011: Wouter
	- log-queries: yesno option, default is no, prints querylog.
	- version is 1.4.11.

14 June 2011: Wouter
	- Use -flto compiler flag for link time optimization, if supported.
	- iana portlist updated.

12 June 2011: Wouter
	- IPv6 service address for d.root-servers.net (2001:500:2D::D).

10 June 2011: Wouter
	- unbound-control has version number in the header,
	  UBCT[version]_space_ is the header sent by the client now.
	- Unbound control port number is registered with IANA:
	  ub-dns-control  8953/tcp    unbound dns nameserver control
	  This is the new default for the control-port config setting.
	- statistics-interval prints the number of jostled queries to log.

30 May 2011: Wouter
	- Fix Makefile for U in environment, since wrong U is more common than
	  deansification necessity.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- updated ldns tarball to 1.6.10rc2 snapshot of today.

25 May 2011: Wouter
	- Fix assertion failure when unbound generates an empty error reply
	  in response to a query, CVE-2011-1922 VU#531342.
	- This fix is in tag 1.4.10.
	- defense in depth against the above bug, an error is printed to log
	  instead of an assertion failure.

10 May 2011: Wouter
	- bug#386: --enable-allsymbols option links all binaries to libunbound
	  and reduces install size significantly.
	- feature, ignore-cd-flag: yesno to provide dnssec to legacy servers.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- Fix TTL of SOA so negative TTL is separately cached from normal TTL.

14 April 2011: Wouter
	- configure created with newer autoconf 2.66.

12 April 2011: Wouter
	- bug#378: Fix that configure checks for ldns_get_random presence.

8 April 2011: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.
	- queries with CD flag set cause DNSSEC validation, but the answer is
	  not withheld if it is bogus.  Thus, unbound will retry if it is bad
	  and curb the TTL if it is bad, thus protecting the cache for use by
	  downstream validators.
	- val-override-date: -1 ignores dates entirely, for NTP usage.

29 March 2011: Wouter
	- harden-below-nxdomain: changed so that it activates when the
	  cached nxdomain is dnssec secure.  This avoids backwards
	  incompatibility because those old servers do not have dnssec.

24 March 2011: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.
	- release 1.4.9.
	- trunk is 1.5.0

17 March 2011: Wouter

	- tag 1.4.9 release candidate 1 created.

3 March 2011: Wouter
	- updated ldns to today.

1 March 2011: Wouter
	- Fix no ADflag for NXDOMAIN in NSEC3 optout. And wildcard in optout.
	- give config parse error for multiple names on a stub or forward zone.
	- updated ldns tarball to 1.6.9(todays snapshot).

	- iana portlist updated.
	- tpkg updated with common.sh for common functionality.

28 January 2011: Wouter
	- Fix remove private address does not throw away entire response.

24 January 2011: Wouter
	- release 1.4.8

19 January 2011: Wouter
	- fix bug#349: no -L/usr for ldns.

18 January 2011: Wouter
	- ldns 1.6.8 tarball included.
	- release 1.4.8rc1.

17 January 2011: Wouter
	- add get and set option for harden-below-nxdomain feature.
	- iana portlist updated.

14 January 2011: Wouter
	- Fix so a changed NS RRset does not get moved name stuck on old
	  server, for type NS the TTL is not increased.

13 January 2011: Wouter
	- Fix prefetch so it does not get stuck on old server for moved names.

12 January 2011: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.

11 January 2011: Wouter
	- Fix insecure CNAME sequence marked as secure, reported by Bert
	  Hubert.

10 January 2011: Wouter
	- faster lruhash get_mem routine.

4 January 2011: Wouter
	- bug#346: remove ITAR scripts from contrib, the service is discontinued, use the root.
	- iana portlist updated.

23 December 2010: Wouter
	- Fix in infra cache that could cause rto larger than TOP_TIMEOUT kept.

21 December 2010: Wouter
	- algorithm compromise protection using the algorithms signalled in
	  the DS record.  Also, trust anchors, DLV, and RFC5011 receive this,
	  and thus, if you have multiple algorithms in your trust-anchor-file
	  then it will now behave different than before.  Also, 5011 rollover
	  for algorithms needs to be double-signature until the old algorithm
	  is revoked.
	  It is not an option, because I see no use to turn the security off.
	- iana portlist updated.

17 December 2010: Wouter
	- squelch 'tcp connect: bla' in logfile, (set verbosity 2 to see them).
	- fix validation in this case: CNAME to nodata for co-hosted opt-in
	  NSEC3 insecure delegation, was bogus, fixed to be insecure.

16 December 2010: Wouter
	- Fix our 'BDS' license (typo reported by Xavier Belanger).

	- iana portlist updated.

18 November 2010: Wouter
	- harden-below-nxdomain option, default off (because very old
	  software may be incompatible).  We could enable it by default in
	  the future.

17 November 2010: Wouter
	- implement draft-vixie-dnsext-resimprove-00, we stop on NXDOMAIN.
	- make test output nicer.

15 November 2010: Wouter
	- silence 'tcp connect: broken pipe' and 'net down' at low verbosity.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- so-sndbuf option for very busy servers, a bit like so-rcvbuf.

9 November 2010: Wouter
	- unbound-anchor compiles with openssl 0.9.7.

8 November 2010: Wouter
	- release tag 1.4.7.
	- trunk is version 1.4.8.
	- Be lenient and accept imgw.pl malformed packet (like BIND).

5 November 2010: Wouter
	- do not synthesize a CNAME message from cache for qtype DS.

4 November 2010: Wouter
	- Use central entropy to seed threads.

3 November 2010: Wouter
	- Change the rtt used to probe EDNS-timeout hosts to 1000 msec.

2 November 2010: Wouter
	- tag 1.4.7rc1.
	- code review.

1 November 2010: Wouter
	- GOST code enabled by default (RFC 5933).

27 October 2010: Wouter
	- Fix uninit value in dump_infra print.
	- Fix validation failure for parent and child on same server with an
	  insecure childzone and a CNAME from parent to child.
	- Configure detects libev-4.00.

26 October 2010: Wouter
	- dump_infra and flush_infra commands for unbound-control.
	- no timeout backoff if meanwhile a query succeeded.
	- Change of timeout code.  No more lost and backoff in blockage.
	  At 12sec timeout (and at least 2x lost before) one probe per IP
	  is allowed only.  At 120sec, the IP is blocked.  After 15min, a
	  120sec entry has a single retry packet.

25 October 2010: Wouter
	- Configure errors if ldns is not found.

22 October 2010: Wouter
	- Windows 7 fix for the installer.

21 October 2010: Wouter
	- Fix bug where fallback_tcp causes wrong roundtrip and edns
	  observation to be noted in cache.  Fix bug where EDNSprobe halted
	  exponential backoff if EDNS status unknown.
	- new unresponsive host method, exponentially increasing block backoff.
	- iana portlist updated.

20 October 2010: Wouter
	- interface automatic works for some people with ip6 disabled.
	  Therefore the error check is removed, so they can use the option.

19 October 2010: Wouter
	- Fix for request list growth, if a server has long timeout but the
	  lost counter is low, then its effective rtt is the one without
	  exponential backoff applied.  Because the backoff is not working.
	  The lost counter can then increase and the server is blacklisted,
	  or the lost counter does not increase and the server is working
	  for some queries.

18 October 2010: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.

13 October 2010: Wouter
	- Fix TCP so it uses a random outgoing-interface.
	- unbound-anchor handles ADDPEND keystate.

11 October 2010: Wouter
	- Fix bug when DLV below a trust-anchor that uses NSEC3 optout where
	  the zone has a secure delegation hosted on the same server did not
	  verify as secure (it was insecure by mistake).
	- iana portlist updated.
	- ldns tarball updated (for reading cachedumps with bad RR data).

1 October 2010: Wouter
	- test for unbound-anchor. fix for reading certs.
	- Fix alloc_reg_release for longer uptime in out of memory conditions.

28 September 2010: Wouter
	- unbound-anchor working, it creates or updates a root.key file.
	  Use it before you start the validator (e.g. at system boot time).

27 September 2010: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.

24 September 2010: Wouter
	- bug#329: in example.conf show correct ipv4 link-local 169.254/16.

23 September 2010: Wouter
	- unbound-anchor app, unbound requires libexpat (xml parser library).

22 September 2010: Wouter
	- compliance with draft-ietf-dnsop-default-local-zones-14, removed
	  reverse ipv6 orchid prefix from builtin list.
	- iana portlist updated.

17 September 2010: Wouter
	- DLV has downgrade protection again, because the RFC says so.
	- iana portlist updated.

16 September 2010: Wouter
	- Algorithm rollover operational reality intrudes, for trust-anchor,
	  5011-store, and DLV-anchor if one key matches it's good enough.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- Fix reported validation error in out of memory condition.

15 September 2010: Wouter
	- Abide RFC5155 section 9.2: no AD flag for replies with NSEC3 optout.

14 September 2010: Wouter
	- increased mesh-max-activation from 1000 to 3000 for crazy domains
	  like _tcp.slb.com with 262 servers.
	- iana portlist updated.

13 September 2010: Wouter
	- bug#327: Fix for cannot access stub zones until the root is primed.

9 September 2010: Wouter
	- unresponsive servers are not completely blacklisted (because of
	  firewalls), but also not probed all the time (because of the request
	  list size it generates).  The probe rate is 1%.
	- iana portlist updated.

20 August 2010: Wouter
	- openbsd-lint fixes: acl_list_get_mem used if debug-alloc enabled.
	  iterator get_mem includes priv_get_mem.  delegpt nodup removed.
	  listen_pushback, query_info_allocqname, write_socket, send_packet,
	  comm_point_set_cb_arg and listen_resume removed.

19 August 2010: Wouter
	- Fix bug#321: resolution of rs.ripe.net artifacts with 0x20.
	  Delegpt structures checked for duplicates always.
	  No more nameserver lookups generated when depth is full anyway.
	- example.conf notes how to do DNSSEC validation and track the root.
	- iana portlist updated.

18 August 2010: Wouter
	- Fix bug#322: configure does not respect CFLAGS on Solaris.
	  Pass CFLAGS="-xO4 -xtarget=generic" on the configure command line
	  if use sun-cc, but some systems need different flags.

16 August 2010: Wouter
	- Fix acx_nlnetlabs.m4 configure output for autoconf-2.66 AS_TR_CPP
	  changes, uses m4_bpatsubst now.
	- make test (or make check) should be more portable and run the unit 
	  test and testbound scripts. (make longtest has special requirements).

13 August 2010: Wouter
	- More pleasant remote control command parsing.
	- documentation added for return values reported by doxygen 1.7.1.
	- iana portlist updated.

9 August 2010: Wouter
	- Fix name of rrset printed that failed validation.

5 August 2010: Wouter
	- Return NXDOMAIN after chain of CNAMEs ends at name-not-found.

4 August 2010: Wouter
	- Fix validation in case a trust anchor enters into a zone with
	  unsupported algorithms.

3 August 2010: Wouter
	- updated ldns tarball with bugfixes.
	- release tag 1.4.6.
	- trunk becomes 1.4.7 develop.
	- iana portlist updated.

22 July 2010: Wouter
	- more error details on failed remote control connection.

15 July 2010: Wouter
	- rlimit adjustments for select and ulimit can happen at the same time.

14 July 2010: Wouter
	- Donation text added to README.
	- Fix integer underflow in prefetch ttl creation from cache.  This
	  fixes a potential negative prefetch ttl.

12 July 2010: Wouter
	- Changed the defaults for num-queries-per-thread/outgoing-range.
	  For builtin-select: 512/960, for libevent 1024/4096 and for
	  windows 24/48 (because of win api).  This makes the ratio this way
	  to improve resilience under heavy load.  For high performance, use
	  libevent and possibly higher numbers.

10 July 2010: Wouter
	- GOST enabled if SSL is recent and ldns has GOST enabled too.
	- ldns tarball updated.

9 July 2010: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.
	- Fix validation of qtype DNSKEY when a key-cache entry exists but
	  no rr-cache entry is used (it expired or prefetch), it then goes
	  back up to the DS or trust-anchor to validate the DNSKEY.

7 July 2010: Wouter
	- Neat function prototypes, unshadowed local declarations.

6 July 2010: Wouter
	- failure to chown the pidfile is not fatal any more.
	- testbound uses UTC timezone.
	- ldns tarball updated (ports and works on Minix 3.1.7).  On Minix, add
	  /usr/gnu/bin to PATH, use ./configure AR=/usr/gnu/bin/gar and gmake.

5 July 2010: Wouter
	- log if a server is skipped because it is on the donotquery list,
	  at verbosity 4, to enable diagnosis why no queries to 127.0.0.1.
	- added feature to print configure date, target and options with -h.
	- added feature to print event backend system details with -h.
	- wdiff is not actually required by make test, updated requirements.

1 July 2010: Wouter
	- Fix RFC4035 compliance with 2.2 statement that the DNSKEY at apex
	  must be signed with all algorithms from the DS rrset at the parent.
	  This is now checked and becomes bogus if not.

28 June 2010: Wouter
	- Fix jostle list bug found by Vince (luoce@cnnic), it caused the qps
	  in overload situations to be about 5 qps for the class of shortly
	  serviced queries.
	  The capacity of the resolver is then about (numqueriesperthread / 2)
	  / (average time for such long queries) qps for long queries.
	  And about (numqueriesperthread / 2)/(jostletimeout in whole seconds)
	  qps for short queries, per thread.
	- Fix the max number of reply-address count to be applied for duplicate
	  queries, and not for new query list entries.  This raises the memory
	  usage to a max of (16+1)*numqueriesperthread reply addresses.

25 June 2010: Wouter
	- Fix handling of corner case reply from lame server, follows rfc2308.
	  It could lead to a nodata reply getting into the cache if the search
	  for a non-lame server turned up other misconfigured servers.
	- unbound.h has extern "C" statement for easier include in c++.

23 June 2010: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.
	- makedist upgraded cross compile openssl option, like this: 
	  ./makedist.sh -s -wssl openssl-1.0.0a.tar.gz -w --enable-gost

22 June 2010: Wouter
	- Unbound reports libev or libevent correctly in logs in verbose mode.
	- Fix to unload gost dynamic library module for leak testing.

18 June 2010: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.

17 June 2010: Wouter
	- Add AAAA to root hints for I.ROOT-SERVERS.NET.

16 June 2010: Wouter
	- Fix assertion failure reported by Kai Storbeck from XS4ALL, the
	  assertion was wrong.
	- updated ldns tarball.

15 June 2010: Wouter
	- tag 1.4.5 created.
	- trunk contains 1.4.6 in development.
	- Fix TCPreply on systems with no writev, if just 1 byte could be sent.
	- Fix to use one pointer less for iterator query state store_parent_NS.
	- makedist crosscompile to windows uses builtin ldns not host ldns.
	- Max referral count from 30 to 130, because 128 one character domains
	  is valid DNS.
	- added documentation for the histogram printout to syslog.

11 June 2010: Wouter
	- When retry to parent the retrycount is not wiped, so failed 
	  nameservers are not tried again.
	- iana portlist updated.

10 June 2010: Wouter
	- Fix bug where a long loop could be entered, now cycle detection
	  has a loop-counter and maximum search amount.

4 June 2010: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.
	- 1.4.5rc1 tag created.

3 June 2010: Wouter
	- ldns tarball updated, 1.6.5.
	- review comments, split dependency cycle tracking for parentside
	  last resort lookups for A and AAAA so there are more lookup options.

2 June 2010: Wouter
	- Fix compile warning if compiled without threads.
	- updated ldns-tarball with current ldns svn (pre 1.6.5).
	- GOST disabled-by-default, the algorithm number is allocated but the
	  RFC is still has to pass AUTH48 at the IETF.

1 June 2010: Wouter
	- Ignore Z flag in incoming messages too.
	- Fix storage of negative parent glue if that last resort fails.
	- libtoolize 2.2.6b, autoconf 2.65 applied to configure.
	- new splint flags for newer splint install.

31 May 2010: Wouter
	- Fix AD flag handling, it could in some cases mistakenly copy the AD 
	  flag from upstream servers.
	- alloc_special_obtain out of memory is not a fatal error any more,
	  enabling unbound to continue longer in out of memory conditions.
	- parentside names are dispreferred but not said to be dnssec-lame.
	- parentside check for cached newname glue.
	- fix parentside and querytargets modulestate, for dump_requestlist.
	- unbound-control-setup makes keys -rw-r--- so not all users permitted.
	- fix parentside from cache to be marked dispreferred for bad names.

28 May 2010: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.
	- parent-child disagreement approach altered.  Older fixes are
	  removed in place of a more exhaustive search for misconfigured data
	  available via the parent of a delegation.
	  This is designed to be throttled by cache entries, with TTL from the
	  parent if possible.  Additionally the loop-counter is used.
	  It also tests for NS RRset differences between parent and child.
	  The fetch of misconfigured data should be more reliable and thorough.
	  It should work reliably even with no or only partial data in cache.
	  Data received from the child (as always) is deemed more
	  authoritative than information received from the delegation parent.
	  The search for misconfigured data is not performed normally.

26 May 2010: Wouter
	- Contribution from Migiel de Vos (Surfnet): nagios patch for
	  unbound-host, in contrib/ (in the source tarball).  Makes
	  unbound-host suitable for monitoring dnssec(-chain) status.

21 May 2010: Wouter
	- EDNS timeout code will not fire if EDNS status already known.
	- EDNS failure not stored if EDNS status known to work.

19 May 2010: Wouter
	- Fix resolution for domains like safesvc.com.cn.  If the iterator
	  can not recurse further and it finds the delegation in a state
	  where it would otherwise have rejected it outhand if so received
	  from a cache lookup, then it can try to ask higherup (with loop
	  protection).
	- Fix comments in iter_utils:dp_is_useless.

18 May 2010: Wouter
	- Fix various compiler warnings from the clang llvm compiler.
	- iana portlist updated.

6 May 2010: Wouter
	- Fix bug#308: spelling error in variable name in parser and lexer.

4 May 2010: Wouter
	- Fix dnssec-missing detection that was turned off by server selection.
	- Conforms to draft-ietf-dnsop-default-local-zones-13.  Added default
	  reverse lookup blocks for IPv4 test nets 100.51.198.in-addr.arpa,
	  113.0.203.in-addr.arpa and Orchid prefix 0.1.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.

29 April 2010: Wouter
	- Fix for dnssec lameness detection to use the key cache.
	- infra cache entries that are expired are wiped clean.  Previously
	  it was possible to not expire host data (if accessed often).

28 April 2010: Wouter
	- ldns tarball updated and GOST support is detected and then enabled. 
	- iana portlist updated.
	- Fix detection of gost support in ldns (reported by Chris Smith).

27 April 2010: Wouter
	- unbound-control get_option domain-insecure shows config file items.
	- fix retry sequence if prime hints are recursion-lame.
	- autotrust anchor file can be initialized with a ZSK key as well.
	- harden-referral-path does not result in failures due to max-depth.
	  You can increase the max-depth by adding numbers (' 0') after the
	  target-fetch-policy, this increases the depth to which is checked.

26 April 2010: Wouter
	- Compile fix using Sun Studio 12 compiler on Solaris 5.9, use
	  CPPFLAGS during configure process.
	- if libev is installed on the base system (not libevent), detect
	  it from the event.h header file and link with -lev.
	- configlexer.lex gets config.h, and configyyrename.h added by make,
	  no more double include.
	- More strict scrubber (Thanks to George Barwood for the idea):
	  NS set must be pertinent to the query (qname subdomain nsname).
	- Fix bug#307: In 0x20 backoff fix fallback so the number of 
	  outstanding queries does not become -1 and block the request.
	  Fixed handling of recursion-lame in combination with 0x20 fallback.
	  Fix so RRsets are compared canonicalized and sorted if the immediate
	  comparison fails, this makes it work around round-robin sites.

23 April 2010: Wouter
	- Squelch log message: sendto failed permission denied for
	  255.255.255.255, it is visible in VERB_DETAIL (verbosity 2).
	- Fix to fetch data as last resort more tenaciously.  When cycle
	  targets cause the server selection to believe there are more options
	  when they really are not there, the server selection is reinitiated.
	- Fix fetch from blacklisted dnssec lame servers as last resort.  The
	  server's IP address is then given in validator errors as well.
	- Fix local-zone type redirect that did not use the query name for
	  the answer rrset.

22 April 2010: Wouter
	- tag 1.4.4.
	- trunk contains 1.4.5 in development.
	- Fix validation failure for qtype ANY caused by a RRSIG parse failure.
	  The validator error message was 'no signatures from ...'.

16 April 2010: Wouter
	- more portability defines for CMSG_SPACE, CMSG_ALIGN, CMSG_LEN.
	- tag 1.4.4rc1.

15 April 2010: Wouter
	- ECC-GOST algorithm number 12 that is assigned by IANA.  New test
	  example key and signatures for GOST.  GOST requires openssl-1.0.0.
	  GOST is still disabled by default.

9 April 2010: Wouter
	- Fix bug#305: pkt_dname_tolower could read beyond end of buffer or
	  get into an endless loop, if 0x20 was enabled, and buffers are small
	  or particular broken packets are received.
	- Fix chain of trust with CNAME at an intermediate step, for the DS
	  processing proof.

8 April 2010: Wouter
	- Fix validation of queries with wildcard names (*.example).

6 April 2010: Wouter
	- Fix EDNS probe for .de DNSSEC testbed failure, where the infra
	  cache timeout coincided with a server update, the current EDNS 
	  backoff is less sensitive, and does not cache the backoff unless 
	  the backoff actually works and the domain is not expecting DNSSEC.
	- GOST support with correct algorithm numbers.

1 April 2010: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.

24 March 2010: Wouter
	- unbound control flushed items are not counted when flushed again.

23 March 2010: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.

22 March 2010: Wouter
	- unbound-host disables use-syslog from config file so that the
	  config file for the main server can be used more easily.
	- fix bug#301: unbound-checkconf could not parse interface
	  '0.0.0.0@5353', even though unbound itself worked fine.

19 March 2010: Wouter
	- fix fwd_ancil test to pass if the socket options are not supported.

18 March 2010: Wouter
	- Fixed random numbers for port, interface and server selection.
	  Removed very small bias.
	- Refer to the listing in unbound-control man page in the extended
	  statistics entry in the unbound.conf man page.

16 March 2010: Wouter
	- Fix interface-automatic for OpenBSD: msg.controllen was too small,
	  also assertions on ancillary data buffer.
	- check for IP_SENDSRCADDR for interface-automatic or IP_PKTINFO.
	- for NSEC3 check if signatures are cached.

15 March 2010: Wouter
	- unit test for util/regional.c.

12 March 2010: Wouter
	- Reordered configure checks so fork and -lnsl -lsocket checks are
	  earlier, and thus later checks benefit from and do not hinder them.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- ldns tarball updated.
	- Fix python use when multithreaded.
	- Fix solaris python compile.
	- Include less in config.h and include per code file for ldns, ssl.

11 March 2010: Wouter
	- another memory allocation option: --enable-alloc-nonregional.
	  exposes the regional allocations to other memory purifiers.
	- fix for memory alignment in struct sock_list allocation.
	- Fix for MacPorts ldns without ssl default, unbound checks if ldns
	  has dnssec functionality and uses the builtin if not.
	- Fix daemonize on Solaris 10, it did not detach from terminal.
	- tag 1.4.3 created.
	- trunk is 1.4.4 in development.
	- spelling fix in validation error involving cnames.

10 March 2010: Wouter
	- --enable-alloc-lite works with test set.
	- portability in the testset: printf format conversions, prototypes.

9 March 2010: Wouter
	- tag 1.4.2 created.
	- trunk is 1.4.3 in development.
	- --enable-alloc-lite debug option.

8 March 2010: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.

4 March 2010: Wouter
	- Fix crash in control channel code.

3 March 2010: Wouter
	- better casts in pipe code, brackets placed wrongly.
	- iana portlist updated.

1 March 2010: Wouter
	- make install depends on make all.
	- Fix 5011 auto-trust-anchor-file initial read to skip RRSIGs.
	- --enable-checking: enables assertions but does not look nonproduction.
	- nicer VERB_DETAIL (verbosity 2, unbound-host -d) output, with
	  nxdomain and nodata distinguished.
	- ldns tarball updated.
	- --disable-rpath fixed for libtool not found errors.
	- new fedora specfile from Fedora13 in contrib from Paul Wouters.

26 February 2010: Wouter
	- Fixup prototype for lexer cleanup in daemon code.
	- unbound-control list_stubs, list_forwards, list_local_zones and
	  list_local_data.

24 February 2010: Wouter
	- Fix scrubber bug that potentially let NS records through.  Reported
	  by Amanda Constant.
	- Also delete potential poison references from additional.
	- Fix: no classification of a forwarder as lame, throw away instead.

23 February 2010: Wouter
	- libunbound ub_ctx_get_option() added.
	- unbound-control set_option and get_option commands.
	- iana portlist updated.

18 February 2010: Wouter
	- A little more strict DS scrubbing.
	- No more blacklisting of unresponsive servers, a 2 minute timeout
	  is backed off to.
	- RD flag not enabled for dnssec-blacklisted tries, unless necessary.
	- pickup ldns compile fix, libdl for libcrypto.
	- log 'tcp connect: connection timed out' only in high verbosity.
	- unbound-control log_reopen command.
	- moved get_option code from unbound-checkconf to util/config_file.c

17 February 2010: Wouter
	- Disregard DNSKEY from authority section for chain of trust.
	  DS records that are irrelevant to a referral scrubbed.  Anti-poison.
	- iana portlist updated.

16 February 2010: Wouter
	- Check for 'no space left on device' (or other errors) when 
	  writing updated autotrust anchors and print errno to log.

15 February 2010: Wouter
	- Fixed the requery protection, the TTL was 0, it is now 900 seconds,
	  hardcoded.  We made the choice to send out more conservatively,
	  protecting against an aggregate effect more than protecting a
	  single user (from their own folly, perhaps in case of misconfig).

12 February 2010: Wouter
	- Re-query pattern changed on validation failure.  To protect troubled
	  authority servers, unbound caches a failure for the DNSKEY or DS
	  records for the entire zone, and only retries that 900 seconds later.
	  This implies that only a handful of packets are sent extra to the
	  authority if the zone fails.

11 February 2010: Wouter
	- ldns tarball update for long label length syntax error fix.
	- iana portlist updated.

9 February 2010: Wouter
	- Fixup in compat snprintf routine, %f 1.02 and %g support.
	- include math.h for testbound test compile portability.

2 February 2010: Wouter
	- Updated url of IANA itar, interim trust anchor repository, in script.

1 February 2010: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.
	- configure test for memcmp portability.

27 January 2010: Wouter
	- removed warning on format string in validator error log statement.
	- iana portlist updated.

22 January 2010: Wouter
	- libtool finish the install of unbound python dynamic library.

21 January 2010: Wouter
	- acx_nlnetlabs.m4 synchronised with nsd's version.

20 January 2010: Wouter
	- Fixup lookup trouble for parent-child domains on the first query.

14 January 2010: Wouter
	- Fixup ldns detection to also check for header files.

13 January 2010: Wouter
	- prefetch-key option that performs DNSKEY queries earlier in the
	  validation process, and that could halve the latency on DNSSEC
	  queries.  It takes some extra processing (CPU, a cache is needed).

12 January 2010: Wouter
	- Fix unbound-checkconf for auto-trust-anchor-file present checks.

8 January 2010: Wouter
	- Fix for parent-child disagreement code which could have trouble
	  when (a) ipv6 was disabled and (b) the TTL for parent and child
	  were different.  There were two bugs, the parent-side information
	  is fixed to no longer block lookup of child side information and
	  the iterator is fixed to no longer attempt to get ipv6 when it is
	  not enabled and then give up in failure.
	- test and fixes to make prefetch actually store the answer in the
	  cache.  Considers some rrsets 'already expired' but does not allow
	  overwriting of rrsets considered more secure.

7 January 2010: Wouter
	- Fixup python documentation (thanks Leo Vandewoestijne).
	- Work on cache prefetch feature.
	- Stats for prefetch, in log print stats, unbound-control stats
	  and in unbound_munin plugin.

6 January 2010: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.
	- bug#291: DNS wireformat max is 255. dname_valid allowed 256 length.
	- verbose output includes parent-side-address notion for lameness.
	- documented val-log-level: 2 setting in example.conf and man page.
	- change unbound-control-setup from 1024(sha1) to 1536(sha256).

1 January 2010: Wouter

9 December 2009: Wouter
	- Fix Bug#287(reopened): update of ldns tarball with fix for parse
	  errors generated for domain names like '.example.com'.
	- Fix SOA excluded from negative DS responses.  Reported by Hauke
	  Lampe.  The negative cache did not include proper SOA records for
	  negative qtype DS responses which makes BIND barf on it, such
	  responses are now only used internally.
	- Fix negative cache lookup of closestencloser check of DS type bit.

8 December 2009: Wouter
	- Fix for lookup of parent-child disagreement domains, where the
	  parent-side glue works but it does not provide proper NS, A or AAAA
	  for itself, fixing domains such as motorcaravanners.eu.
	- Feature: you can specify a port number in the interface: line, so
	  you can bind the same interface multiple times at different ports.

7 December 2009: Wouter
	- Bug#287: Fix segfault when unbound-control remove nonexistent local
	  data.  Added check to tests.

	- Fixup major libtool version to 2 because of why_bogus change.
	  It was 1:5:0 but should have been 2:0:0.

23 November 2009: Wouter
	- Patch from David Hubbard for libunbound manual page.
	- Fixup endless spinning in unbound-control stats reported by
	  Attila Nagy.  Probably caused by clock reversal.

	- iana portlist updated.

8 October 2009: Wouter
	- please doxygen
	- add val-log-level print to corner case (nameserver.epost.bg).
	- more detail to errors from insecure delegation checks.
	- Fix double time subtraction in negative cache reported by 
	  Amanda Constant and Hugh Mahon.
	- Made new validator error string available from libunbound for
	  applications.  It is in result->why_bogus, a zero-terminated string.
	  unbound-host prints it by default if a result is bogus.
	  Also the errinf is public in module_qstate (for other modules).

7 October 2009: Wouter
	- retry for validation failure in DS and prime results. Less mem use.
	  unit test.  Provisioning in other tests for requeries.
	- retry for validation failure in DNSKEY in middle of chain of trust.
	  unit test.
	- retry for empty non terminals in chain of trust and unit test.
	- Fixed security bug where the signatures for NSEC3 records were not
	  checked when checking for absence of DS records.  This could have
	  enabled the substitution of an insecure delegation.
	- moved version number to 1.4.0 because of 1.3.4 release with only
	  the NSEC3 patch from the entry above.
	- val-log-level: 2 shows extended error information for validation
	  failures, but still one (longish) line per failure.  For example:
	  validation failure <example.com. DNSKEY IN>: signature expired from
	  192.0.2.4 for trust anchor example.com. while building chain of trust
	  validation failure <www.example.com. A IN>: no signatures from
	  192.0.2.6 for key example.com. while building chain of trust

6 October 2009: Wouter
	- Test set updated to provide additional ns lookup result.
	  The retry would attempt to fetch the data from other nameservers
	  for bogus data, and this needed to be provisioned in the tests.

5 October 2009: Wouter
	- first validation failure retry code.  Retries for data failures.
	  And unit test.

2 October 2009: Wouter

	  drop the occasional packet in spikes due to full socket buffers.
	  netstat -su keeps a counter of UDP dropped due to full buffers.
	- review of validator/autotrust.c, small fixes and comments.

23 September 2009: Wouter
	- 5011 query failed counts verification failures, not lookup failures.
	- 5011 probe failure handling fixup.
	- test unbound reading of original autotrust data.
	  The metadata per-key, such as key state (PENDING, MISSING, VALID) is
	  picked up, otherwise performs initial probe like usual.

22 September 2009: Wouter
	- autotrust test with algorithm rollover, new ordering of checks
	  assists in orderly rollover.
	- autotrust test with algorithm rollover to unknown algorithm.
	  checks if new keys are supported before adding them.
	- autotrust test with trust point revocation, becomes unsigned.
	- fix DNSSEC-missing-signature detection for minimal responses
	  for qtype DNSKEY (assumes DNSKEY occurs at zone apex).

	- increased MAXSYSLOGLEN so .bg key can be printed in debug output.
	- use linebuffering for log-file: output, this can be significantly
	  faster than the previous fflush method and enable some class of
	  resolvers to use high verbosity (for short periods).
	  Not on windows, because line buffering does not work there.

9 September 2009: Wouter
	- Fix bug where DNSSEC-bogus messages were marked with too high TTL.
	  The RRsets would still expire at the normal time, but this would
	  keep messages bogus in the cache for too long.
	- regression test for that bug.
	- documented that load_cache is meant for debugging.

8 September 2009: Wouter
	- fixup printing errors when load_cache, they were printed to the
	  SSL connection which broke, now to the log.
	- new ldns - with fixed parse of large SOA values.

7 September 2009: Wouter
	- autotrust testbound scenarios.
	- autotrust fix that failure count is written to file.
	- autotrust fix that keys may become valid after add holddown time
	  alone, before the probe returns.

4 September 2009: Wouter
	- Changes to make unbound work with libevent-2.0.3 alpha. (in
	  configure detection due to new ssl dependency in libevent)
	- do not call sphinx for documentation when python is disabled.
	- remove EV_PERSIST from libevent timeout code to make the code

	  to 16 queries in a row and the timeout gets above 2 minutes.
	- autotrust work, split up DS verification of DNSKEYs.

14 August 2009: Wouter
	- unbound-control lookup prints out infra cache information, like RTT.
	- Fix bug in DLV lookup reported by Amanda from Secure64.
	  It could sometimes wrongly classify a domain as unsigned, which
	  does not give the AD bit on replies.

13 August 2009: Wouter
	- autotrust read anchor files. locked trust anchors.

12 August 2009: Wouter
	- autotrust import work.

21 July 2009: Wouter
	- Fix server selection, so that it waits for open target queries when
	  faced with lameness.

	  in the wrong order would be parsed, but put wrongly into internal
	  structures so that later validation would fail.
	- Extreme lenience for wrongly truncated replies where a positive

17 June 2009: Wouter
	- CREDITS entry for cz.nic, sponsoring a 'summer of code' that was
	  used for the python code in unbound. (http://www.nic.cz/vip/ in cz).

16 June 2009: Wouter
	- Fixup opportunistic target query generation to it does not
	  generate queries that are known to fail.
	- Touchup on munin total memory report.
	- messages picked out of the cache by the iterator are checked

	- iana portlist updated.

14 June 2009: Wouter
	- Fixed bug where cached responses would lose their security

13 June 2009: Wouter
	- bug #254. removed random whitespace from example.conf.

12 June 2009: Wouter

	- If unfulfilled callbacks are deleted they are called with an error.
	- fptr wlist checks for mesh callbacks.
	- fwd above stub in configuration works.

11 June 2009: Wouter
	- Fix queries for type DS when forward or stub zones are there.
	  They are performed to higherup domains, and thus treated as if
	  going to higher zones when looking up the right forward or stub
	  server.  This makes a stub pointing to a local server that has
	  a local view of example.com signed with the same keys as are
	  publicly used work.  Reported by Johan Ihren.
	- Added build-unbound-localzone-from-hosts.pl to contrib, from
	  Dennis DeDonatis.  It converts /etc/hosts into config statements.
	- same thing fixed for forward-zone and DS, chain of trust from
	  public internet into the forward-zone works now.  Added unit test.

9 June 2009: Wouter
	- openssl key files are opened apache-style, when user is root and
	  before chrooting.  This makes permissions on remote-control key 
	  files easier to set up.  Fixes bug #251.
	- flush_type and flush_name remove msg cache entries.
	- codereview - dp copy bogus setting fix.

8 June 2009: Wouter

	- fixup bad free() when wrongly encoded DSA signature is seen.
	  Reported by Paul Wouters.
	- review comments from Matthijs.

2 June 2009: Wouter
	- --enable-sha2 option. The draft rsasha256 changed its algorithm
	  numbers too often.  Therefore it is more prudent to disable the
	  RSASHA256 and RSASHA512 support by default.
	- ldns trunk included as new tarball.
	- recreated the 1.3.0 tag in svn. rc1 tarball generated at this point.

29 May 2009: Wouter
	- fixup doc bug in README reported by Matthew Dempsky.

28 May 2009: Wouter
	- update iana port list
	- update ldns lib tarball

27 May 2009: Wouter
	- detect lack of IPv6 support on XP (with a different error code).
	- Fixup a crash-on-exit which was triggered by a very long queue.
	  Unbound would try to re-use ports that came free, but this is
	  of course not really possible because everything is deleted.
	  Most easily triggered on XP (not Vista), maybe because of the
	  network stack encouraging large messages backlogs.
	- change in debug statements.
	- Fixed bug that could cause a crash if root prime failed when there
	  were message backlogs.

26 May 2009: Wouter
	- Thanks again to Brett Carr, found an assertion that was not true.
	  Assertion checked if recursion parent query still existed.

29 April 2009: Wouter
	- Thanks to Brett Carr, caught windows resource leak, use 
	  closesocket() and not close() on sockets or else the network stack
	  starts to leak handles.
	- Removed usage of windows Mutex because windows cannot handle enough
	  mutexes open.  Provide own mutex implementation using primitives.

16 April 2009: Wouter
	- winsock event handler exit very quickly on signal, even if
	  under heavy load.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- fixup windows winsock handler reentrant problem.

14 April 2009: Wouter
	- bug #245: fix munin plugin, perform cleanup of stale lockfiles.
	- makedist.sh; better help text.

	- clock skew checks in unbound, config statements.
	- nxdomain ttl considerations in requirements.txt

3 April 2009: Wouter

	  targets have been more vulnerable to the TTL miscalculation bug. 
	- documentation test fixed for python addition.

2 April 2009: Wouter
	- pyunbound (libunbound python plugin) compiles using libtool.
	- documentation for pythonmod and pyunbound is generated in doc/html.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- fixed bug in unbound-control flush_zone where it would not flush
	  every message in the target domain.  This especially impacted 
	  NXDOMAIN messages which could remain in the cache regardless.
	- python module test package.

1 April 2009: Wouter
	- suppress errors when trying to contact authority servers that gave
	  ipv6 AAAA records for their nameservers with ipv4 mapped contents.

18 March 2009: Wouter
	- Added tests, unknown algorithms become insecure. fallback works.
	- Fix for and test for unknown algorithms in a trust anchor
	  definition.  Trust anchors with no supported algos are ignored.
	  This means a (higher)DS or DLV entry for them could succeed, and
	  otherwise they are treated as insecure.
	- domain-insecure: "example.com" statement added. Sets domain
	  insecure regardless of chain of trust DSs or DLVs. The inverse
	  of a trust-anchor.

17 March 2009: Wouter
	- unit test for unsupported algorithm in anchor warning.
	- fixed so queries do not fail on opportunistic target queries.

16 March 2009: Wouter
	- fixup diff error printout in contrib/update-itar.sh.

	- service works on xp/vista, no config necessary (using defaults).
	- windows registry settings.

2 March 2009: Wouter
	- fixup --export-symbols to be -export-symbls for libtool.

19 February 2009: Wouter
	- unbound-checkconf and unbound print warnings when trust anchors
	  have unsupported algorithms.
	- added contrib/update-itar.sh  This script is similar to
	  update-anchor.sh, and updates from the IANA ITAR repository.
	  You can provide your own PGP key and trust repo, or can use the
	  builtin.  The program uses wget and gpg to work.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- update-itar.sh: using ftp:// urls because https godaddy certificate
	  is not available everywhere and then gives fatal errors.  The 
	  security is provided by pgp signature.

18 February 2009: Wouter
	- more cycle detection. Also for target queries.
	- fixup bug where during deletion of the mesh queries the callbacks
	  that were reentrant caused assertion failures. Keep the mesh in 
	  a reentrant safe state.  Affects libunbound, reload of server,
	  on quit and flush_requestlist.
	- iana portlist updated.

13 February 2009: Wouter
	- forwarder information now per-thread duplicated.
	  This keeps it read only for speed, with no locking necessary.
	- forward command for unbound control to change forwarders to use
	  on the fly.
	- document that unbound-host reads no config file by default.
	- updated iana portlist.

	- fixup EOL in include directive (reported by Paul Wouters).
	  You can no longer specify newlines in the names of included files.
	- config parser changed. Gives some syntax errors closer to where they 
	  occurred. Does not enforce a space after keyword anymore.
	  Does not allow literal newlines inside quoted strings anymore.
	- verbosity level 5 logs customer IP for new requestlist entries.
	- test fix, lexer and cancel test.
	- new option log-time-ascii: yes  if you enable it prints timestamps
	  in the log file as Feb 06 13:45:26 (like syslog does).
	- detect event_base_new in libevent-1.4.1 and later and use it.
	- #231 unbound-checkconf -o option prints that value from config file.
	  Useful for scripting in management scripts and the like.

5 February 2009: Wouter
	- ldns 1.5.0 rc as tarball included.
	- 1.3.0 development continues:
	  change in libunbound API: ub_cancel can return an error, that
	  the async_id did not exist, or that it was already delivered.
	  The result could have been delivered just before the cancel 
	  routine managed to acquire the lock, so a caller may get the
	  result at the same time they call cancel.  For this case, 
	  ub_cancel tries to return an error code.
	  Fixes race condition in ub_cancel() libunbound function.
	- MacOSX Leopard cleaner text output from configure.
	- initgroups(3) is called to drop secondary group permissions, if
	  applicable.
	- configure option --with-ldns-builtin forces the use of the 
	  inluded ldns package with the unbound source.  The -I include
	  is put before the others, so it avoids bad include files from
	  an older ldns install.
	- daemon(3) posix call is used when available.
	- testbound test for older fix added.

4 February 2009: Wouter
	- tag for release 1.2.1.
	- trunk setup for 1.3.0 development.

3 February 2009: Wouter
	- noted feature requests in doc/TODO.
	- printout more detailed errors on ssl certificate loading failures.
	- updated IANA portlist.

16 January 2009: Wouter
	- more quiet about ipv6 network failures, i.e. when ipv6 is not
	  available (network unreachable). Debug still printed on high
	  verbosity.
	- unbound-host -4 and -6 options. Stops annoying ipv6 errors when
	  debugging with unbound-host -4 -d ... 
	- more cycle detection for NS-check, addr-check, root-prime and
	  stub-prime queries in the iterator.  Avoids possible deadlock
	  when priming fails.

15 January 2009: Wouter
	- bug #229: fixup configure checks for compilation with Solaris 
	  Sun cc compiler, ./configure CC=/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc
	- fixup suncc warnings.
	- fix bug where unbound could crash using libevent 1.3 and older.
	- update testset for recent retry change.

14 January 2009: Wouter
	- 1.2.1 feature: negative caching for failed queries.
	  Queries that failed are cached for 5 seconds (NORR_TTL).
	  If the failure is local, like out of memory, it is not cached.
	- the TTL comparison for the cache used different comparisons,
	  causing many cache responses that used the iterator and validator
	  state machines unnecessarily.
	- retry from 4 to 5 so that EDNS drop retry is part of the first
	  query resolve attempt, and cached error does not stop EDNS fallback.
	- remove debug prints that protect against bad referrals.
	- honor QUIET=no on make commandline (or QUIET=yes ).

13 January 2009: Wouter
	- fixed bug in lameness marking, removed printouts.
	- find NS rrset more cleanly for qtype NS.
	- Moved changes to 1.2.0 for release. Thanks to Mark Zealey for
	  reporting and logs.
	- 1.2.1 feature: stops resolving AAAAs promiscuously when they
	  are in the negative cache.

12 January 2009: Wouter
	- fixed bug in infrastructure lameness cache, did not lowercase
	  name of zone to hash when setting lame.

	  statements. (Adapted from patch by Paul Wouters).
	- typo fix and iana portlist updated.
	- porting testsuite; unused var warning, and type fixup.

6 January 2009: Wouter
	- fixup packet-of-death when compiled with --enable-debug.
	  A malformed packet could cause an internal assertion failure.
	- added test for HINFO canonicalisation behaviour.
	- fixup reported problem with transparent local-zone data where
	  queries with different type could get nxdomain. Now queries
	  with a different name get resolved normally, with different type
	  get a correct NOERROR/NODATA answer.
	- HINFO no longer downcased for validation, making unbound compatible
	  with bind and ldns.
	- fix reading included config files when chrooted.
	  Give full path names for include files.
	  Relative path names work if the start dir equals the working dir.
	- fix libunbound message transport when no packet buffer is available.

5 January 2009: Wouter
	- fixup getaddrinfo failure handling for remote control port.
	- added L.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. AAAA 2001:500:3::42 to builtin root hints.
	- fixup so it works with libev-3.51 from http://dist.schmorp.de/libev/
	- comm_timer_set performs base_set operation after event_add.

18 December 2008: Wouter
	- fixed bug reported by Duane Wessels: error in DLV lookup, would make
	  some zones that had correct DLV keys as insecure.
	- follows -rc makedist from ldns changes (no _rc).
	- ldns tarball updated with 1.4.1rc for DLV unit test.
	- verbose prints about recursion lame detection and server selection.
	- fixup BSD port for infra host storage. It hashed wrongly.
	- fixup makedist snapshot name generation.
	- do not reopen syslog to avoid dev/log dependency.

17 December 2008: Wouter
	- follows ldns makedist.sh. -rc option. autom4te dir removed.
	- unbound-control status command.
	- extended statistics has a number of ipv6 queries counter.
	  contrib/unbound_munin_ was updated to draw ipv6 in the hits graph.

16 December 2008: Wouter
	- follow makedist improvements from ldns, for maintainers prereleases.
	- snapshot version uses _ not - to help rpm distinguish the
	  version number.

11 December 2008: Wouter
	- better fix for bug #219: use LOG_NDELAY with openlog() call.
	  Thanks to Tamas Tevesz.

9 December 2008: Wouter
	- bug #221 fixed: unbound checkconf checks if key files exist if
	  remote control is enabled. Also fixed NULL printf when not chrooted.
	- iana portlist updated.

3 December 2008: Wouter
	- Fix problem reported by Jaco Engelbrecht where unbound-control stats
	  freezes up unbound if this was compiled without threading, and
	  was using multiple processes.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- test for remote control with interprocess communication.
	- created command distribution mechanism so that remote control
	  commands other than 'stats' work on all processes in a nonthreaded
	  compiled version. dump/load cache work, on the first process.
	- fixup remote control local_data addition memory corruption bug.

1 December 2008: Wouter
	- SElinux policy files in contrib/selinux for the unbound daemon,
	  by Paul Wouters and Adam Tkac.

25 November 2008: Wouter
	- configure complains when --without-ssl is given (bug #220).
	- skip unsupported feature tests on vista/mingw.
	- fixup testcode/streamtcp to work on vista/mingw.
	- root-hints test checks version of dig required.
	- blacklisted servers are polled at a low rate (1%) to see if they
	  come back up. But not if there is some other working server.

24 November 2008: Wouter
	- document that the user of the server daemon needs read privileges
	  on the keys and certificates generated by unbound-control-setup.
	  This is different per system or distribution, usually, running the
	  script under the same username as the server uses suffices.
	  i.e.  sudo -u unbound unbound-control-setup
	- testset port to vista/mingw.
	- tcp_sigpipe to freebsd port.

21 November 2008: Wouter
	- fixed tcp accept, errors were printed when they should not.
	- unbound-control-setup.sh removes read/write permissions other
	  from the keys it creates (as suggested by Dmitriy Demidov).

20 November 2008: Wouter
	- fixup fatal error due to faulty error checking after tcp accept.
	- add check in rlimit to avoid integer underflow.
	- rlimit check with new formula; better estimate for number interfaces
	- nicer comments in rlimit check.
	- tag 1.1.1 created in svn.
	- trunk label is 1.1.2

19 November 2008: Wouter
	- bug #219: fixed so that syslog which delays opening until the first
	  log line is written, gets a log line while not chroot'ed yet.

18 November 2008: Wouter
	- iana portlist updated.
	- removed cast in unit test debug print that was not 64bit safe.
	- trunk back to 1.1.0; copied to tags 1.1.0 release.
	- trunk to has version number 1.1.1 again.
	- in 1.1.1; make clean nicer. grammar in manpage.

17 November 2008: Wouter
	- theoretical fix for problems reported on mailing list.
	  If a delegation point has no A but only AAAA and do-ip6 is no,
	  resolution would fail. Fixed to ask for the A and AAAA records.
	  It has to ask for both always, so that it can fail quietly, from
	  TLD perspective, when a zone is only reachable on one transport.
	- test for above, only AAAA and doip6 is no. Fix causes A record
	  for nameserver to be fetched.
	- fixup address duplication on cache fillup for delegation points.
	- testset updated for new query answer requirements.

14 November 2008: Wouter
	- created 1.1.0 release tag in svn.
	- trunk moved to 1.1.1

	- silenced EHOSTDOWN (verbosity 2 or higher to see it).
	- review comments from Jelte, Matthijs. Neater code.

12 November 2008: Wouter
	- add unbound-control manpage to makedist replace list.

11 November 2008: Wouter
	- unit test for negative cache, stress tests the refcounting.
	- fix for refcounting error that could cause fptr_wlist fatal exit
	  in the negative cache rbtree (upcoming 1.1 feature). (Thanks to 
	  Attila Nagy for testing).
	- nicer comments in cachedump about failed RR to string conversion.
	- fix 32bit wrap around when printing large (4G and more) mem usage
	  for extended statistics.

10 November 2008: Wouter
	- fixup the getaddrinfo compat code rename.

8 November 2008: Wouter
	- added configure check for eee build warning.

6 November 2008: Wouter
	- dname_priv must decompress the name before comparison.
	- iana portlist updated.

5 November 2008: Wouter
	- fixed possible memory leak in key_entry_key deletion.
	  Would leak a couple bytes when trust anchors were replaced.
	- if query and reply qname overlap, the bytes are skipped not copied.
	- fixed file descriptor leak when messages were jostled out that
	  had outstanding (TCP) replies.
	- DNAMEs used from cache have their synthesized CNAMEs initialized
	  properly.
	- fixed file descriptor leak for localzone type deny (for TCP).
	- fixed memleak at exit for nsec3 negative cached zones.
	- fixed memleak for the keyword 'nodefault' when reading config.
	- made verbosity of 'edns incapable peer' warning higher, so you
	  do not get spammed by it.
	- caught elusive Bad file descriptor error bug, that would print the
	  error while unnecessarily try to listen to a closed fd. Fixed.

4 November 2008: Wouter
	- fixed -Wwrite-strings warnings that result in better code.

3 November 2008: Wouter
	- fixup build process for Mac OSX linker, use ldns b32 compat funcs.
	- generated configure with autoconf-2.61.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- detect if libssl needs libdl.  For static linking with libssl.
	- changed to use new algorithm identifiers for sha256/sha512
	  from ldns 1.4.0 (need very latest version).
	- updated the included ldns tarball.
	- proper detection of SHA256 and SHA512 functions (not just sizes).

23 October 2008: Wouter
	- a little more debug info for failure on signer names. prints names.

22 October 2008: Wouter
	- CFLAGS are picked up by configure from the environment.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- updated ldns to use 1.4.0-pre20081022 so it picks up CFLAGS too.
	- new stub-prime: yesno option. Default is off, so it does not prime.
	  can be turned on to get same behaviour as previous unbound release.
	- made automated test that checks if builtin root hints are uptodate.
	- finished draft-wijngaards-dnsext-resolver-side-mitigation
	  implementation. The unwanted-reply-threshold can be set.
	- fixup so fptr_whitelist test in alloc.c works.

21 October 2008: Wouter
	- fix update-anchors.sh, so it does not report different RR order
	  as an update.  Sorts the keys in the file.  Updated copyright.
	- fixup testbound on windows, the command control pipe doesn't exist.
	- skip 08hostlib test on windows, no fork() available.
	- made unbound-remote work on windows.

20 October 2008: Wouter
	- quench a log message that is debug only.
	- iana portlist updated.
	- do not query bogus nameservers.  It is like nameservers that have 
	  the NS or A or AAAA record bogus are listed as donotquery.
	- if server selection is faced with only bad choices, it will
	  attempt to get more options to be fetched.
	- changed bogus-ttl default value from 900 to 60 seconds.
	  In anticipation that operator caused failures are more likely than
	  actual attacks at this time.  And thus repeated validation helps
	  the operators get the problem fixed sooner.  It makes validation
	  failures go away sooner (60 seconds after the zone is fixed).
	  Also it is likely to try different nameserver targets every minute,
	  so that if a zone is bad on one server but not another, it is 
	  likely to pick up the 'correct' one after a couple minutes,
	  and if the TTL is big enough that solves validation for the zone.
	- fixup unbound-control compilation on windows.

17 October 2008: Wouter
	- port Leopard/G5: fixup type conversion size_t/uint32.
	  please ranlib, stop file without symbols warning.
	- harden referral path now also validates the root after priming.
	  It looks up the root NS authoritatively as well as the root servers
	  and attemps to validate the entries.

16 October 2008: Wouter
	- Fixup negative TTL values appearing (reported by Attila Nagy).

15 October 2008: Wouter
	- better documentation for 0x20; remove fallback TODO, it is done.
	- harden-referral-path feature includes A, AAAA queries for glue,
	  as well as very careful NS caching (only when doing NS query).
	  A, AAAA use the delegation from the NS-query.

14 October 2008: Wouter
	- fwd_three.tpkg test was flaky.  If the three requests hit the
	  wrong threads by chance (or bad OS) then the test would fail.
	  Made less flaky by increasing number of retries.
	- stub_udp.tpkg changed to work, give root hints. fixed ldns_dname_abs.
	- ldns tarball is snapshot of ldns r2759 (1.4.0-pre-20081014).
	  Which includes the ldns_dname_absolute fix.
	- fwd_three test remains flaky now that unbound does not stop
	  listening when full.  Thus, removed timeout problem.
	  It may be serviced by three threads, or maybe by one.
	  Mostly only useful for lock-check testing now.

13 October 2008: Wouter
	- fixed recursion servers deployed as authoritative detection, so
	  that as a last resort, a +RD query is sent there to get the 
	  correct answer.
	- iana port list update.
	- ldns tarball is snapshot of ldns r2759 (1.4.0-pre-20081013).

10 October 2008: Wouter
	- fixup tests - the negative cache contained the correct NSEC3s for
	  two tests that are supposed to fail to validate.

9 October 2008: Wouter
	- negative cache caps max iterations of NSEC3 done.
	- NSEC3 negative cache for qtype DS works.

2 October 2008: Wouter
	- fixup unlink of pidfile.
	- fixup SHA256 algorithm collation code.
	- contrib/update-anchor.sh does not overwrite anchors if not needed.

	  so,  update-anchor.sh -d mydir && /etc/rc.d/unbound restart
	  can restart unbound exactly when needed.

30 September 2008: Wouter
	- fixup SHA256 DS downgrade, no longer possible to downgrade to SHA1.
	- tests for sha256 support and downgrade resistance.
	- RSASHA256 and RSASHA512 support (using the draft in dnsext),
	  using the drafted protocol numbers.
	- when using stub on localhost (127.0.0.1@10053) unbound works.
	  Like when running NSD to host a local zone, on the same machine.
	  The noprime feature. manpages more explanation. Added a test for it.
	- shorthand for reverse PTR,  local-data-ptr: "1.2.3.4 www.ex.com"

29 September 2008: Wouter
	- EDNS lameness detection, if EDNS packets are dropped this is
	  detected, eventually.

	- two tests for it and fixups of tests for nonrec refused.

29 August 2008: Wouter
	- version 1.1 number in trunk.
	- harden-referral-path option for query for NS records.
	  Default turns off expensive, experimental option.

28 August 2008: Wouter
	- fixup logfile handling; it is created with correct permissions
	  again. (from bugfix#199).
	  Some errors are not written to logfile (pidfile writing, forking),
	  and these are only visible by using the -d commandline flag.

27 August 2008: Wouter
	- daemon(3) is causing problems for people. Reverting the patch.
	  bug#200, and 199 and 203 contain sideline discussion on it.

12 August 2008: Wouter
	- finished adjusting testset to provide qtype NS answers.

11 August 2008: Wouter
	- Fixup rrset security updates overwriting 2181 trust status.
	  This makes validated to be insecure data just as worthless as
	  nonvalidated data, and 2181 rules prevent cache overwrites to them.
	- Fix assertion fail on bogus key handling.
	- dnssec lameness detection works on first query at trust apex.
	- NS queries get proper cache and dnssec lameness treatment.
	- fixup compilation without pthreads on linux.

	- fixup minitpkg to cleanup on windows with its file locking troubles.
	- minitpkg shows skipped tests in report.
	- skip ipv6 tests on ipv4 only hosts (requires only ipv6 localhost not
	  ipv6 connectivity).
	- winsock event handler keeps track of sticky TCP events, that have
	  not been fully handled yet. when interest in the event(s) resumes,
	  they are sent again. When WOULDBLOCK is returned events are cleared.
	- skip tests that need signals when testing on mingw.

18 June 2008: Wouter
	- open testbound replay files in binary mode, because fseek/ftell
	  do not work in ascii-mode on windows. The b does nothing on unix.
	  unittest and testbound tests work on windows (xp too).
	- ioctlsocket prints nicer error message.
	- fixed up some TCP porting for winsock.
	- lack of IPv6 gives a warning, no fatal error.
	- use WSAGetLastError() on windows instead of errno for some errors.

17 June 2008: Wouter
	- outgoing num fds 32 by default on windows ; it supports less
	  fds for waiting on than unixes.
	- winsock_event minievent handler for windows. (you could also
	  attempt to link with libevent/libev ports for windows).

	- fixup warnings compiling on eeepc xandros linux.

9 June 2008: Wouter
	- in iteration response type code
	  * first check for SOA record (negative answer) before NS record
	    and lameness.
	  * check if no AA bit for non-forwarder, and thus lame zone.
	    In response to error report by Richard Doty for mail.opusnet.com.
	- fixup unput warning from lexer on freeBSD.
	- bug#183. pidfile, rundir, and chroot configure options. Also the
	  example.conf and manual pages get the configured defaults.
	  You can use: (or accept the defaults to /usr/local/etc/unbound/)
	  --with-conf-file=filename
	  --with-pidfile=filename
	  --with-run-dir=path
	  --with-chroot-dir=path

	- Jelte fixed bugs in my absence
	  - bug 178: fixed unportable shell usage in configure (relied on 
	    bash shell).
	  - bug 180: fixed buffer overflow in unbound-checkconf use of strncat.
	  - bug 181: fixed buffer overflow in ldns (called by unbound to parse
	    config file parts).
	- fixes by Wouter
	  - bug 177: fixed compilation failure on opensuse, the 
	    --disable-static configure flag caused problems.  (Patch from 
	    Klaus Singvogel)
	  - bug 179: same fix as 177.
	  - bug 185: --disable-shared not passed along to ldns included with 
	    unbound. Fixed so that configure parameters are passed to the
	    subdir configure script.
	    fixed that ./libtool is used always, you can still override
	    manually with ./configure libtool=mylibtool or set $libtool in
	    the environment.
	- update of the ldns tarball to current ldns svn version (fix 181).
	- bug 184: -r option for unbound-host, read resolv.conf for 
	  forwarder. (Note that forwarder must support DNSSEC for validation
	  to succeed).

	- tpkg tests for udp wait list.
	- documented 0x20 status.

	- configure can detect libev(from its build directory) when passed
	  --with-libevent=/home/wouter/libev-3.2
	  libev-3.2 is a little faster than libevent-1.4.3-stable (about 5%).
	- unused commpoints not listed in epoll list.
	- statistics-cumulative option so that the values are not reset.
	- config creates array of available ports, 61841 available,
	  it excludes <1024 and iana assigned numbers.
	  config statements to modify the available port numbers.

8 April 2008: Wouter
	- unbound tries to set the ulimit fds when started as server.
	  if that does not work, it will scale back its requirements.

27 March 2008: Wouter
	- documented /dev/random symlink from chrootdir as FAQ entry.

26 March 2008: Wouter
	- implemented AD bit signaling. If a query sets AD bit (but not DO)
	  then the AD bit is set in the reply if the answer validated.
	  Without including DNSSEC signatures. Useful if you have a trusted
	  path from the client to the resolver. Follows dnssec-updates draft.

25 March 2008: Wouter
	- implemented check that for NXDOMAIN and NOERROR answers a query
	  section must be present in the reply (by the scrubber). And it must
	  be equal to the question sent, at least lowercase folded.
	  Previously this feature happened because the cache code refused
	  to store such messages. However blocking by the scrubber makes 
	  sure nothing gets into the RRset cache. Also, this looks like a
	  timeout (instead of an allocation failure) and this retries are
	  done (which is useful in a spoofing situation).
	- RTT banding. Band size 400 msec, this makes band around zero (fast)
	  include unknown servers. This makes unbound explore unknown servers.

7 March 2008: Wouter
	- -C config feature for harvest program. 
	- harvest handles CNAMEs too.

5 March 2008: Wouter
	- patch from Hugo Koji Kobayashi for iterator logs spelling.

4 March 2008: Wouter
	- From report by Jinmei Tatuya, rfc2181 trust value for remainder
	  of a cname trust chain is lower; not full answer_AA. 
	- test for this fix.
	- default config file location is /usr/local/etc/unbound.
	  Thus prefix is used to determine the location. This is also the
	  chroot and pidfile default location.

3 March 2008: Wouter
	- Create 0.10 svn tag.
	- 0.11 version in trunk.
	- indentation nicer.

	- option to use caps for id randomness.
	- config file option use-caps-for-id: yes
	- harvest debug tool

26 February 2008: Wouter
	- delay utility delays TCP as well. If the server that is forwarded 
	  to has a TCP error, the delay utility closes the connection.
	- delay does REUSE_ADDR, and can handle a server that closes its end.
	- answers use casing from query.

25 February 2008: Wouter
	- delay utility works. Gets decent thoughput too (>20000).

22 February 2008: Wouter
	- +2% for recursions, if identical queries (except for destination
	  and query ID) in the reply list, avoid re-encoding the answer.
	- removed TODO items for optimizations that do not show up in
	  profile reports.
	- default is now minievent - not libevent. As its faster and
	  not needed for regular installs, only for very large port ranges.
	- loop check different speedup pkt-dname-reading, 1% faster for
	  nocache-recursion check.
	- less hashing during msg parse, 4% for recursion.
	- small speed fix for dname_count_size_labels, +1 or +2% recursion.
	- some speed results noted:
	  optimization resulted in +40% for recursion (cache miss) and
	  +70 to +80 for cache hits, and +96% for version.bind.
	  zone nsec3 example, 100 NXDOMAIN queries, NSD 35182.8 Ub 36048.4
	  www.nlnetlabs.nl from cache: BIND 8987.99 Ub 31218.3
	  www with DO bit set : BIND 8269.31 Ub 28735.6 qps.
	  So, unbound can be about equal qps to NSD in cache hits.
	  And about 3.4x faster than BIND in cache performance.
	- delay utility for testing.

21 February 2008: Wouter
	- speedup of root-delegation message encoding by 15%.
	- minor speedup of compress tree_lookup, maybe 1%.
	- speedup of dname_lab_cmp and memlowercmp - the top functions in 
	  profiler output, maybe a couple percent when it matters.

20 February 2008: Wouter
	- setup speec_cache for need-ldns-testns in dotests.
	- check number of queued replies on incoming queries to avoid overload
	  on that account.
	- fptr whitelist checks are not disabled in optimize mode.
	- do-daemonize config file option.
	- minievent time share initializes time at start.
	- updated testdata for nsec3 new algorithm numbers (6, 7).
	- small performance test of packet encoding (root delegation).

19 February 2008: Wouter
	- applied patch to unbound-host man page from Jan-Piet Mens.
	- fix donotquery-localhost: yes default (it erroneously was switched
	  to default 'no').
	- time is only gotten once and the value is shared across unbound.
	- unittest cleans up crypto, so that it has no memory leaks.
	- mini_event shares the time value with unbound this results in 
	  +3% speed for cache responses and +9% for recursions.
	- ldns tarball update with new NSEC3 sign code numbers.
	- perform several reads per UDP operation. This improves performance
	  in DoS conditions, and costs very little in normal conditions.
	  improves cache response +50%, and recursions +10%.
	- modified asynclook test. because the callback from async is not
	  in any sort of lock (and thus can use all library functions freely),
	  this causes a tiny race condition window when the last lock is 
	  released for a callback and a new cancel() for that callback.
	  The only way to remove this is by putting callbacks into some 
	  lock window. I'd rather have the small possibility of a callback
	  for a cancelled function then no use of library functions in 
	  callbacks. Could be possible to only outlaw process(), wait(),
	  cancel() from callbacks, by adding another lock, but I'd rather not.

18 February 2008: Wouter
	- patch to unbound-host from Jan-Piet Mens.
	- unbound host prints errors if fails to configure context.
	- fixup perf to resend faster, so that long waiting requests do
	  not hold up the queue, they become lost packets or SERVFAILs,
	  or can be sent a little while later (i.e. processing time may 
	  take long, but throughput has to be high).
	- fixup iterator operating in no cache conditions (RD flag unset
	  after a CNAME).
	- streamlined code for RD flag setting.
	- profiled code and changed dname compares to be faster. 
	  The speedup is about +3% to +8% (depending on the test).
	- minievent tests for eintr and eagain.

15 February 2008: Wouter
	- added FreeBSD rc.d script to contrib.
	- --prefix option for configure also changes directory: pidfile:
	  and chroot: defaults in config file.
	- added cache speed test, for cache size OK and cache too small.

14 February 2008: Wouter
	- start without a config file (will complain, but start with
	  defaults).
	- perf test program works.

13 February 2008: Wouter
	- 0.9 released.
	- 1.0 development. Printout ldns version on unbound -h.
	- start of perf tool.
	- bugfix to read empty lines from /etc/hosts.

12 February 2008: Wouter
	- fixup problem with configure calling itself if ldns-src tarball
	  is not present.

11 February 2008: Wouter
	- changed library to use ub_ instead of ub_val_ as prefix.
	- statistics output text nice.
	- etc/hosts handling.
	- library function to put logging to a stream.
	- set any option interface.

	- fixup misclassification of root referral with NS in answer
	  when validating a nonrec query.
	- tag 0.9
	- layout of manpages, spelling fix in header, manpages process by
	  makedist, list asynclook and tcpstream tests as ldns-testns
	  required.

7 February 2008: Wouter
	- moved up all current level 2 to be level 3. And 3 to 4.
	  to make room for new debug level 2 for detailed information 
	  for operators.
	- verbosity level 2. Describes recursion and validation.
	- cleaner configure script and fixes for libevent solaris.
	- signedness for log output memory sizes in high verbosity.

6 February 2008: Wouter
	- clearer explanation of threading configure options.
	- fixup asynclook test for nothreading (it creates only one process
	  to do the extended test).
	- changed name of ub_val_result_free to ub_val_resolve_free.
	- removes warning message during library linking, renamed
	  libunbound/unbound.c -> libunbound.c and worker to libworker.
	- fallback without EDNS if result is NOTIMPL as well as on FORMERR.

5 February 2008: Wouter
	- statistics-interval: seconds option added.
	- test for statistics option
	- ignore errors making directories, these can occur in parallel builds
	- fixup Makefile strip command and libunbound docs typo.

31 January 2008: Wouter
	- bg thread/process reads and writes the pipe nonblocking all the time
	  so that even if the pipe is buffered or so, the bg thread does not
	  block, and services both pipes and queries.

30 January 2008: Wouter
	- check trailing / on chrootdir in checkconf.
	- check if root hints and anchor files are in chrootdir.
	- no route to host tcp error is verbosity level 2. 
	- removed unused send_reply_iov. and its configure check.
	- added prints of 'remote address is 1.2.3.4 port 53' to errors
	  from netevent; the basic socket errors.

28 January 2008: Wouter
	- fixup uninit use of buffer by libunbound (query id, flags) for
	  local_zone answers.
	- fixup uninit warning from random.c; also seems to fix sporadic
	  sigFPE coming out of openssl.
	- made openssl entropy warning more silent for library use. Needs
	  verbosity 1 now.
	- fixup forgotten locks for rbtree_searches on ctx->query tree.
	- random generator cleanup - RND_STATE_SIZE removed, and instead
	  a super-rnd can be passed at init to chain init random states.
	- test also does lock checks if available.
	- protect config access in libworker_setup().
	- libevent doesn't like comm_base_exit outside of runloop.
	- close fds after removing commpoints only (for epoll, kqueue).

25 January 2008: Wouter
	- added tpkg for asynclook and library use. 
	- allows localhost to be queried when as a library.
	- fixup race condition between cancel and answer (in case of
	  really fast answers that beat the cancel).
	- please doxygen, put doxygen comment in one place.
	- asynclook -b blocking mode and test.
	- refactor asynclook, nicer code.
	- fixup race problems from opensll in rand init from library, with
	  a mutex around the rand init.
	- fix pass async_id=NULL to _async resolve().
	- rewrote _wait() routine, so that it is threadsafe.
	- cancelation is threadsafe.
	- asynclook extended test in tpkg.
	- fixed two races where forked bg process waits for (somehow shared?)
	  locks, so does not service the query pipe on the bg side.
	  Now those locks are only held for fg_threads and for bg_as_a_thread.

24 January 2008: Wouter
	- tested the cancel() function.
	- asynclook -c (cancel) feature.
	- fix fail to allocate context actions.
	- make pipe nonblocking at start.
	- update plane for retry mode with caution to limit bandwidth.
	- fix Makefile for concurrent make of unbound-host.
	- renamed ub_val_ctx_wait/poll/process/fd to ub_val*.
	- new calls to set forwarding added to header and docs.

23 January 2008: Wouter
	- removed debug prints from if-auto, verb-algo enables some.
	- libunbound QUIT setup, remove memory leaks, when using threads
	  will share memory for passing results instead of writing it over
	  the pipe, only writes ID number over the pipe (towards the handler
	  thread that does process() ).

22 January 2008: Wouter
	- library code for async in libunbound/unbound.c.
	- fix link testbound.
	- fixup exit bug in mini_event.
	- background worker query enter and result functions.
	- bg query test application asynclook, it looks up multiple
	  hostaddresses (A records) at the same time.

21 January 2008: Wouter
	- libworker work, netevent raw commpoints, write_msg, serialize.

18 January 2008: Wouter
	- touch up of manpage for libunbound.
	- support for IP_RECVDSTADDR (for *BSD ip4).
	- fix for BSD, do not use ip4to6 mapping, make two sockets, once
	  ip6 and once ip4, uses socket options.
	- goodbye ip4to6 mapping.
	- update ldns-testpkts with latest version from ldns-trunk.
	- updated makedist for relative ldns pathnames.
	- library API with more information inside the result structure.
	- work on background resolves.

17 January 2008: Wouter
	- fixup configure in case -lldns is installed.
	- fixup a couple of doxygen warnings, about enum variables.
	- interface-automatic now copies the interface address from the
	  PKT_INFO structure as well.
	- manual page with library API, all on one page 'man libunbound'.
	- rewrite of PKTINFO structure, it also captures IP4 PKTINFO.

16 January 2008: Wouter
	- incoming queries to the server with TC bit on are replied FORMERR.
	- interface-automatic replied the wrong source address on localhost
	  queries. Seems to be due to ifnum=0 in recvmsg PKTINFO. Trying
	  to use ifnum=-1 to mean 'no interface, use kernel route'.

15 January 2008: Wouter
	- interface-automatic feature. experimental. Nice for anycast.
	- tpkg test for ip6 ancillary data.
	- removed debug prints.
	- porting experience, define for Solaris, test refined for BSD
	  compatibility. The feature probably will not work on OpenBSD.
	- makedist fixup for ldns-src in build-dir.

14 January 2008: Wouter
	- in no debug sets NDEBUG to remove asserts.
	- configure --enable-debug is needed for dependency generation
	  for assertions and for compiler warnings.
	- ldns.tgz updated with ldns-trunk (where buffer.h is updated).
	- fix lint, unit test in optimize mode.
	- default access control allows ::ffff:127.0.0.1 v6mapped localhost.
	
11 January 2008: Wouter
	- man page, warning removed.
	- added text describing the use of stub zones for private zones.
	- checkconf tests for bad hostnames (IP address), and for doubled
	  interface lines.
	- memory sizes can be given with 'k', 'Kb', or M or G appended.

10 January 2008: Wouter
	- typo in example.conf.
	- made using ldns-src that is included the package more portable
	  by linking with .lo instead of .o files in the ldns package.
	- nicer do-ip6: yes/no documentation.
	- nicer linking of libevent .o files.
	- man pages render correctly on solaris.

9 January 2008: Wouter
	- fixup openssl RAND problem, when the system is not configured to
	  give entropy, and the rng needs to be seeded.

8 January 2008: Wouter
	- print median and quartiles with extensive logging.

4 January 2008: Wouter
	- document misconfiguration in private network.

2 January 2008: Wouter
	- fixup typo in requirements.
	- document that 'refused' is a better choice than 'drop' for 
	  the access control list, as refused will stop retries.

7 December 2007: Wouter
	- unbound-host has a -d option to show what happens. This can help
	  with debugging (why do I get this answer).
	- fixup CNAME handling, on nodata, sets and display canonname.
	- dot removed from CNAME display.
	- respect -v for NXDOMAINs.
	- updated ldns-src.tar.gz with ldns-trunk today (1.2.2 fixes).
	- size_t to int for portability of the header file.
	- fixup bogus handling.
	- dependencies and lint for unbound-host.

6 December 2007: Wouter
	- library resolution works in foreground mode, unbound-host app
	  receives data.
	- unbound-host prints rdata using ldns.
	- unbound-host accepts trust anchors, and prints validation
	  information when you give -v.

5 December 2007: Wouter
	- locking in context_new() inside the function.
	- setup of libworker.

4 December 2007: Wouter
	- minor Makefile fixup.
	- moved module-stack code out of daemon/daemon into services/modstack,
	  preparing for code-reuse.
	- move context into own header file.
	- context query structure.
	- removed unused variable pwd from checkconf.
	- removed unused assignment from outside netw.
	- check timeval length of string.
	- fixup error in val_utils getsigner.
	- fixup same (*var) error in netblocktostr.
	- fixup memleak on parse error in localzone.
	- fixup memleak on packet parse error.
	- put ; after union in parser.y.
	- small hardening in iter_operate against iq==NULL.
	- hardening, if error reply with rcode=0 (noerror) send servfail.
	- fixup same (*var) error in find_rrset in msgparse, was harmless.
	- check return value of evtimer_add().
	- fixup lockorder in lruhash_reclaim(), building up a list of locked
	  entries one at a time. Instead they are removed and unlocked.
	- fptr_wlist for markdelfunc.
	- removed is_locked param from lruhash delkeyfunc.
	- moved bin_unlock during bin_split purely to please.

3 December 2007: Wouter
	- changed checkconf/ to smallapp/ to make room for more support tools.
	  (such as unbound-host).
	- install dirs created with -m 755 because they need to be accessible.
	- library extensive featurelist added to TODO.
	- please doxygen, lint.
	- library test application, with basic functionality.
	- fix for building in a subdirectory. 
	- link lib fix for Leopard.

30 November 2007: Wouter
	- makefile that creates libunbound.la, basic file or libunbound.a
	  when creating static executables (no libtool).
	- more API setup.

29 November 2007: Wouter
	- 0.9 public API start.

28 November 2007: Wouter
	- Changeup plan for 0.8 - no complication needed, a simple solution
	  has been chosen for authoritative features.
	- you can use single quotes in the config file, so it is possible
	  to specify TXT records in local data.
	- fixup small memory problem in implicit transparent zone creation.
	- test for implicit zone creation and multiple RR RRsets local data.
	- local-zone nodefault test.
	- show testbound testlist on commit.
	- iterator normalizer changes CNAME chains ending in NXDOMAIN where
	  the packet got rcode NXDOMAIN into rcode NOERROR. (since the initial
	  domain exists).
	- nicer verbosity: 0 and 1 levels.
	- lower nonRDquery chance of eliciting wrongly typed validation
	  requiring message from the cache.
	- fix for nonRDquery validation typing; nodata is detected when
	  SOA record in auth section (all validation-requiring nodata messages
	  have a SOA record in authority, so this is OK for the validator),
	  and NS record is needed to be a referral.
	- duplicate checking when adding NSECs for a CNAME, and test.
	- created svn tag 0.8, after completing testbed tests.

27 November 2007: Wouter
	- per suggestion in rfc2308, replaced default max-ttl value with 1 day.
	- set size of msgparse lookup table to 32, from 1024, so that its size
	  is below the 2048 regional large size threshold, and does not cause
	  a call to malloc when a message is parsed.
	- update of memstats tool to print number of allocation calls.
	  This is what is taking time (not space) and indicates the avg size
	  of the allocations as well. region_alloc stat is removed.

22 November 2007: Wouter
	- noted EDNS in-the-middle dropping trouble as a TODO.
	  At this point theoretical, no user trouble has been reported.
	- added all default AS112 zones.
	- answers from local zone content.
		* positive answer, the rrset in question
		* nodata answer (exist, but not that type).
		* nxdomain answer (domain does not exist).
		* empty-nonterminal answer.
		* But not: wildcard, nsec, referral, rrsig, cname/dname,
			or additional section processing, NS put in auth.
	- test for correct working of static and transparent and couple
	  of important defaults (localhost, as112, reverses). 
	  Also checks deny and refuse settings.
	- fixup implicit zone generation and AA bit for NXDOMAIN on localdata.

21 November 2007: Wouter
	- local zone internal data setup.

20 November 2007: Wouter
	- 0.8 - str2list config support for double string config options.
	- local-zone and local-data options, config storage and documentation.

19 November 2007: Wouter
	- do not downcase NSEC and RRSIG for verification. Follows 
	  draft-ietf-dnsext-dnssec-bis-updates-06.txt.
	- fixup leaking unbound daemons at end of tests.
	- README file updated.
	- nice libevent not found error.
	- README talks about gnu make.
	- 0.8: unit test for addr_mask and fixups for it.
	  and unit test for addr_in_common().
	- 0.8: access-control config file element.
	  and unit test rpl replay file.
	- 0.8: fixup address reporting from netevent.

16 November 2007: Wouter
	- privilege separation is not needed in unbound at this time.
	  TODO item marked as such.
	- created beta-0.7 branch for support.
	- tagged 0.7 for beta release.
	- moved trunk to 0.8 for 0.8(auth features) development.
	- 0.8: access control list setup.

15 November 2007: Wouter
	- review fixups from Jelte.

14 November 2007: Wouter
	- testbed script does not recreate configure, since its in svn now.
	- fixup checkconf test so that it does not test 
	  /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.
	- tag 0.6.

13 November 2007: Wouter
	- remove debug print.
	- fixup testbound exit when LIBEVENT_SIGNAL_PROBLEM exists.

12 November 2007: Wouter
	- fixup signal handling where SIGTERM could be ignored if a SIGHUP
	  arrives later on.
	- bugreports to unbound-bugs@nlnetlabs.nl
	- fixup testbound so it exits cleanly.
	- cleanup the caches on a reload, so that rrsetID numbers won't clash.

9 November 2007: Wouter
	- took ldns snapshot in repo.
	- default config file is /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.
	  If it doesn't exist, it is installed with the doc/example.conf file.
	  The file is not deleted on uninstall.
	- default listening is not all, but localhost interfaces.
	
8 November 2007: Wouter
	- Fixup chroot and drop user privileges.
	- new L root ip address in default hints.

1 November 2007: Wouter
	- Fixup of crash on reload, due to anchors in env not NULLed after
	  dealloc during deinit.
	- Fixup of chroot call. Happens after privileges are dropped, so
	  that checking the passwd entry still works.
	- minor touch up of clear() hashtable function.
	- VERB_DETAIL prints out what chdir, username, chroot is being done.
	- when id numbers run out, caches are cleared, as in design notes.
	  Tested with a mock setup with very few bits in id, it worked.
	- harden-dnssec-stripped: yes is now default. It insists on dnssec
	  data for trust anchors. Included tests for the feature.

31 October 2007: Wouter
	- cache-max-ttl config option.
	- building outside sourcedir works again.
	- defaults more secure:
		username: "unbound"
		chroot: "/etc/unbound"
	  The operator can override them to be less secure ("") if necessary.
	- fix horrible oversight in sorting rrset references in a message,
	  sort per reference key pointer, not on referencepointer itself.
	- pidfile: "/etc/unbound/unbound.pid" is now the default.
	- tests changed to reflect the updated default.
	- created hashtable clear() function that respects locks.

30 October 2007: Wouter
	- fixup assertion failure that relied on compressed names to be
	  smaller than uncompressed names. A packet from comrite.com was seen
	  to be compressed to a larger size. Added it as unit test.
	- quieter logging at low verbosity level for common tcp messages.
	- no greedy TTL update.

23 October 2007: Wouter
	- fixup (grand-)parent problem for dnssec-lameness detection.
	- fixup tests to do additional section processing for lame replies,
	  since the detection needs that.
	- no longer trust in query section in reply during dnssec lame detect.
	- dnssec lameness does not make the server never ever queried, but
	  non-preferred. If no other servers exist or answer, the dnssec lame
	  server is used; the fastest dnssec lame server is chosen.
	- added test then when trust anchor cannot be primed (nodata), the
	  insecure mode from unbound works.
	- Fixup max queries per thread, any more are dropped.

22 October 2007: Wouter
	- added donotquerylocalhost config option. Can be turned off for
	  out test cases.
	- ISO C compat changes.
	- detect RA-no-AA lameness, as LAME.
	- DNSSEC-lameness detection, as LAME.
	  See notes in requirements.txt for choices made.
	- tests for lameness detection.
	- added all to make test target; need unbound for fwd tests.
	- testbound does not pollute /etc/unbound.

19 October 2007: Wouter
	- added configure (and its files) to svn, so that the trunk is easier
	  to use. ./configure, config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh,
	  and config.h.in.
	- added yacc/lex generated files, util/configlexer.c, 
	  util/configparser.c util/configparser.h, to svn. 
	- without lex no attempt to use it.
	- unsecure response validation collated into one block.
	- remove warning about const cast of cfgfile name.
	- outgoing-interfaces can be different from service interfaces.
	- ldns-src configure is done during unbound configure and
	  ldns-src make is done during unbound make, and so inherits the
	  make arguments from the unbound make invocation.
	- nicer error when libevent problem causes instant exit on signal.
	- read root hints from a root hint file (like BIND does).
	  
18 October 2007: Wouter
	- addresses are logged with errors.
	- fixup testcode fake event to remove pending before callback
	  since the callback may create new pending items.
	- tests updated because retries are now in iterator module.
	- ldns-testpkts code is checked for differences between unbound
	  and ldns by makedist.sh.
	- ldns trunk from today added in svn repo for fallback in case
	  no ldns is installed on the system.
	  make download_ldns refreshes the tarball with ldns svn trunk.
	- ldns-src.tar.gz is used if no ldns is found on the system, and
	  statically linked into unbound.
	- start of regional allocator code.
	- regional uses less memory and variables, simplified code.
	- remove of region-allocator.
	- alloc cache keeps a cache of recently released regional blocks,
	  up to a maximum.
	- make unit test cleanly free memory.

17 October 2007: Wouter
	- fixup another cycle detect and ns-addr timeout resolution bug.
	  This time by refusing delegations from the cache without addresses
	  when resolving a mandatory-glue nameserver-address for that zone.
	  We're going to have to ask a TLD server anyway; might as well be
	  the TLD server for this name. And this resolves a lot of cases where
	  the other nameserver names lead to cycles or are not available.
	- changed random generator from random(3) clone to arc4random wrapped
	  for thread safety. The random generator is initialised with
	  entropy from the system.
	- fix crash where failure to prime DNSKEY tried to print null pointer
	  in the log message.
	- removed some debug prints, only verb_algo (4) enables them.
	- fixup test; new random generator took new paths; such as one 
	  where no scripted answer was available.
	- mark insecure RRs as insecure.
	- fixup removal of nonsecure items from the additional.
	- reduced timeout values to more realistic, 376 msec (262 msec has
	  90% of roundtrip times, 512 msec has 99% of roundtrip times.)
	- server selection failover to next server after timeout (376 msec).

16 October 2007: Wouter
	- no malloc in log_hex.
	- assertions around system calls.
	- protect against gethostname without ending zero.
	- ntop output is null terminated by unbound.
	- pidfile content null termination
	- various snprintf use sizeof(stringbuf) instead of fixed constant.
	- changed loopdetect % 8 with & 0x7 since % can become negative for
	  weird negative input and particular interpretation of integer math.
	- dname_pkt_copy checks length of result, to protect result buffers.
	  prints an error, this should not happen. Bad strings should have
	  been rejected earlier in the program.
	- remove a size_t underflow from msgreply size func.

15 October 2007: Wouter
	- nicer warning.
	- fix IP6 TCP, wrong definition check. With test package.
	- fixup the fact that the query section was not compressed to,
	  the code was there but was called by value instead of by reference.
	  And test for the case, uses xxd and nc.
	- more portable ip6 check for sockaddr types.

8 October 2007: Wouter
	- --disable-rpath option in configure for 64bit systems with
	  several dynamic lib dirs.

7 October 2007: Wouter
	- fixup tests for no AD bit in non-DO queries.
	- test that makes sure AD bit is not set on non-DO query.

6 October 2007: Wouter
	- removed logfile open early. It did not have the proper permissions;
	  it was opened as root instead of the user. And we cannot change user
	  id yet, since chroot and bind ports need to be done.
	- callback checks for event callbacks done from mini_event. Because
	  of deletions cannot do this from netevent. This means when using
	  libevent the protection does not work on event-callbacks.
	- fixup too small reply (did not zero counts).
	- fixup reply no longer AD bit when query without DO bit.

5 October 2007: Wouter
	- function pointer whitelist.

4 October 2007: Wouter
	- overwrite sensitive random seed value after use.
	- switch to logfile very soon if not -d (console attached).
	- error messages do not reveal the trustanchor contents.
	- start work on function pointer whitelists.

3 October 2007: Wouter
	- fix for multiple empty nonterminals, after multiple DSes in the
	  chain of trust.
	- mesh checks if modules are looping, and stops them.
	- refetch with CNAMEd nameserver address regression test added.
	- fixup line count bug in testcode, so testbound prints correct line
	  number with parse errors.
	- unit test for multiple ENT case.
	- fix for cname out of validated unsec zone.
	- fixup nasty id=0 reuse. Also added assertions to detect its
	  return (the assertion catches in the existing test cases).

1 October 2007: Wouter
	- skip F77, CXX, objC tests in configure step.
	- fixup crash in refetch glue after a CNAME.
	  and protection against similar failures (with error print).

28 September 2007: Wouter
	- test case for unbound-checkconf, fixed so it also checks the
	  interface: statements.

26 September 2007: Wouter
	- SIGHUP will reopen the log file.
	- Option to log to syslog.
	- please lint, fixup tests (that went to syslog on open, oops).
	- config check program.

25 September 2007: Wouter
	- tests for NSEC3. Fixup bitmap checks for NSEC3.
	- positive ANY response needs to check if wildcard expansion, and
	  check that original data did not exist.
	- tests for NSEC3 that wrong use of OPTOUT is bad. For insecure
	  delegation, for abuse of child zone apex nsec3.
	- create 0.5 release tag.

24 September 2007: Wouter
	- do not make test programs by default.
	- But 'make test' will perform all of the tests.
	- Advertise builtin select libevent alternative when no libevent
	  is found.
	- signit can generate NSEC3 hashes, for generating tests.
	- multiple nsec3 parameters in message test.
	- too high nsec3 iterations becomes insecure test.

21 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup empty_DS_name allocated in wrong region (port DEC Alpha).
	- fixup testcode lock safety (port FreeBSD).
	- removes subscript has type char warnings (port Solaris 9).
	- fixup of field with format type to int (port MacOS/X intel).
	- added test for infinite loop case in nonRD answer validation.
	  It was a more general problem, but hard to reproduce. When an
	  unsigned rrset is being validated and the key fetched, the DS
	  sequence is followed, but if the final name has no DS, then no
	  proof is possible - the signature has been stripped off.

20 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup and test for NSEC wildcard with empty nonterminals. 
	- makedist.sh fixup for svn info.
	- acl features request in plan.
	- improved DS empty nonterminal handling.
	- compat with ANS nxdomain for empty nonterminals. Attempts the nodata
	  proof anyway, which succeeds in ANS failure case.
	- striplab protection in case it becomes -1.
	- plans for static and blacklist config.

19 September 2007: Wouter
	- comments about non-packed usage.
	- plan for overload support in 0.6.
	- added testbound tests for a failed resolution from the logs
	  and for failed prime when missing glue.
	- fixup so useless delegation points are not returned from the
	  cache. Also the safety belt is used if priming fails to complete.
	- fixup NSEC rdata not to be lowercased, bind compat.

18 September 2007: Wouter
	- wildcard nsec3 testcases, and fixup to get correct wildcard name.
	- validator prints subtype classification for debug.

17 September 2007: Wouter
	- NSEC3 hash cache unit test.
	- validator nsec3 nameerror test.

14 September 2007: Wouter
	- nsec3 nodata proof, nods proof, wildcard proof.
	- nsec3 support for cname chain ending in noerror or nodata.
	- validator calls nsec3 proof routines if no NSECs prove anything.
	- fixup iterator bug where it stored the answer to a cname under
	  the wrong qname into the cache. When prepending the cnames, the
	  qname has to be reset to the original qname.

13 September 2007: Wouter
	- nsec3 find matching and covering, ce proof, prove namerror msg.

12 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup of manual page warnings, like for NSD bugreport.
	- nsec3 work, config, max iterations, filter, and hash cache. 

6 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup to find libevent on mac port install.
	- fixup size_t vs unsigned portability in validator/sigcrypt.
	- please compiler on different platforms, for unreachable code.
	- val_nsec3 file.
	- pthread_rwlock type is optional, in case of old pthread libs.

5 September 2007: Wouter
	- cname, name error validator tests.
	- logging of qtype ANY works.
	- ANY type answers get RRSIG in answer section of replies (but not
	  in other sections, unless DO bit is on).
	- testbound can replay a TCP query (set MATCH TCP in the QUERY).
	- DS and noDS referral validation test.
	- if you configure many trust anchors, parent trust anchors can
	  securely deny existence of child trust anchors, if validated.
	- not all *.name NSECs are present because a wildcard was matched,
	  and *.name NSECs can prove nodata for empty nonterminals.
	  Also, for wildcard name NSECs, check they are not from the parent
	  zone (for wildcarded zone cuts), and check absence of CNAME bit,
	  for a nodata proof.
	- configure option for memory allocation debugging.
	- port configure option for memory allocation to solaris10.

4 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup of Leakage warning when serviced queries processed multiple
	  callbacks for the same query from the same server.
	- testbound removes config file from /tmp on failed exit.
	- fixup for referral cleanup of the additional section.
	- tests for cname, referral validation.
	- neater testbound tpkg output.
	- DNAMEs no longer match their apex when synthesized from the cache.
	- find correct signer name for DNAME responses.
	- wildcarded DNAME test and fixup code to detect.
	- prepend NSEC and NSEC3 rrsets in the iterator while chasing CNAMEs.
	  So that wildcarded CNAMEs get their NSEC with them to the answer.
	- test for a CNAME to a DNAME to a CNAME to an answer, all from
	  different domains, for key fetching and signature checking of
	  CNAME'd messages.

3 September 2007: Wouter
	- Fixed error in iterator that would cause assertion failure in 
	  validator. CNAME to a NXDOMAIN response was collated into a response
	  with both a CNAME and the NXDOMAIN rcode. Added a test that the
	  rcode is changed to NOERROR (because of the CNAME).
	- timeout on tcp does not lead to spurious leakage detect.
	- account memory for name of lame zones, so that memory leakages does
	  not show lame cache growth as a leakage growth.
	- config setting for lameness cache expressed in bytes, instead of
	  number of entries.
	- tool too summarize allocations per code line.

31 August 2007: Wouter
	- can read bind trusted-keys { ... }; files, in a compatibility mode. 
	- iterator should not detach target queries that it still could need.
	  the protection against multiple outstanding queries is moved to a
	  current_query num check.
	- validator nodata, positive, referral tests.
	- dname print can print '*' wildcard.

30 August 2007: Wouter
	- fixup override date config option.
	- config options to control memory usage.
	- caught bad free of un-alloced data in worker_send error case.
	- memory accounting for key cache (trust anchors and temporary cache).
	- memory accounting fixup for outside network tcp pending waits.
	- memory accounting fixup for outside network tcp callbacks.
	- memory accounting for iterator fixed storage.
	- key cache size and slabs config options.
	- lib crypto cleanups at exit. 

29 August 2007: Wouter
	- test tool to sign rrsets for testing validator with.
	- added RSA and DSA test keys, public and private pairs, 512 bits.
	- default configuration is with validation enabled.
	  Only a trust-anchor needs to be configured for DNSSEC to work.
	- do not convert to DER for DSA signature verification.
	- validator replay test file, for a DS to DNSKEY DSA key prime and
	  positive response.

28 August 2007: Wouter
	- removed double use for udp buffers, that could fail,
	  instead performs a malloc to do the backup.
	- validator validates referral messages, by validating all the rrsets
	  and stores the rrsets in the cache. Further referral (nonRD queries)
	  replies are made from the rrset cache directly. Unless unchecked
	  rrsets are encountered, there are then validated.
	- enforce that signing is done by a parent domain (or same domain).
	- adjust TTL downwards if rrset TTL bigger than signature allows.
	- permissive mode feature, sets AD bit for secure, but bogus does
	  not give servfail (bogus is changed into indeterminate).
	- optimization of rrset verification. rr canonical sorting is reused,
	  for the same rrset. canonical rrset image in buffer is reused for
	  the same signature.
	- if the rrset is too big (64k exactly + large owner name) the
	  canonicalization routine will fail if it does not fit in buffer.
	- faster verification for large sigsets.
	- verb_detail mode reports validation failures, but not the entire
	  algorithm for validation. Key prime failures are reported as 
	  verb_ops level.

27 August 2007: Wouter
	- do not garble the edns if a cache answer fails.
	- answer norecursive from cache if possible.
	- honor clean_additional setting when returning secure non-recursive
	  referrals.
	- do not store referral in msg cache for nonRD queries.
	- store verification status in the rrset cache to speed up future
	  verification.
	- mark rrsets indeterminate and insecure if they are found to be so.
	  and store this in the cache.

24 August 2007: Wouter
	- message is bogus if unsecure authority rrsets are present.
	- val-clean-additional option, so you can turn it off.
	- move rrset verification out of the specific proof types into one
	  routine. This makes the proof routines prettier.
	- fixup cname handling in validator, cname-to-positive and cname-to-
	  nodata work.
	- Do not synthesize DNSKEY and DS responses from the rrset cache if
	  the rrset is from the additional section. Signatures may have
	  fallen off the packet, and cause validation failure.
	- more verbose signature date errors (with the date attached).
	- increased default infrastructure cache size. It is important for
	  performance, and 1000 entries are only 212k (or a 400 k total cache
	  size). To 10000 entries (for 2M entries, 4M cache size).

23 August 2007: Wouter
	- CNAME handling - move needs_validation to before val_new().
	  val_new() setups the chase-reply to be an edited copy of the msg.
	  new classification, and find signer can find for it. 
	  removal of unsigned crap from additional, and query restart for
	  cname.
	- refuse to follow wildcarded DNAMEs when validating.
	  But you can query for qtype ANY, or qtype DNAME and validate that.

22 August 2007: Wouter
	- bogus TTL.
	- review - use val_error().

21 August 2007: Wouter
	- ANY response validation.
	- store security status in cache.
	- check cache security status and either send the query to be
	  validated, return the query to client, or send servfail to client.
	  Sets AD bit on validated replies.
	- do not examine security status on an error reply in mesh_done.
	- construct DS, DNSKEY messages from rrset cache.
	- manual page entry for override-date.

20 August 2007: Wouter
	- validate and positive validation, positive wildcard NSEC validation.
	- nodata validation, nxdomain validation.

18 August 2007: Wouter
	- process DNSKEY response in FINDKEY state.

17 August 2007: Wouter
	- work on DS2KE routine.
	- val_nsec.c for validator NSEC proofs.
	- unit test for NSEC bitmap reading.
	- dname iswild and canonical_compare with unit tests.

16 August 2007: Wouter
	- DS sig unit test.
	- latest release libevent 1.3c and 1.3d have threading fixed.
	- key entry fixup data pointer and ttl absolute.
	- This makes a key-prime succeed in validator, with DS or DNSKEY as
	  trust-anchor.
	- fixup canonical compare byfield routine, fix bug and also neater.
	- fixed iterator response type classification for queries of type
	  ANY and NS.
	  dig ANY gives sometimes NS rrset in AN and NS section, and parser
	  removes the NS section duplicate. dig NS gives sometimes the NS
	  in the answer section, as referral.
	- validator FINDKEY state.

15 August 2007: Wouter
	- crypto calls to verify signatures.
	- unit test for rrsig verification.

14 August 2007: Wouter
	- default outgoing ports changed to avoid port 2049 by default.
	  This port is widely blocked by firewalls.
	- count infra lameness cache in memory size.
	- accounting of memory improved
	- outbound entries are allocated in the query region they are for.
	- extensive debugging for memory allocations.
	- --enable-lock-checks can be used to enable lock checking.
	- protect undefs in config.h from autoheaders ministrations.
	- print all received udp packets. log hex will print on multiple
	  lines if needed.
	- fixed error in parser with backwards rrsig references.
	- mark cycle targets for iterator did not have CD flag so failed
	  its task.

13 August 2007: Wouter
	- fixup makefile, if lexer is missing give nice error and do not
	  mess up the dependencies.
	- canonical compare routine updated.
	- canonical hinfo compare.
	- printout list of the queries that the mesh is working on.

10 August 2007: Wouter
	- malloc and free overrides that track total allocation and frees.
	  for memory debugging.
	- work on canonical sort.

9 August 2007: Wouter
	- canonicalization, signature checks
	- dname signature label count and unit test.
	- added debug heap size print to memory printout.
	- typo fixup in worker.c
	- -R needed on solaris.
	- validator override option for date check testing.

8 August 2007: Wouter
	- ldns _raw routines created (in ldns trunk).
	- sigcrypt DS digest routines
	- val_utils uses sigcrypt to perform signature cryptography.
	- sigcrypt keyset processing

7 August 2007: Wouter
	- security status type.
	- security status is copied when rdata is equal for rrsets.
	- rrset id is updated to invalidate all the message cache entries
	  that refer to NSEC, NSEC3, DNAME rrsets that have changed.
	- val_util work
	- val_sigcrypt file for validator signature checks.

6 August 2007: Wouter
	- key cache for validator.
	- moved isroot and dellabel to own dname routines, with unit test.

3 August 2007: Wouter
	- replanning.
	- scrubber check section of lame NS set.
	- trust anchors can be in config file or read from zone file,
	  DS and DNSKEY entries.
	- unit test trust anchor storage.
	- trust anchors converted to packed rrsets.
	- key entry definition.

2 August 2007: Wouter
	- configure change for latest libevent trunk version (needs -lrt).
	- query_done and walk_supers are moved out of module interface.
	- fixup delegation point duplicates.
	- fixup iterator scrubber; lame NS set is let through the scrubber
	  so that the classification is lame.
	- validator module exists, and does nothing but pass through,
	  with calling of next module and return.
	- validator work.

1 August 2007: Wouter
	- set version to 0.5
	- module work for module to module interconnections.
	- config of modules.
	- detect cycle takes flags.

31 July 2007: Wouter
	- updated plan
	- release 0.4 tag.

30 July 2007: Wouter
	- changed random state init, so that sequential process IDs are not
	  cancelled out by sequential thread-ids in the random number seed.
	- the fwd_three test, which sends three queries to unbound, and 
	  unbound is kept waiting by ldns-testns for 3 seconds, failed
	  because the retry timeout for default by unbound is 3 seconds too,
	  it would hit that timeout and fail the test. Changed so that unbound
	  is kept waiting for 2 seconds instead.

27 July 2007: Wouter
	- removed useless -C debug option. It did not work.
	- text edit of documentation.
	- added doc/CREDITS file, referred to by the manpages.
	- updated planning.

26 July 2007: Wouter
	- cycle detection, for query state dependencies. Will attempt to
	  circumvent the cycle, but if no other targets available fails.
	- unit test for AXFR, IXFR response.
	- test for cycle detection.

25 July 2007: Wouter
	- testbound read ADDRESS and check it.
	- test for version.bind and friends.
	- test for iterator chaining through several referrals.
	- test and fixup for refetch for glue. Refetch fails if glue
	  is still not provided.

24 July 2007: Wouter
	- Example section in config manual.
	- Addr stored for range and moment in replay.

20 July 2007: Wouter
	- Check CNAME chain before returning cache entry with CNAMEs.
	- Option harden-glue, default is on. It will discard out of zone
	  data. If disabled, performance is faster, but spoofing attempts
	  become a possibility. Note that still normalize scrubbing is done,
	  and that the potentially spoofed data is used for infrastructure
	  and not returned to the client.
	- if glue times out, refetch by asking parent of delegation again.
	  Much like asking for DS at the parent side.
	- TODO items from forgery-resilience draft.
	  and on memory handling improvements.
	- renamed module_event_timeout to module_event_noreply.
	- memory reporting code; reports on memory usage after handling
	  a network packet (not on cache replies).

19 July 2007: Wouter
	- shuffle NS selection when getting nameserver target addresses.
	- fixup of deadlock warnings, yield cpu in checklock code so that
	  freebsd scheduler selects correct process to run.
	- added identity and version config options and replies.
	- store cname messages complete answers.

18 July 2007: Wouter
	- do not query addresses, 127.0.0.1, and ::1 by default.

17 July 2007: Wouter
	- forward zone options in config file.
	- forward per zone in iterator. takes precedence over stubs.
	- fixup commithooks.
	- removed forward-to and forward-to-port features, subsumed by
	  new forward zones.
	- fix parser to handle absent server: clause.
	- change untrusted rrset test to account for scrubber that is now
	  applied during the test (which removes the poison, by the way).
	- feature, addresses can be specified with @portnumber, like nsd.conf.
	- test config files changed over to new forwarder syntax.

27 June 2007: Wouter
	- delete of mesh does a postorder traverse of the tree.
	- found and fixed a memory leak. For TTL=0 messages, that would
	  not be cached, instead the msg-replyinfo structure was leaked.
	- changed server selection so it will filter out hosts that are
	  unresponsive. This is defined as a host with the maximum rto value.
	  This means that unbound tried the host for retries up to 120 secs.
	  The rto value will time out after host-ttl seconds from the cache.
	  This keeps such unresolvable queries from taking up resources.
	- utility for keeping histogram.

26 June 2007: Wouter
	- mesh is called by worker, and iterator uses it.
	  This removes the hierarchical code.
	  QueryTargets state and Finished state are merged for iterator.
	- forwarder mode no longer sets AA bit on first reply.
	- rcode in walk_supers is not needed.

25 June 2007: Wouter
	- more mesh work.
	- error encode routine for ease.

22 June 2007: Wouter
	- removed unused _node iterator value from rbtree_t. Takes up space.
	- iterator can handle querytargets state without a delegation point
	  set, so that a priming(stub) subquery error can be handled.
	- iterator stores if it is priming or not.
	- log_query_info() neater logging.
	- changed iterator so that it does not alter module_qstate.qinfo
	  but keeps a chase query info. Also query_flags are not altered,
	  the iterator uses chase_flags.
	- fixup crash in case no ports for the family exist.

21 June 2007: Wouter
	- Fixup secondary buffer in case of error callback.
	- cleanup slumber list of runnable states.
	- module_subreq_depth fails to work in slumber list.
	- fixup query release for cached results to sub targets.
	- neater error for tcp connection failure, shows addr in verbose.
	- rbtree_init so that it can be used with preallocated memory.

20 June 2007: Wouter
	- new -C option to enable coredumps after forking away.
	- doc update.
	- fixup CNAME generation by scrubber, and memory allocation of it.
	- fixup deletion of serviced queries when all callbacks delete too.
	- set num target queries to 0 when you move them to slumber list.
	- typo in check caused subquery errors to be ignored, fixed.
	- make lint happy about rlim_t.
	- freeup of modules after freeup of module-states.
	- duplicate replies work, this uses secondary udp buffer in outnet.

19 June 2007: Wouter
	- nicer layout in stats.c, review 0.3 change.
	- spelling improvement, review 0.3 change.
	- uncapped timeout for server selection, so that very fast or slow
	  servers will stand out from the rest.
	- target-fetch-policy: "3 2 1 0 0" config setting.
	- fixup queries answered without RD bit (for root prime results).
	- refuse AXFR and IXFR requests.
	- fixup RD flag in error reply from iterator. fixup RA flag from
	  worker error reply.
	- fixup encoding of very short edns buffer sizes, now sets TC bit.
	- config options harden-short-bufsize and harden-large-queries.

18 June 2007: Wouter
	- same, move subqueries to slumber list when first has resolved.
	- fixup last fix for duplicate callbacks.
	- another offbyone in targetcounter. Also in Java prototype by the way.

15 June 2007: Wouter
	- if a query asks to be notified of the same serviced query result
	  multiple times, this will succeed. Only one callback will happen;
	  multiple outbound-list entries result (but the double cleanup of it
	  will not matter).
	- when iterator moves on due to CNAME or referral, it will remove
	  the subqueries (for other targets). These are put on the slumber
	  list.
	- state module wait subq is OK with no new subqs, an old one may have
	  stopped, with an error, and it is still waiting for other ones.
	- if a query loops, halt entire query (easy way to clean up properly).

14 June 2007: Wouter
	- num query targets was > 0 , not >= 0 compared, so that fetch
	  policy of 0 did nothing.

13 June 2007: Wouter
	- debug option: configure --enable-static-exe for compile where
	  ldns and libevent are linked statically. Default is off.
	- make install and make uninstall. Works with static-exe and without.
	  installation of unbound binary and manual pages.
	- alignment problem fix on solaris 64.
	- fixup address in case of TCP error.

12 June 2007: Wouter
	- num target queries was set to 0 at a bad time. Default it to 0 and
	  increase as target queries are done.
	- synthesize CNAME and DNAME responses from the cache.
	- Updated doxygen config for doxygen 1.5.
	- aclocal newer version.
	- doxygen 1.5 fixes for comments (for the strict check on docs).

11 June 2007: Wouter
	- replies on TCP queries have the address field set in replyinfo,
	  for serviced queries, because the initiator does not know that
	  a TCP fallback has occured.
	- omit DNSSEC types from nonDO replies, except if qtype is ANY or
	  if qtype directly queries for the type (and then only show that
	  'unknown type' in the answer section).
	- fixed message parsing where rrsigs on their own would be put
	  in the signature list over the rrsig type.

7 June 2007: Wouter
	- fixup error in double linked list insertion for subqueries and
	  for outbound list of serviced queries for iterator module.
	- nicer printout of outgoing port selection. 
	- fixup cname target readout.
	- nicer debug output.
	- fixup rrset counts when prepending CNAMEs to the answer.
	- fixup rrset TTL for prepended CNAMEs.
	- process better check for looping modules, and which submodule to

	  But only for answers from other servers, not for plain queries.
	- compression and decompression test cases.
	- some stats added.
	- example.conf interface: line is changed from 127.0.0.1 which leads
