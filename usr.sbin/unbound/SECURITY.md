# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

NLnet Labs adheres to the straightforward, semantic versioning scheme that is
commonly used in the software industry.

Support is provided in respect of the latest release, i.e. releases with the
highest minor and patch version level. We do not backport security fixes to
older (minor) versions. In the event a new major version is released (e.g.  from
3.2.18 to 4.0.0), support will also be provided on the latest minor  version of
the previous major version (3.2.18) for a period of one year from the release of
the new major version (4.0.0).

In the event that, during this period, a new patch or minor version of the
previous major version is released, then support on these versions will only be
provided for the remainder of the one-year-period.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security very seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability
in one of our projects and you would like to report it to us, you can send an
encrypted message to our Security Entry Point.
