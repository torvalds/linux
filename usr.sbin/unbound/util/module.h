/**
 * \file
 *
 * This file contains the interface for DNS handling modules.
 *
 * The module interface uses the DNS modules as state machines.  The
 * state machines are activated in sequence to operate on queries.  Once
 * they are done, the reply is passed back.  In the usual setup the mesh
 * is the caller of the state machines and once things are done sends replies
 * and invokes result callbacks.
 *
 * The module provides a number of functions, listed in the module_func_block.
 * The module is inited and destroyed and memory usage queries, for the
 * module as a whole, for entire-module state (such as a cache).  And per-query
 * functions are called, operate to move the state machine and cleanup of
 * the per-query state.
 *
 * Most per-query state should simply be allocated in the query region.
 * This is destroyed at the end of the query.
 *
 * The module environment contains services and information and caches
 * shared by the modules and the rest of the system.  It also contains
 * function pointers for module-specific tasks (like sending queries).
 *
 * *** Example module calls for a normal query
 *
 * In this example, the query does not need recursion, all the other data
 * can be found in the cache.  This makes the example shorter.
 *
 * At the start of the program the iterator module is initialised.
 * The iterator module sets up its global state, such as donotquery lists
 * and private address trees.
 *
 * A query comes in, and a mesh entry is created for it.  The mesh
 * starts the resolution process.  The validator module is the first
 * in the list of modules, and it is started on this new query.  The
 * operate() function is called.  The validator decides it needs not do
 * anything yet until there is a result and returns wait_module, that
 * causes the next module in the list to be started.
 *
 * The next module is the iterator.  It is started on the passed query and
 * decides to perform a lookup.  For this simple example, the delegation
 * point information is available, and all the iterator wants to do is
 * send a UDP query.  The iterator uses env.send_query() to send the
 * query.  Then the iterator suspends (returns from the operate call).
 *
 * When the UDP reply comes back (and on errors and timeouts), the
 * operate function is called for the query, on the iterator module,
 * with the event that there is a reply.  The iterator decides that this
 * is enough, the work is done.  It returns the value finished from the
 * operate call, which causes the previous module to be started.
 *
 * The previous module, the validator module, is started with the event
 * that the iterator module is done.  The validator decides to validate
 * the query.  Once it is done (which could take recursive lookups, but
 * in this example no recursive lookups are needed), it returns from the
 * operate function with finished.
 *
 * There is no previous module from the validator module, and the mesh
 * takes this to mean that the query is finally done.  The mesh invokes
 * callbacks and sends packets to queriers.
 *
 * If other modules had been waiting (recursively) on the answer to this
 * query, then the mesh will tell them about it.  It calls the inform_super
 * routine on all the waiting modules, and once that is done it calls all of
 * them with the operate() call.  During inform_super the query that is done
 * still exists and information can be copied from it (but the module should
 * not really re-entry codepoints and services).  During the operate call
 * the modules can use stored state to continue operation with the results.
 * (network buffers are used to contain the answer packet during the
 * inform_super phase, but after that the network buffers will be cleared
 * of their contents so that other tasks can be performed).
 *
 * *** Example module calls for recursion
 *
 * A module is called in operate, and it decides that it wants to perform
 * recursion.  That is, it wants the full state-machine-list to operate on
 * a different query.  It calls env.attach_sub() to create a new query state.
 * The routine returns the newly created state, and potentially the module
 * can edit the module-states for the newly created query (i.e. pass along
 * some information, like delegation points).  The module then suspends,
 * returns from the operate routine.
 *
 * The mesh meanwhile will have the newly created query (or queries) on
 * a waiting list, and will call operate() on this query (or queries).
 * It starts again at the start of the module list for them.  The query
 * (or queries) continue to operate their state machines, until they are
 * done.  When they are done the mesh calls inform_super on the module that
 * wanted the recursion.  After that the mesh calls operate() on the module
 * that wanted to do the recursion, and during this phase the module could,
 * for example, decide to create more recursions.
 *
 * If the module decides it no longer wants the recursive information
 * it can call detach_subs.  Those queries will still run to completion,
 * potentially filling the cache with information.  Inform_super is not
 * called any more.
 *
 * The iterator module will fetch items from the cache, so a recursion
 * attempt may complete very quickly if the item is in cache.  The calling
 * module has to wait for completion or eventual timeout.  A recursive query
 * that times out returns a servfail rcode (servfail is also returned for
 * other errors during the lookup).
 *
 * Results are passed in the qstate, the rcode member is used to pass
 * errors without requiring memory allocation, so that the code can continue
 * in out-of-memory conditions.  If the rcode member is 0 (NOERROR) then
 * the dns_msg entry contains a filled out message.  This message may
 * also contain an rcode that is nonzero, but in this case additional
 * information (query, additional) can be passed along.
 *
 * The rcode and dns_msg are used to pass the result from the rightmost
 * module towards the leftmost modules and then towards the user.
 *
 * If you want to avoid recursion-cycles where queries need other queries
 * that need the first one, use detect_cycle() to see if that will happen.
