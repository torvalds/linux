/**
 * \file
 *
 * This file contains the unbound interface for use with user defined
 * pluggable event bases.
 *
 * Use ub_ctx_create_event_ub_base() to create an unbound context that uses
 * the user provided event base API.  Then, use the ub_resolve_event call
 * to add DNS resolve queries to the context.  Those then run with the
 * provided event_base, and when they are done you get a function callback.
 *
 * This method does not fork another process or create a thread, the effort
 * is done by the unbound state machines that are connected to the event base.
 *
 * It is also possible to provide a libevent based event base by using
 * ub_ctx_create_event_base().  But you have to use the same libevent that
 * unbound was compiled with, otherwise it wouldn't work, the event and
 * event_base structures would be different.
