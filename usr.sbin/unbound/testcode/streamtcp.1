sends a DNS Query of the given \fBtype\fR and \fBclass\fR for the given \fBname\fR
to the DNS server over TCP and displays the response.
.P
If the server to query is not given using the \fB\-f\fR option then localhost
(127.0.0.1) is used. More queries can be given on one commandline, they
are resolved in sequence.

.TP
.I name

.TP
.B \-n

.TP
.B \-s
Use SSL.
.TP
.B \-h
Print program usage.
.TP
.B \-f \fIipaddr[@port]
Specify the server to send the queries to. If not specified localhost (127.0.0.1) is used.
.TP
.B \-d \fIsecs
Delay after the connection before sending query.  This tests the timeout
on the other side, eg. if shorter the connection is closed.
.TP
.B \-p \fIclient
Use proxy protocol to send the query. Specify the ipaddr@portnr of the client
to include in PROXYv2.
.TP
.B IXFR=serial
Pass the type of the query as IXFR=N to send an IXFR query with serial N.
.TP
.B NOTIFY[=serial]
Pass the type of the query as NOTIFY[=N] to send a notify packet. The serial N
of the new zone can be included.
