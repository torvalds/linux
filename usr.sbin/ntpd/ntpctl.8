The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-s modifierX"
.It Fl s Cm all | peers | Sensors | status
Used to display information about the running daemon.
Keywords may be abbreviated.
.Pp
.Cm all
shows all data available.
.Pp
.Cm peers
shows the following information about each peer: weight, trustlevel,
stratum, number of seconds until the next poll, polling interval
in seconds, and offset, network delay and network jitter in milliseconds.
When the system clock is synced to a peer, an asterisk
is displayed to the left of the weight column for that peer.
.Pp
.Cm Sensors
shows the following information about each sensor: weight, sensor "good"
status, stratum, and offset and the configured correction in
milliseconds.
When the system clock is synced to a sensor, an asterisk
is displayed to the left of the weight column for that sensor.
.Pp
.Cm status
shows the status of peers and sensors, and whether the system clock is synced.
When the system clock is synced, the stratum is displayed.
When the system clock is not synced, the offset of the system clock,
as reported by the
.Xr adjtime 2
system call, is displayed.
When the median constraint is set, the offset to the local time is displayed.
