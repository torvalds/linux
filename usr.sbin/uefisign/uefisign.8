.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility signs PE binary files using Authenticode scheme, as required by
UEFI Secure Boot specification.
Alternatively, it can be used to view and verify existing signatures.
These options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl l"
.It Fl V
Determine whether the file is signed.
Note that this does not verify the correctness of the signature;
only that the file contains a signature.
.It Fl k
Name of file containing the private key used to sign the binary.
.It Fl c
Name of file containing the certificate used to sign the binary.
.It Fl o
Name of file to write the signed binary to.
.It Fl v

.Dl uefisign -c testcert.pem -k testcert.key -o signed-binary binary
.Pp
View signature:
.Dl uefisign -Vv binary
