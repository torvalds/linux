.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a hypervisor that runs guest operating systems inside a
virtual machine.
.Pp
Parameters such as the number of virtual CPUs, amount of guest memory, and
I/O connectivity can be specified with command-line parameters.
.Pp
If not using a boot ROM, the guest operating system must be loaded with
.Xr bhyveload 8
or a similar boot loader before running
.Nm ,
otherwise, it is enough to run
.Nm
with a boot ROM of choice.
.Pp
.Nm
runs until the guest operating system reboots or an unhandled hypervisor
exit is detected.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Fl a
The guest's local APIC is configured in xAPIC mode.
The xAPIC mode is the default setting so this option is redundant.
It will be deprecated in a future version.
.It Fl A
Generate ACPI tables.
Required for
.Fx Ns /amd64
guests.
.It Fl b
Enable a low-level console device supported by
.Fx
kernels compiled with
.Cd "device bvmconsole" .
This option will be deprecated in a future version.
.It Fl c Op Ar setting ...
Number of guest virtual CPUs
and/or the CPU topology.
The default value for each of
.Ar numcpus ,
.Ar sockets ,
.Ar cores ,
and
.Ar threads
is 1.
The current maximum number of guest virtual CPUs is 16.
If
.Ar numcpus
is not specified then it will be calculated from the other arguments.
The topology must be consistent in that the
.Ar numcpus
must equal the product of
.Ar sockets ,
.Ar cores ,
and
.Ar threads .
If a
.Ar setting
is specified more than once the last one has precedence.
.It Fl C
Include guest memory in core file.
.It Fl e
Force
.Nm
to exit when a guest issues an access to an I/O port that is not emulated.
This is intended for debug purposes.
.It Fl g Ar gdbport
For
.Fx
kernels compiled with
.Cd "device bvmdebug" ,
allow a remote kernel kgdb to be relayed to the guest kernel gdb stub
via a local IPv4 address and this port.
This option will be deprecated in a future version.
.It Fl G Ar port
Start a debug server that uses the GDB protocol to export guest state to a
debugger.
An IPv4 TCP socket will be bound to the supplied
.Ar port
to listen for debugger connections.
Only a single debugger may be attached to the debug server at a time.
If
.Ar port
begins with
.Sq w ,
.Nm
will pause execution at the first instruction waiting for a debugger to attach.
.It Fl h
Print help message and exit.
.It Fl H
Yield the virtual CPU thread when a HLT instruction is detected.
If this option is not specified, virtual CPUs will use 100% of a host CPU.
.It Fl l Op Ar help|lpcdev Ns Op , Ns Ar conf
Allow devices behind the LPC PCI-ISA bridge to be configured.
The only supported devices are the TTY-class devices
.Ar com1
and
.Ar com2
and the boot ROM device
.Ar bootrom .
.Pp
.Ar help
print a list of supported LPC devices.
.It Fl m Ar memsize Ns Op Ar K|k|M|m|G|g|T|t
Guest physical memory size in bytes.
This must be the same size that was given to
.Xr bhyveload 8 .
.Pp
The size argument may be suffixed with one of K, M, G or T (either upper
or lower case) to indicate a multiple of kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes,
or terabytes.
If no suffix is given, the value is assumed to be in megabytes.
.Pp
.Ar memsize
defaults to 256M.
.It Fl p Ar vcpu:hostcpu
Pin guest's virtual CPU
.Em vcpu
to
.Em hostcpu .
.It Fl P
Force the guest virtual CPU to exit when a PAUSE instruction is detected.
.It Fl s Op Ar help|slot,emulation Ns Op , Ns Ar conf
Configure a virtual PCI slot and function.
.Pp
.Nm
provides PCI bus emulation and virtual devices that can be attached to
slots on the bus.
There are 32 available slots, with the option of providing up to 8 functions
per slot.
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Ar help
print a list of supported PCI devices.
.It Ar slot
.Ar pcislot[:function]

.Ar function
value is 0 to 7.
The optional
.Ar bus
value is 0 to 255.
If not specified, the
.Ar function
value defaults to 0.
If not specified, the
.Ar bus
value defaults to 0.
.It Ar emulation
.Bl -tag -width 10n
.It Li hostbridge | Li amd_hostbridge
.Pp
Provide a simple host bridge.
This is usually configured at slot 0, and is required by most guest

Every port is named and corresponds to a Unix domain socket created by
.Nm .
.Nm
accepts at most one connection per port at a time.
.Pp
Limitations:
.Bl -bullet -offset 2n
.It
Due to lack of destructors in
.Nm ,
sockets on the filesystem must be cleaned up manually after
.Nm
exits.
.It
There is no way to use the "console port" feature, nor the console port
resize at present.
.It
Emergency write is advertised, but no-op at present.

If not specified, a default resolution of 1024x768 pixels will be used.
Minimal supported resolution is 640x480 pixels,
and maximum is 1920x1200 pixels.
.It Ar vgaconf
Possible values for this option are
.Dq io
(default),
.Dq on
, and
.Dq off .
PCI graphics cards have a dual personality in that they are
standard PCI devices with BAR addressing, but may also
implicitly decode legacy VGA I/O space
.Pq Ad 0x3c0-3df
and memory space
.Pq 64KB at Ad 0xA0000 .
The default
.Dq io
option should be used for guests that attempt to issue BIOS calls which result
in I/O port queries, and fail to boot if I/O decode is disabled.
.Pp
The
.Dq on
option should be used along with the CSM BIOS capability in UEFI
to boot traditional BIOS guests that require the legacy VGA I/O and
memory regions to be available.
.Pp
The
.Dq off
option should be used for the UEFI guests that assume that
VGA adapter is present if they detect the I/O ports.
An example of such a guest is
.Ox
in UEFI mode.
.Pp
Please refer to the
.Nm
.Fx
wiki page
.Pq Lk https://wiki.freebsd.org/bhyve
for configuration notes of particular guests.
.It wait
Instruct
.Nm
to only boot upon the initiation of a VNC connection, simplifying the
installation of operating systems that require immediate keyboard input.
This can be removed for post-installation use.
.It password
This type of authentication is known to be cryptographically weak and is not
intended for use on untrusted networks.
Many implementations will want to use stronger security, such as running
the session over an encrypted channel provided by IPsec or SSH.
.El
.El

.El
.Sh DEBUG SERVER
The current debug server provides limited support for debuggers.
.Ss Registers
Each virtual CPU is exposed to the debugger as a thread.
.Pp
General purpose registers can be queried for each virtual CPU, but other
registers such as floating-point and system registers cannot be queried.
.Ss Memory
Memory (including memory mapped I/O regions) can be read by the debugger,
but not written.
Memory operations use virtual addresses that are resolved to physical addresses
via the current virtual CPU's active address translation.
.Ss Control
The running guest can be interrupted by the debugger at any time
.Pq for example, by pressing Ctrl-C in the debugger .
.Pp
Single stepping is only supported on Intel CPUs supporting the MTRAP VM exit.
.Pp
Breakpoints are not supported.
.Sh SIGNAL HANDLING
.Nm
deals with the following signals:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It SIGTERM

.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
If not using a boot ROM, the guest operating system must have been loaded with
.Xr bhyveload 8
or a similar boot loader before
.Xr bhyve 4
can be run.
Otherwise, the boot loader is not needed.
