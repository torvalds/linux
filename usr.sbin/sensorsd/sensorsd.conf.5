.Sh NAME
.Nm sensorsd.conf
.Nd configuration file for sensorsd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is read by
.Xr sensorsd 8
to configure hardware sensor monitoring.
Each variable in the
.Xr sysctl 2
.Va hw.sensors
subtree represents a sensor.
Each sensor is matched by at most one entry in
.Nm ,
which may specify high and low limits,
and whether sensor status changes provided by the driver should be ignored.
Each time the limits are crossed in either direction
or the status provided by the driver changes,
.Xr sensorsd 8 Ns 's
alert functionality is triggered and a command, if specified, is
executed.
.Pp
.Nm
follows the syntax of configuration databases as documented in
.Xr cgetent 3 .
Sensors may be specified by their full
.Va hw.sensors
.Xr sysctl 8
variable name or by type,
with the full name taking precedence.
For example, if an entry
.Dq hw.sensors.lm0.temp1
is not found, then an entry for
.Dq temp
will instead be looked for.
.Pp
The following attributes may be used:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "commandXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Li command
Specify a command to be executed on state change.
.It Li high
Specify the largest acceptable value.
.It Li low
Specify the smallest acceptable value.
.It Li istatus
Ignore status provided by the driver.
.El
.Pp
The values for temperature sensors can be given in degrees Celsius or
Fahrenheit, for voltage sensors in volts, and fan speed sensors take a
unit-less number representing RPM.
For Boolean sensors, specify 0 for
.Qq Off
or 1 for
.Qq On .
Values for all other types of sensors can be specified
in the same units as they appear under the
.Xr sysctl 8
.Va hw.sensors
tree.
.Pp
Sensors that provide status (such as those from
.Xr bio 4 ,
.Xr esm 4 ,
or
.Xr ipmi 4 )
do not require boundary values specified
and simply trigger on status transitions.
If boundaries are specified nonetheless,
then they are used in addition to automatic status monitoring,
unless the
.Dq istatus
attribute is specified to ignore status values that are provided by the drivers.
.Pp
The command is executed when there is any change in sensor state.
Tokens in the command are substituted as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It %l
Whether the value exceeds or is within the user specified limits.
Can be one of: "below", "above", "within", "invalid", or "uninitialised".
.It %n
The sensor number.
.It %s
The sensor status.
.It %x
The xname of the device the sensor sits on.
.It %t
The type of sensor.
.It %2
The sensor's current value.
.It %3
The sensor's low limit.
.It %4
The sensor's high limit.
.El
.Pp
For Boolean sensors, %2, %3, and %4 are substituted with
.Qq On
or
.Qq Off .
.Pp
By default,
.Xr sensorsd 8
monitors status changes on all sensors that keep their state.
This behaviour may be altered by using the
.Dq istatus
attribute to ignore
status changes of sensors of a certain type
or individual sensors.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/examples/sensorsd.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/sensorsd.conf
Configuration file for
.Xr sensorsd 8 .
.It Pa /etc/examples/sensorsd.conf
Example configuration file.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
In the following configuration file,
if hw.sensors.ipmi0.temp0 moves upwards beyond 80C
or downwards to 80C or less or if its status as provided by
.Xr ipmi 4
changes, the command
.Pa /etc/sensorsd/log_warning
will be executed,
with the sensor type, number and current value passed to it.
Alerts will be sent
if hw.sensors.lm0.volt3 moves into or out of
the range from 4.8V to 5.2V, inclusive;
if the speed of the fan attached to hw.sensors.lm0.fan1
transitions to being below or above 1000RPM;
if any RAID volume drive
changes its status from, for example,
.Dq OK ,
such as in the case of drive failure, rebuild, or a complete failure,
the command
.Pa /etc/sensorsd/drive
will be executed, with the sensor number passed to it; however,
no alerts will be generated for status changes on timedelta sensors.
For all other sensors whose drivers automatically provide
sensor status updates, alerts will be generated
each time those sensors undergo status transitions.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
file format first appeared in
.Ox 3.5 .
The format was altered in
.Ox 4.1
to accommodate hierarchical device-based sensor addressing.
The
.Dq istatus
attribute was introduced in
.Ox 4.2 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Alert functionality is triggered every time there is a change in sensor state;
for example, when
.Xr sensorsd 8
is started,
the status of each monitored sensor changes
from undefined to whatever it is.
One must keep this in mind when using commands
that may unconditionally perform adverse actions (e.g.\&
.Xr shutdown 8 ) ,
as they will be executed even when all sensors perform to specification.
If this is undesirable, then a wrapper shell script should be used instead.
