.Dt FORWARD 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm forward
.Nd email forwarding information file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Users may put a
.Nm .forward
file in their home directory.
If this file exists,
.Xr smtpd 8
forwards email to the destinations specified therein.
.Pp
A
.Nm .forward
file contains a list of expansion values, as described in
.Xr aliases 5 .
Each expansion value should be on a line by itself.
Expansion is performed under the user ID of the
.Nm .forward
file owner.
.Pp
Permissions on the
.Nm .forward
file are very strict and expansion is rejected if the file is
group or world-writable;
if the home directory is group writeable;
or if the file is not owned by the user.
.Pp
Users should avoid editing the
.Nm .forward
file directly, to prevent delivery failures from occurring if a message
arrives while the file is not fully written.
The best option is to use a temporary file and use the
.Xr mv 1
command to atomically overwrite the former
.Nm .forward .
Alternatively, setting the
.Xr sticky 8
bit on the home directory will cause the
.Nm .forward
lookup to return a temporary failure, causing mails to be deferred.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "~/.forwardXXX" -compact
.It Pa ~/.forward
Email forwarding information.

.Sh EXAMPLES
