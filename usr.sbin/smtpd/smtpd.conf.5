.Sh NAME
.Nm smtpd.conf
.Nd SMTP daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the mail daemon
.Xr smtpd 8 .
.Pp
When mail arrives,
each
.Dq RCPT TO:
command generates a mail envelope.
If an envelope matches
any of a pre-designated set of criteria
(using the
.Ic match
directive),
the message is accepted for delivery.
A copy of the message, as well as its associated envelopes,
is saved in the mail queue and later dispatched
according to an associated set of actions
(using the
.Ic action
directive).
If an envelope does not match any options,
it is rejected.
The match rules are evaluated sequentially,
with the first match winning.
.Pp
The format of the configuration file is fairly flexible.
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore,
as well as reserved words
(such as
.Ic listen ,
.Ic match ,
and
.Cm port ) ,
must be quoted.
Arguments containing whitespace should be surrounded by double quotes
.Pq \&" .
.Pp
A macro is defined with a command of the form
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value .
The macro
.Ar name
can contain letters, digits, and underscores and cannot be a reserved word.
Within unquoted arguments, the string
.Pf $ Ar name
is later expanded to
.Ar value .
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lan_addr = "192.168.0.1"
listen on $lan_addr
listen on $lan_addr tls auth
.Ed
.Pp
The syntax of
.Nm
is described below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic action Ar name method Op Ar options
When the queue runner processes an envelope from the mail queue,
it carries out the
.Ic action
.Ar name ,
selected by the
.Ic match No ... Cm action
directive when the message was received.
The
.Ic action
directive provides configuration data for delivery attempts.
Required lookups are performed at the time of each delivery attempt.
Consequently, changing an
.Ic action
directive or the files it references and restarting the
.Xr smtpd 8
daemon causes the changes to take effect for subsequent delivery
attempts for the respective dispatcher
.Ar name ,
even for messages that were already stuck in the queue
prior to the configuration changes.
.Pp
The delivery
.Ar method
parameter may be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm expand-only
Only accept the message if a delivery method was specified
in an aliases or
.Pa .forward
file.
.It Cm forward-only
Only accept the message if the recipient results in a remote address
after the processing of aliases or forward file.
.It Cm lmtp Ar destination Op Cm rcpt-to
Deliver the message to an LMTP server at
.Ar destination .
The location may be expressed as host:port or as a UNIX socket.
.Pp
Optionally,
.Cm rcpt-to
might be specified to use the
recipient email address (after expansion) instead of the
local user in the LMTP session as RCPT TO.
.It Cm maildir Oo Ar pathname Oc Op Cm junk
Deliver the message to the maildir in
.Ar pathname
if specified, or by default to
.Pa ~/Maildir .
.Pp
The
.Ar pathname
may contain format specifiers that are expanded before use
.Pq see Sx FORMAT SPECIFIERS .
.Pp
If the
.Cm junk
argument is provided, the message will be moved to the
.Ql Junk
folder if it contains a positive
.Ql X-Spam
header.
This folder will be created under
.Ar pathname
if it does not yet exist.
.It Cm mbox
Deliver the message to the user's mbox with
.Xr mail.local 8 .
.It Cm mda Ar command
Delegate the delivery to a
.Ar command
that receives the message on its standard input
.Pq see Sx MDA COMMANDS .
.Pp
The
.Ar command
may contain format specifiers that are expanded before use

is in charge of handling delivery for all virtual users.
.Pp
This option is not usable with the
.Cm mbox
delivery method.
.Pp
Only the delivery user's
.Pa .forward
file will be processed.
.It Cm userbase Pf < Ar table Ns >
Use the mapping
.Ar table
for user lookups instead of the
.Xr getpwnam 3
function.
.Pp
The
.Cm userbase
does not apply to the
.Cm user
option.
.It Cm virtual Pf < Ar table Ns >
Use the mapping
.Ar table
for virtual expansion.
The aliasing table format is described in

multiple pairs as a comma-separated (whitespace optional) list.
.El
.Ss MAIL FILTERING
In a regular workflow,
.Xr smtpd 8
may accept or reject a message based only on the content of envelopes.
Its decisions are about the handling of the message,
not about the handling of an active session.
.Pp
Filtering extends the decision making process by allowing
.Xr smtpd 8
to stop at each phase of an SMTP session,
check that conditions are met,
then decide if a session is allowed to move forward.
.Pp
With filtering,
a session may be interrupted at any phase before an envelope is complete.
A message may also be rejected after being submitted,
regardless of whether the envelope was accepted or not.
.Pp
The following phases are currently supported:
.Bl -column mail-from -offset indent
.It connect    Ta upon connection, before a banner is displayed
.It helo       Ta after HELO command is submitted
.It ehlo       Ta after EHLO command is submitted
.It mail-from Ta after MAIL FROM command is submitted
.It rcpt-to   Ta after RCPT TO command is submitted
.It data       Ta after DATA command is submitted
.It commit     Ta after message is fully submitted
.El
.Pp
At each phase, various conditions may be matched.
The fcrdns, rdns, and src data are available in all phases,
but other data must have been already submitted before they are available.
.Bl -column XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -offset indent
.It fcrdns                        Ta forward-confirmed reverse DNS is valid
.It rdns                          Ta session has a reverse DNS
.It rdns Pf < Ar table Ns >       Ta session has a reverse DNS in table
.It src Pf < Ar table Ns >        Ta source address is in table
.It helo Pf < Ar table Ns >       Ta helo name is in table
.It auth                          Ta session is authenticated
.It auth Pf < Ar table Ns >       Ta session username is in table
.It mail-from Pf < Ar table Ns >  Ta sender address is in table
.It rcpt-to Pf < Ar table Ns >    Ta recipient address is in table
.El
.Pp
These conditions may all be negated by prefixing them with an exclamation mark:
.Bl -column XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -offset indent
.It !fcrdns                     Ta forward-confirmed reverse DNS is invalid
.El
.Pp
Any conditions using a table may indicate that the table contains regular
expressions by prefixing the table name with the keyword regex.
.Bl -column XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -offset indent
.It helo regex Pf < Ar table Ns >       Ta helo name matches a regex in table
.El
.Pp
Finally, a number of decisions may be taken:
.Bl -column XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -offset indent
.It bypass                Ta the session or transaction bypasses filters
.It disconnect Ar message Ta the session is disconnected with message
.It junk                  Ta the session or transaction is junked, i.e., an
.Ql X-Spam: yes
header is added to any messages
.It reject Ar message     Ta the command is rejected with message
.It rewrite Ar value      Ta the command parameter is rewritten with value
.El
.Pp
Decisions that involve a message require that the message be RFC valid,
meaning that they should either start with a 4xx or 5xx status code.
Decisions can be taken at any phase,
though junking can only happen before a message is committed.
.Ss FORMAT SPECIFIERS
Some configuration directives support expansion of their parameters at runtime.
Such directives (for example
.Ic action Cm maildir ,
.Ic action Cm mda )
may use format specifiers which are expanded before delivery or
relaying.
The following formats are currently supported:
.Bl -column %{user.directory} -offset indent
.It %{sender}         Ta sender email address, may be empty string
.It %{sender.user}    Ta user part of the sender email address, may be empty
.It %{sender.domain}  Ta domain part of the sender email address, may be empty
.It %{rcpt}           Ta recipient email address
.It %{rcpt.user}      Ta user part of the recipient email address
.It %{rcpt.domain}    Ta domain part of the recipient email address
.It %{dest}           Ta recipient email address after expansion
.It %{dest.user}      Ta user part after expansion
.It %{dest.domain}    Ta domain part after expansion
.It %{user.username}  Ta local user
.It %{user.directory} Ta home directory of the local user
.It %{mbox.from}      Ta name used in mbox From separator lines
.It %{mda}            Ta mda command, only available for mda wrappers
.El
.Pp
Expansion formats also support partial expansion using the optional
bracket notations with substring offset.
For example, with recipient domain
.Dq example.org :
.Bl -column %{rcpt.domain[0:-4]} -offset indent
.It %{rcpt.domain[0]}    Ta expands to Dq e
.It %{rcpt.domain[1]}    Ta expands to Dq x
.It %{rcpt.domain[8:]}   Ta expands to Dq org
.It %{rcpt.domain[-3:]} Ta expands to Dq org
.It %{rcpt.domain[0:6]}  Ta expands to Dq example
.It %{rcpt.domain[0:-4]} Ta expands to Dq example
.El
.Pp
In addition, modifiers may be applied to the token.
For example, with recipient
.Dq User+Tag@Example.org :
.Bl -column %{rcpt:lowercase|strip} -offset indent
.It %{rcpt:lowercase}       Ta expands to Dq user+tag@example.org
.It %{rcpt:uppercase}       Ta expands to Dq USER+TAG@EXAMPLE.ORG
.It %{rcpt:strip}           Ta expands to Dq User@Example.org
.It %{rcpt:lowercase|strip} Ta expands to Dq user@example.org
.El
.Pp
For security concerns, expanded values are sanitized and potentially
dangerous characters are replaced with
.Sq \&: .
In situations where they are desirable, the
.Dq raw
modifier may be applied.
For example, with recipient
.Dq user+t?g@example.org :
.Bl -column %{rcpt:raw} -offset indent
.It %{rcpt}     Ta expands to Dq user+t:g@example.org
.It %{rcpt:raw} Ta expands to Dq user+t?g@example.org
.El
.Ss MDA COMMANDS
When an action delivery method is
.Cm mda ,
.Xr smtpd 8
runs the associated command for the delivery with the mail content
provided via standard input.
The command is expected to read all the mail content.
.Pp
The exit code of the command reports the outcome of the delivery:
status 0
.Pq Dv EX_OK
is a successful delivery; status 71
.Pq Dv EX_OSERR
and 75
.Pq Dv EX_TEMPFAIL
are temporary failures; and all other exit status are considered
permanent failures.
.Pp
The following environment variables are set:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ORIGINAL_RECIPIENT -compact
.It Ev DOMAIN
The recipient domain.
.It Ev EXTENSION
The sub address of the recipient (may be unset).
.It Ev HOME
The delivery user's login directory.
.It Ev LOCAL
The local part of the recipient user address.
.It Ev LOGNAME
The login name of the user.
.It Ev ORIGINAL_RECIPIENT
The address of the original recipient.
.It Ev PATH
Set to
.Ev _PATH_DEFPATH .
Traditionally
.Pa /usr/bin:/bin ,
but expanded to include
.Pa /usr/sbin ,
.Pa /sbin ,
.Pa /usr/X11R6/bin ,
.Pa /usr/local/bin ,
and
.Pa /usr/local/sbin
in
.Ox .
.It Ev RECIPIENT
The address of the final recipient.
.It Ev SENDER
The address of the sender (might be empty).
.It Ev SHELL
Set to
.Pa /bin/sh .
.It Ev USER
Synonym of
.Ev LOGNAME
for backwards compatibility.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/mail/smtpd.confXXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/mail/smtpd.conf
Default
.Xr smtpd 8
configuration file.
.It Pa /etc/mail/mailname
If this file exists,
the first line is used as the server name.
Otherwise, the server name is derived from the local hostname returned by
.Xr gethostname 3 ,
either directly if it is a fully qualified domain name,
or by retrieving the associated canonical name through
.Xr getaddrinfo 3 .
.It Pa /var/run/smtpd.sock
Unix domain socket for incoming SMTP connections.
.It Pa /var/spool/smtpd/
Spool directories for mail during processing.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The default
.Nm
file which ships with
.Ox
listens on the loopback network interface
.Pq Pa lo0
and allows for mail from users and daemons on the local machine,
as well as permitting email to remote servers.
Some more complex configurations are given below.
.Pp
This first example is similar to the default configuration,
but all outgoing mail is forwarded to a remote SMTP server.
A secrets file is needed to specify a username and password:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# touch /etc/mail/secrets
# chmod 640 /etc/mail/secrets
# chown root:_smtpd /etc/mail/secrets
# echo "bob username:password" > /etc/mail/secrets
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
would look like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
table aliases file:/etc/mail/aliases
table secrets file:/etc/mail/secrets

listen on lo0

action "local_mail" mbox alias <aliases>
action "outbound" relay host smtp+tls://bob@smtp.example.com \e
	auth <secrets>

match from local for local action "local_mail"
match from local for any action "outbound"
.Ed
.Pp
In this second example,
the aim is to permit mail delivery and relaying
only for users that can authenticate
(using their normal login credentials).
An RSA certificate must be provided to prove the server's identity.
The mail server listens on all interfaces the default routes point to.
Mail with a local destination is sent to an external MDA.
First, the RSA certificate is created:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# openssl genrsa \-out /etc/ssl/private/mail.example.com.key 4096
# openssl req \-new \-x509 \-key /etc/ssl/private/mail.example.com.key \e
	\-out /etc/ssl/mail.example.com.crt \-days 365
# chmod 600 /etc/ssl/mail.example.com.crt
# chmod 600 /etc/ssl/private/mail.example.com.key
.Ed
.Pp
In the example above,
a certificate valid for one year was created.
The configuration file would look like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pki mail.example.com cert "/etc/ssl/mail.example.com.crt"
pki mail.example.com key "/etc/ssl/private/mail.example.com.key"

table aliases file:/etc/mail/aliases

listen on lo0
listen on egress tls pki mail.example.com auth

action mda_with_aliases mda "/path/to/mda \-f \-" alias <aliases>
action mda_without_aliases mda "/path/to/mda \-f \-"
action "outbound" relay

match for local action mda_with_aliases
match from any for domain example.com action mda_without_aliases
match for any action "outbound"
match auth from any for any action "outbound"
.Ed
.Pp
For sites that wish to sign messages using DKIM,
the following example uses
.Sy opensmtpd-filter-dkimsign
for DKIM signing:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
table aliases file:/etc/mail/aliases

filter "dkimsign" proc-exec "filter-dkimsign -d <domain> -s <selector> \e
	-k /etc/mail/dkim/private.key" user _dkimsign group _dkimsign

listen on socket filter "dkimsign"
listen on lo0 filter "dkimsign"

action "local_mail" mbox alias <aliases>
action "outbound" relay

match for local action "local_mail"
match for any action "outbound"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, the
.Sy opensmtpd-filter-rspamd
package may be used to provide integration with
.Sy rspamd ,
a third-party daemon which provides multiple antispam features
as well as DKIM signing.
As well as configuring
.Sy rspamd
itself,
it requires use of the
.Cm proc-exec
keyword:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
filter "rspamd" proc-exec "filter-rspamd"
.Ed
.Pp
Sites that accept non-local messages may be able to cut down on the
volume of spam received by rejecting forged messages that claim
to be from the local domain.
The following example uses a list table
.Em other-relays
to specify the IP addresses of relays that may legitimately
originate mail with the owner's domain as the sender.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
table aliases file:/etc/mail/aliases
table other-relays file:/etc/mail/other-relays

listen on lo0
listen on egress

action "local_mail" mbox alias <aliases>
action "outbound" relay

match for local action "local_mail"
match for any action "outbound"
match !from src <other-relays> mail\-from "@example.com" for any \e
      reject
match from any for domain example.com action "local_mail"
