.Sh NAME
.Nm smtpd-filters
.Nd filtering API for the smtpd daemon
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr smtpd 8
daemon provides a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) implementation,
which allows ordinary machines to become Mail eXchangers (MX).
Some features that are commonly used by MX,
such as delivery reporting or spam filtering,
are outside the scope of SMTP and too complex to fit in
.Xr smtpd 8 .
.Pp
Because an MX may need to provide these features,
.Xr smtpd 8
provides an API to extend its behavior through
.Nm .
.Pp
At runtime,
.Xr smtpd 8
can report events to
.Nm ,
querying what it should answer to these events.
This allows the decision logic to rely on third-party programs.
.Sh DESIGN
.Nm
are programs that run as unique standalone processes,
they do not share
.Xr smtpd 8
memory space.
They are executed by
.Xr smtpd 8
at startup and expected to run in an infinite loop,
reading events and filtering requests from
.Xr stdin 4 ,
writing responses to
.Xr stdout 4
and logging to
.Xr stderr 4 .
They are not allowed to terminate.
.Pp
Because
.Nm
are standalone programs that communicate with
.Xr smtpd 8
through
.Xr fd 4 ,
they may run as different users than
.Xr smtpd 8
and may be written in any language.
.Nm
must not use blocking I/O,
they must support answering asynchronously to
.Xr smtpd 8 .
.Sh REPORT AND FILTER
The API relies on two streams,
report and filter.
.Pp
The report stream is a one-way stream which allows
.Xr smtpd 8
to inform
.Nm
in real-time about events.
Report events do not expect an answer from
.Nm ;
they are just meant to provide information.
A filter should be able to replicate the
.Xr smtpd 8
state for a session by gathering information coming from report events.
No decision is ever taken by the report stream.
.Pp
The filter stream is a two-way stream which allows
.Xr smtpd 8
to query
.Nm
about what it should do with a session at a given phase.
Filter requests expect an answer from
.Nm ;
.Xr smtpd 8
will not let the session move forward until then.
A decision must always be taken by the filter stream.
.Pp
It is sometimes possible to rely on filter requests to gather information,
but because a response is expected by
.Xr smtpd 8 ,
this is more costly than using report events.
The correct pattern for writing filters is to use report events to
create a local state for a session,
then use filter requests to take decisions based on this state.
The only case when using filter requests instead of report events is correct
is when a decision is required for the filter request and there is no need
for more information than that of the event itself.
.Sh PROTOCOL
The protocol consists of human-readable lines exchanged between
.Nm
and
.Xr smtpd 8 ,
through
.Xr fd 4 .
.Pp
The protocol begins with a handshake.
First,
.Xr smtpd 8
provides
.Nm
with general configuration information in the form of key-value lines:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
config|smtpd-version|7.7.0
config|protocol|0.7
config|smtp-session-timeout|300
config|subsystem|smtp-in
config|ready
.Ed
.Pp
Then,
.Nm
register the stream,
subsystem and event they want to handle:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
register|report|smtp-in|link-connect
register|ready
.Ed
.Pp
Finally,
.Xr smtpd 8
emits report events and filter requests,
expecting
.Nm
to respond or not depending on the stream:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
report|0.7|1576146008.006099|smtp-in|link-connect|7641df9771b4ed00|mail.openbsd.org|pass|199.185.178.25:33174|45.77.67.80:25
report|0.7|1576147242.200225|smtp-in|link-connect|7641dfb3798eb5bf|mail.openbsd.org|pass|199.185.178.25:31205|45.77.67.80:25
report|0.7|1576148447.982572|smtp-in|link-connect|7641dfc063102cbd|mail.openbsd.org|pass|199.185.178.25:24786|45.77.67.80:25
.Ed
.Pp
The character
.Dq |
may only appear in the last field of a payload,
in which case it should be considered a regular character and not a separator.
No other field may contain a
.Dq | .
.Pp
The list of subsystems and events,
as well as the format of requests and responses,
are documented in the sections below.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
During the initial handshake,
.Xr smtpd 8
emits a series of configuration keys and values.
The list is meant to be ignored by
.Nm
that do not require it and consumed gracefully by filters that do.
.Pp
There are currently three keys:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
config|smtpd-version|7.7.0
config|protocol|0.7
config|smtp-session-timeout|300
config|subsystem|smtp-in
.Ed
.Pp
When
.Xr smtpd 8
has sent all configuration keys, it emits the following line:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
config|ready
.Ed
.Sh REPORT EVENTS
There is currently only one subsystem supported in the API:
smtp-in.
.Pp
Each report event is generated by
.Xr smtpd 8
as a single line similar to the one below:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
report|0.7|1576146008.006099|smtp-in|link-connect|7641df9771b4ed00|mail.openbsd.org|pass|199.185.178.25:33174|45.77.67.80:25
.Ed
.Pp
The format consists of a protocol prefix containing the stream,
the protocol version,
the timestamp,
the subsystem,
the event and the unique session identifier,
separated by
.Dq | :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
report|0.7|1576146008.006099|smtp-in|link-connect|7641df9771b4ed00
.Ed
.Pp
It is followed by a suffix containing the event-specific parameters,
also separated by
.Dq | :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mail.openbsd.org|pass|199.185.178.25:33174|45.77.67.80:25
.Ed

.El
.Sh FILTER REQUESTS
There is currently only one subsystem supported in the API:
smtp-in.
.Pp
Filter requests allow
.Xr smtpd 8
to query
.Nm
about what to do with a session at a particular phase.
In addition,
they allow
.Nm
to alter the content of a message by adding,
modifying,
or suppressing lines of input in a way that is similar to what program like
.Xr sed 1
or
.Xr grep 1
would do.
.Pp
Each filter request is generated by
.Xr smtpd 8
as a single line similar to the one below.
Fields are separated by the
.Dq |
character.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
filter|0.7|1576146008.006099|smtp-in|connect|7641df9771b4ed00|1ef1c203cc576e5d|mail.openbsd.org|199.185.178.25
.Ed
.Pp
The format consists of a protocol prefix containing the stream,
the protocol version,
the timestamp,
the subsystem,
the filtering phase,
the unique session identifier and an opaque token that the filter
should provide in its response:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
filter|0.7|1576146008.006099|smtp-in|connect|7641df9771b4ed00|1ef1c203cc576e5d
.Ed
.Pp
It is followed by a suffix containing the phase-specific parameters of the
filter request,
also separated by
.Dq | :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mail.openbsd.org|199.185.178.25
.Ed
.Pp
Unlike with report events,
.Xr smtpd 8
expects answers from filter requests and will not allow a session to move
forward until the filter has instructed
.Xr smtpd 8
how to treat it.
.Pp
For all phases except
.Dq data-line ,
responses must follow the same construct:
a message of type
.Dq filter-result ,
followed by the unique session id,
the opaque token,
a decision and optional decision-specific parameters:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
filter-result|7641df9771b4ed00|1ef1c203cc576e5d|proceed
filter-result|7641df9771b4ed00|1ef1c203cc576e5d|reject|550 nope
.Ed
.Pp
The possible decisions for a
.Dq filter-result
message are documented below.
.Pp
For the
.Dq data-line
phase,
.Nm
are fed a stream of lines corresponding to the message to filter,
terminated by a single dot:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
filter|0.7|1576146008.006099|smtp-in|data-line|7641df9771b4ed00|1ef1c203cc576e5d|line 1
filter|0.7|1576146008.006103|smtp-in|data-line|7641df9771b4ed00|1ef1c203cc576e5d|line 2
filter|0.7|1576146008.006105|smtp-in|data-line|7641df9771b4ed00|1ef1c203cc576e5d|.
.Ed
.Pp
They are expected to return an output stream
similarly terminated by a single dot.
A filter may add to,
suppress,
modify or echo back the lines it receives.
Ultimately,
.Xr smtpd 8
assumes that the message consists of the output from
.Nm .
.Pp
Note that filters may be chained,
and the lines that are input into a subsequent filter
are the lines that are output from a previous filter.
.Pp
The response to
.Dq data-line
requests use their own construct.
A
.Dq filter-dataline
prefix,
followed by the unique session identifier,
the opaque token and the output line as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
filter-dataline|7641df9771b4ed00|1ef1c203cc576e5d|line 1
filter-dataline|7641df9771b4ed00|1ef1c203cc576e5d|line 2
filter-dataline|7641df9771b4ed00|1ef1c203cc576e5d|.
.Ed
.Pp
The list of events and event-specific parameters for smtp-in are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic connect : Ar rdns src
This request is emitted after connection,
before the banner is displayed.
.Pp
.Ar src
contains either the IP address of the source
(a.b.c.d for IPv4 or [x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x] IPv6)
or
.Dq local
(for UNIX sockets).
.It Ic helo : Ar identity
This request is emitted after the client has emitted
.Dq HELO .
.It Ic ehlo : Ar identity
This request is emitted after the client has emitted
.Dq EHLO .
.It Ic starttls : Ar tls-string
This request is emitted after the client has requested
.Dq STARTTLS .
.It Ic auth : Ar auth
This request is emitted after the client has requested
.Dq AUTH .
.It Ic mail-from : Ar address
This request is emitted after the client has requested
.Dq MAIL FROM .
.It Ic rcpt-to : Ar address
This request is emitted after the client has requested
.Dq RCPT TO .
.It Ic data
This request is emitted after the client has requested
.Dq DATA .
.It Ic data-line : Ar line
This request is emitted for each line of input in the
.Dq DATA
phase.
The lines are raw dot-escaped SMTP DATA input,
terminated with a single dot.
.It Ic commit
This request is emitted after the final single dot is received.
.El
.Pp
For every filtering phase,
excepted
.Dq data-line ,
the following decisions may be taken by a filter:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic proceed
No action is taken,
session or transaction may be passed to the next filter.
.It Ic junk
The session or transaction is marked as spam.
.Xr smtpd 8
will prepend an
.Dq X-Spam
header to the message.
.It Ic reject Ar error
The command is rejected with the message
.Ar error .
The message must be a valid SMTP message including status code,
5xx or 4xx.
.Pp
Messages starting with a 5xx status result in a permanent failure,
those starting with a 4xx status result in a temporary failure.
.Pp
Messages starting with a 421 status will result in a client disconnect.
.It Ic disconnect Ar error
The client is disconnected with the message
.Ar error .
The message must be a valid SMTP message including status code,
5xx or 4xx.
.Pp
Messages starting with a 5xx status result in a permanent failure,
those starting with a 4xx status result in a temporary failure.
.It Ic rewrite Ar parameter
The command parameter is rewritten.
.Pp
This decision allows a filter to perform a rewrite of client-submitted
commands before they are processed by the SMTP engine.
.Ar parameter
is expected to be a valid SMTP parameter for the command.
.It Ic report Ar parameter
Generates a report with
.Ar parameter
for this filter.
