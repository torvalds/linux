The
.Nm mailq
command is provided for compatibility with other MTAs
and is simply a shortcut for
.Cm show queue .
.Pp
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm discover Ar envelope-id | message-id
Schedule a single envelope, or all envelopes with the same message ID
that were manually moved to the queue.
.It Cm encrypt Op Ar string
Encrypt the password
.Ar string
to a representation suitable for user credentials and print it to the
standard output.
If
.Ar string
is not provided, cleartext passwords are read from standard input.
.Pp
It is advised to avoid providing the password as a parameter as it will be
visible from
.Xr top 1
and
.Xr ps 1
output.
.It Cm log brief

.Pp
When
.Nm smtpd
receives a message, it generates a
.Ar message-id
for the message, and one
.Ar envelope-id
per recipient.
The
.Ar message-id
is a 32-bit random identifier that is guaranteed to be
unique on the host system.
The
.Ar envelope-id
is a 64-bit unique identifier that encodes the
.Ar message-id
in the 32 upper bits and a random envelope identifier
in the 32 lower bits.
.Pp
A command which specifies a
.Ar message-id
applies to all recipients of a message;
a command which specifies an
.Ar envelope-id
applies to a specific recipient of a message.
