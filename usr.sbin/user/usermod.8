.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility modifies user login information on the system.
.Pp
Default values are taken from the information provided in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file, which, if running as root, is created using the built-in defaults if
it does not exist.
.Pp
After setting any defaults, and then reading values from
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf ,
the following command line options are processed:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar comment
Sets the comment field (also, for historical reasons known as the
GECOS field) which will be added for the user, and typically will include
the user's full name and, perhaps, contact information for the user.
.It Fl d Ar home-directory
Sets the home directory to
.Ar home-directory
without populating it; if the
.Fl m
option is specified, tries to move the old home directory to
.Ar home-directory .
.It Fl e Ar expiry-time
Sets the time at which the account expires.
It should be entered in the form
.Dq month day year ,
where month is the month name (the first three characters are
sufficient), day is the day of the month, and year is the year.
Time in seconds since the Epoch (UTC) is also valid.
A value of 0 can be used to disable this feature.
This value can be preset for new users using the
.Ar expire
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file.
See
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5
for more details.
.It Fl f Ar inactive-time
Sets the time at which the password expires.
See the
.Fl e
option.
.It Fl G Ar secondary-group Ns Op , Ns Ar group , Ns ...
Appends the user to the given groups in the
.Pa /etc/group
file.
.Fl G
and
.Fl S
are mutually exclusive.
.It Fl g Ar gid | name | Cm =uid
Gives the group name or identifier to be used for the user's primary group.
If this is the special string
.Cm =uid ,
.Nm
creates a group with the same ID as the UID;
if such a group already exists a warning is given
and no group is created.
Groups can be preset for all users by using the
.Ar group
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file.
See
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5
for more details.
.It Fl L Ar login-class
This option sets the login class for the user being created.
See
.Xr login.conf 5
for more information on user login classes.
This value can be preset for all users by using the
.Ar class
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file.
See
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5
for more details.
.It Fl l Ar new-login
Gives the new user name.
It must consist of alphanumeric characters, or the characters
.Ql \&. ,
.Ql \&-
or
.Ql \&_ .
.It Fl m
Moves the home directory from its old position to the new one.
If
.Fl d
is not specified, the
.Ar new-user
argument of the
.Fl l
option is used; one of
.Fl d
and
.Fl l
is needed.
.It Fl o
Allows duplicate UIDs to be given.
.It Fl p Ar password
Specifies a password encrypted with
.Xr encrypt 1
for the user.
This password can then be changed by using the
.Xr chpass 1
utility.
This value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar password
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file.
See
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5
for more details.
.It Fl S Ar secondary-group Ns Op , Ns Ar group , Ns ...
Sets the secondary groups the user will be a member of in the
.Pa /etc/group
file.
Setting
.Ar secondary-group
to an empty value (e.g. '') removes the user
from all secondary groups.
.Fl S
and
.Fl G
are mutually exclusive.
.It Fl s Ar shell
Specifies the login shell for the user.
This value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar shell
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file.
See
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5
for more details.
.It Fl U
Unlock the account by removing the trailing
.Ql \&-
from the user's shell and the
.Ql \&*
prefix from the password.
.Fl U
and
.Fl Z
are mutually exclusive and cannot be used with
.Fl p .
.It Fl u Ar uid
Specifies a new UID for the user.
Boundaries for this value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar range
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file.
See
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5
for more details.
.It Fl v
Enables verbose mode - explain the commands as they are executed.
.It Fl Z
Lock the account by appending a
.Ql \&-
to the user's shell and prefixing the password with
.Ql \&* .
.Fl Z
and
.Fl U
are mutually exclusive and cannot be used with
.Fl p .
.El
.Pp
Once the information has been verified,
.Nm
uses
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8
to update the user database.
This is run in the background and,
at very large sites, could take several minutes.
Until this update is completed, the password file is unavailable for other
updates and the new information is not available to programs.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/usermgmt.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std usermod
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chpass 1 ,
.Xr group 5 ,
.Xr passwd 5 ,
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5 ,
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8
.Sh STANDARDS
Other implementations of the
.Nm usermod
utility use the
.Ar inactive-time
parameter to refer to the maximum number of days allowed between logins (this
is used to lock "stale" accounts that have not been used for a period of time).
However, on
.Ox
systems this parameter refers instead to the password change time.
This is due to differences in the
.Xr passwd 5
database compared to other operating systems.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Ox 2.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility was written by
.An Alistair G. Crooks Aq Mt agc@NetBSD.org .
