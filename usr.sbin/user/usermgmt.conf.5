.Sh NAME
.Nm usermgmt.conf
.Nd user management tools configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm usermgmt.conf
file defines the default values used by the user management tools,
.Xr user 8 .
.Pp
Options in this file can be set by manually editing
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
or using the
.Fl D
option to
.Xr useradd 8 .
.Bl -tag -width preserveX
.It Ic base_dir
Sets the base directory name, in which new users' home directories
are created when using the
.Fl m
option to
.Xr useradd 8 .
.It Ic class
Sets the default login class for new users.
See
.Xr login.conf 5
for more information on user login classes.
.It Ic expire
Sets the default time at which the new accounts expire.
Both the
.Ar expire
and
.Ar inactive
fields should be entered in the form
.Dq month day year ,
where month is the month name (the first three characters are
sufficient), day is the day of the month, and year is the year.
Time in seconds since the Epoch (UTC) is also valid.
A value of 0 can be used to disable this feature.
.It Ic group
Sets the default primary group for new users.
If this is the special string
.Cm =uid ,
a group is created with the same numeric ID as the UID;
if such a group already exists a warning is given
and no group is created.
It has the format:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Ic group
.Ar gid | name | Cm =uid
.Ed
.It Ic inactive
Sets the default time at which the passwords of new accounts expire.
A value of 0 can be used to disable this feature.
Also see the
.Ar expire
field.
.It Ic password
Specifies a default password encrypted with
.Xr encrypt 1 .
.It Ic preserve
If this value is one of
.Ql true ,
.Ql yes ,
or a non-zero number, then the user login information will be
preserved when removing a user with
.Xr userdel 8 .
.It Ic range
Specifies the UID boundaries for new users.
If unspecified, the default is
.Dq 1000..60000 .
It has the format:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
.Ic range Ar starting-uid Ns Li .. Ns Ar ending-uid
.Ed
.It Ic shell
Sets the default login shell for new users.
.It Ic skel_dir
Sets the default skeleton directory in which to find files
with which to populate the new user's home directory.

.Xr useradd 8 ,
.Xr userdel 8 ,
.Xr usermod 8
.Sh STANDARDS
Other implementations of the
.Xr user 8
utilities use the
.Ar inactive-time
parameter to refer to the maximum number of days allowed between logins (this
is used to lock "stale" accounts that have not been used for a period of time).
However, on
.Ox
systems this parameter refers instead to the password change time.
This is due to differences in the
.Xr passwd 5
database compared to other operating systems.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
configuration file first appeared in
.Ox 2.7 .
