.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility acts as a frontend to the
.Xr useradd 8 ,
.Xr usermod 8 ,
.Xr userinfo 8 ,
and
.Xr userdel 8
commands.
.Pp
For a full explanation of the options, see the relevant manual page.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chpass 1 ,
.Xr group 5 ,
.Xr passwd 5 ,
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5 ,
.Xr useradd 8 ,
.Xr userdel 8 ,
.Xr userinfo 8 ,
.Xr usermod 8
.Sh STANDARDS
Other implementations of the
.Nm user
utilities use the
.Ar inactive-time
parameter to refer to the maximum number of days allowed between logins (this
is used to lock "stale" accounts that have not been used for a period of time).
However, on
.Ox
systems this parameter refers instead to the password change time.
This is due to differences in the
.Xr passwd 5
database compared to other operating systems.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Ox 2.7 .

The
.Nm
utility was written by
