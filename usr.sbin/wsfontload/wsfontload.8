.Sh NAME
.Nm wsfontload
.Nd load a font bitmap into a wscons display device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm wsfontload
.Bk -words
.Op Fl Bbl
.Op Fl e Ar encoding
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl h Ar height
.Op Fl N Ar name
.Op Fl w Ar width
.Op Ar fontfile
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility loads a font bitmap to a wscons device if the device driver
supports it.
The font gets assigned a name in this process which it can be referred to
by later for use on a display screen.
The font is loaded from the specified
.Ar fontfile ,
or from
.Pa stdin
if
.Ar fontfile
is not provided.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl B
Specifies that the font data is ordered right-to-left byte wise.
The default is left-to-right.
.It Fl b
Specifies that the font data is ordered right-to-left bit wise.
The default is left-to-right.
.It Fl e Ar encoding
Sets the encoding of the font.
This can be either a symbolic abbreviation or a numeric value.
Currently recognized abbreviations are
.Dq iso
for ISO 8859-1 or ISO-10646
.Pq Unicode
encoding
and
.Dq ibm
for IBM encoded fonts.
Per default,
.Dq iso
is assumed.
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify the control device of the wscons display to operate on.
Default is
.Pa /dev/ttyCcfg .
.It Fl h Ar height
Sets the height of a font character in pixels.
Default is to match the currently loaded font height for raster displays,
and 16 for text-mode VGA compatible displays.
.It Fl l
Specifies to print out a list of loaded fonts, no other
arguments should be specified.
.It Fl N Ar name
Specifies a name which can be used later to refer to the font.
If none is given, the
.Ar fontfile
name is used to create one.
.It Fl w Ar width
Sets the width of a font character in pixels.
Default is to match the currently loaded font width for raster displays,
and 8 for text-mode VGA compatible displays.
.El
.Pp
.\" Typically, the
.\" .Nm
.\" utility will be executed in system startup by the
.\" .Pa /etc/rc.wscons
.\" script, controlled by the
.\" .Pa /etc/wscons.conf
.\" configuration file.
.\" .Pp
No font files are provided with the wscons framework.
The fonts installed by PCVT can be used instead, as can raw font files from
other operating system distributions.
.Pp
A maximum of 8 fonts can be loaded.
The maximum size of a font is currently 512 KiB.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Load the IBM-encoded 8x8-font from the PCVT distribution.
This (or another 8x8-font) is necessary to use the 50-line screen type on
.Xr vga 4
displays.
