.Sh NAME
.Nm iovctl.conf
.Nd IOVCTL configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is the configuration file for the
.Xr iovctl 8
program.
This file specifies configuration parameters for a single Physical Function
.Pq PF
device.
To configure SR-IOV on multiple PF devices, use one configuration file for each
PF.
The locations of all
.Xr iovctl 9
configuration files are specified in
.Xr rc.conf 5 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
file uses UCL format.
UCL syntax is documented at the official UCL website:
http://github.com/vstakhov/libucl.
.Pp
There are three types of sections in the
.Nm
file.
A section is a key at the top level of the file with a list as its value.
The list may contain the keys specified in the
.Sx OPTIONS
section of this manual page.
Individual PF driver implementations may specify additional device-specific
configuration keys that they will accept.
The order in which sections appear in
.Nm
is ignored.
No two sections may have the same key.
For example, two sections for VF-1 must not be defined.
.Pp
The first section type is the PF section.
This section always has the key "PF"; therefore, only one such section may be
defined.
This section defines configuration parameters that apply to the PF as a whole.
.Pp
The second section type is the VF section.
This section has the key "VF-" followed by a VF index.
VF indices start at 0 and always increment by 1.
Valid VF indices are in the range of 0 to
.Pq num_vfs - 1 .
The VF index must be given as a decimal integer with no leading zeros.
This section defines configuration parameters that apply to a single VF.
.Pp
The third section type is the default section.
This section always has the key "DEFAULT"; therefore, only one such section may
be specified.
This section defines default configuration parameters that apply to all VFs.
All configuration keys that are valid to be applied to a VF are valid in this
section.
An individual VF section may override a default specified in this section by
providing a different value for the configuration parameter.
Note that the default section applies to ALL VFs.
The default section must appear before any VF sections.
The default section may appear before or after the PF section.
.Pp
The following option types are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It boolean
Accepts a boolean value of true or false.
.It mac-addr
Accepts a unicast MAC address specified as a string of the form
xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, where xx is one or two hexadecimal digits.
.It string
Accepts any string value.
.It uint8_t
Accepts any integer in the range 0 to 255, inclusive.
.It uint16_t
Accepts any integer in the range 0 to 65535, inclusive.
.It uint32_t
Accepts any integer in the range 0 to
.Pq 2**32 - 1 ,
inclusive.
.It uint64_t
Accepts any integer in the range 0 to
.Pq 2**64 - 1 ,
inclusive.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The following parameters are accepted by all PF drivers:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It device Pq string
This parameter specifies the name of the PF device.
This parameter is required to be specified.
.It num_vfs Pq uint16_t
This parameter specifies the number of VF children to create.
This parameter may not be zero.
The maximum value of this parameter is device-specific.
.El
.Pp
The following parameters are accepted by all VFs:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It passthrough Pq boolean
This parameter controls whether the VF is reserved for the use of the
.Xr bhyve 8
hypervisor as a PCI passthrough device.
If this parameter is set to true, then the VF will be reserved as a PCI
passthrough device and it will not be accessible from the host OS.
The default value of this parameter is false.
.El
.Pp
See the PF driver manual page for configuration parameters specific to
particular hardware.
.Sh EXAMPLES
This sample file will create 3 VFs as children of the ix0 device.
VF-1 and VF-2 are set as
.Xr bhyve 8
passthrough devices through the use of the default section.
VF-0 is not configured as a passthrough device as it explicitly overrides the
default.
VF-0 also sets a device-specific parameter named mac-addr.
.Bd -literal -offset ident
PF {
	device : "ix0";
	num_vfs : 3;
}

DEFAULT {
	passthrough : true;
}

VF-0 {
	mac-addr : "02:56:48:7e:d9:f7";
	passthrough : false;
}
