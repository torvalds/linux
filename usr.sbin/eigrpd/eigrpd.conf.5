.Sh NAME
.Nm eigrpd.conf
.Nd EIGRP routing daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr eigrpd 8
daemon implements the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol.
.Pp
The
.Nm
config file is divided into the following main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sx Macros
Definitions of variables that can be used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sx Global configuration
Global settings for
.Xr eigrpd 8 .
.It Sx Routing instances
Multiple routing instances can be defined.
Routing instances are defined hierarchically
by address-family and then autonomous-system.
.It Sx Interfaces configuration
Interface-specific parameters.
.El
.Pp
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore
must be quoted.
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/eigrpd.sub.conf"
.Ed
.Ss Macros
A macro is defined with a command of the form
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value .
The macro
.Ar name
can contain letters, digits, and underscores and cannot be a reserved word
(for example,
.Ic bandwidth ,
.Ic interface ,
or
.Ic hello-interval ) .
Within unquoted arguments, the string
.Pf $ Ar name
is later expanded to
.Ar value .
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
fastethernet="100000"
address-family ipv4 {
	autonomous-system 1 {
		interface em1 {
			bandwidth $fastethernet
		}
	}
}
.Ed
.Pp
The same can be accomplished by specifying the bandwidth
globally or within the address-family or autonomous-system declaration.
.Sx Global configuration
Several settings can be configured globally, per address-family, per
autonomous-system and per interface.
The only settings that can be set globally and not overruled are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic fib-priority-internal Ar prio
Set the routing priority of EIGRP internal routes to
.Ar prio .
The default is 28.
.It Ic fib-priority-external Ar prio
Set the routing priority of EIGRP external routes to
.Ar prio .
This option may be used as a simple loop-prevention mechanism when another
routing protocol is being redistributed into EIGRP.
The default is 28.
.It Ic fib-priority-summary Ar prio
Set the routing priority of EIGRP summary routes to
.Ar prio .
The default is 28.
.It Xo
.Ic fib-update
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic \&no ,
do not update the Forwarding Information Base, a.k.a. the kernel
routing table.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.It Ic rdomain Ar tableid
Specifies the routing table
.Xr eigrpd 8
should modify.
Table 0 is the default table.
.It Ic router-id Ar address
Set the router ID; if not specified, the numerically lowest IP address of
the router will be used.
.El
.Ss Routing instances
Multiple routing instances can be defined.
Routing instances are defined hierarchically
by address-family and then autonomous-system.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
address-family ipv4 {
	...
	autonomous-system 1 {
		...
		interface em0 {
			...
		}
	}
}
.Ed
.Pp
Routing-instance specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic active-timeout Ar minutes
Set the maximum time to wait before declaring a route to be in the stuck
in active state.
If 0 is given, the active timeout is disabled.
The default value is 3; valid range is 0\-65535.
.It Xo
.Ic address-family
.Pq Ic ipv4 Ns | Ns Ic ipv6
.Xc
Specify an address-family section, grouping one or more autonomous-systems.
.It Ic autonomous-system Ar number
Specify the autonomous-system, grouping one or more interfaces.
Valid range is 1\-65535.
.It Ic default-metric Ar bandwidth delay reliability load mtu
Specify a default metric for all routes redistributed into EIGRP.
Valid ranges are: 1\-10000000 for the bandwidth, 1\-16777215 for the delay,
1\-255 for the reliability, 1\-255 for the load and 1\-65535 for the mtu.
.It Ic k-values Ar K1 Ar K2 Ar K3 Ar K4 Ar K5 Ar K6
Set the coefficients used by the composite metric calculation.
Two routers become neighbors only if their K-values are the same.
For K1 and K3, The default value is 1.
For K2, K4, K5 and K6 the default value is 0;
valid range is 1\-254.
.It Ic maximum-hops Ar number
Advertise as unreachable the routes with a hop count higher than specified.
The default value is 100; valid range is 1\-255.
.It Ic maximum-paths Ar number
Specify the maximum number of ECMP paths to be installed in the FIB for
each route.
The default value is 4; valid range is 1\-32.
.It Xo

.Ic default Pc

.Op Ic metric Ar bandwidth delay reliability load mtu
.Xc
.It Xo
.Op Ic no
.Ic redistribute Ar prefix
.Op Ic metric Ar bandwidth delay reliability load mtu
.Xc
If set to
.Ic connected ,
routes to directly attached networks will be announced over EIGRP.
If set to
.Ic static ,
static routes will be announced over EIGRP.
If set to
.Ic ospf ,
OSPF routes will be announced over EIGRP.
If set to
.Ic rip ,
RIP routes will be announced over EIGRP.
If set to
.Ic default ,
a default route pointing to this router will be announced over EIGRP.
It is possible to specify a network range with
.Ar prefix ;
networks need to be part of that range to be redistributed.
By default no additional routes will be announced over EIGRP.
.Pp
.Ic redistribute
statements are evaluated in sequential order, from first to last.
The first matching rule decides if a route should be redistributed or not.
Matching rules starting with
.Ic no
will force the route to be not announced.
The only exception is
.Ic default ,
which will be set no matter what, and additionally
.Ic no
cannot be used together with it.
.Pp
It is possible to set the route
.Ic metric
for each redistribute rule.
.It Ic variance Ar multiplier
Set the variance used to permit the installation of feasible successors in the
FIB if their metric is lower than the metric of the successor multiplied by the
specified multiplier.
The default value is 1; valid range is 1\-128.
.El
.Ss Interfaces configuration
Each interface can have several parameters configured individually, otherwise
they are inherited.
Interfaces can pertain to multiple routing instances.
An interface is specified by its name.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
interface em0 {
	...
}
.Ed
.Pp
Interface-specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic bandwidth Ar bandwidth
Set the interface bandwidth in kilobits per second.
The bandwidth is used as part of the EIGRP composite metric.
The default value is 100000; valid range is 1\-10000000.
.It Ic delay Ar delay
Set the interface delay in tens of microseconds.
The delay is used as part of the EIGRP composite metric.
The default value is 10; valid range is 1\-16777215.
.It Ic hello-interval Ar seconds
Set the hello interval.
The default value is 5; valid range is 1\-65535 seconds.
.It Ic holdtime Ar seconds
Set the hello holdtime.
The default value is 15; valid range is 1\-65535 seconds.
.It Ic passive
Prevent transmission and reception of EIGRP packets on this interface.
.It Xo
.Ic split-horizon
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic \&no ,
the split horizon rule will be disabled on this interface.
This option should be used with caution since it can introduce routing loops
in point-to-point or broadcast networks.
The default is
.Ic yes .
.It Ic summary-address Ar address Ns Li / Ns Ar len
Configure a summary aggregate address for this interface.
Multiple summary addresses can be configured.
