.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm netgroup_mkdb
.Nd generate the netgroup databases
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm netgroup_mkdb
.Op Fl o Ar database
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm netgroup_mkdb
creates Berkeley databases for the specified
.Ar file .
If no file is specified,
.Pa /etc/netgroup
is used.
These databases are then installed into
.Pa /etc/netgroup.db .
The file must be in the correct format (see
.Xr netgroup 5 ) .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar database
Put the output databases in the named file.
.El
.Pp
The databases are used by the C library netgroup routines (see
.Xr getnetgrent 3 ) .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width 24n -compact
.It Pa /etc/netgroup.db
current netgroup database
.It Pa /etc/netgroup.db.tmp
a temporary file
.It Pa /etc/netgroup
current netgroup file
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std netgroup_mkdb
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr dbopen 3 ,
.Xr getnetgrent 3 ,
.Xr netgroup 5
.Sh BUGS
Because
.Nm netgroup_mkdb
guarantees not to install a partial destination file, it must
build a temporary file in the same file system and if successful use
.Xr rename 2
to install over the destination file.
.Pp
If
.Nm netgroup_mkdb
fails, it will leave the previous version of the destination file intact.
