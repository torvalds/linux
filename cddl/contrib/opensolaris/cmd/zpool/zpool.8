.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command configures
.Tn ZFS
storage pools. A storage pool is a collection of devices that provides physical
storage and data replication for
.Tn ZFS
datasets.
.Pp
All datasets within a storage pool share the same space. See
.Xr zfs 8
for information on managing datasets.
.Ss Virtual Devices (vdevs)
A
.Qq virtual device
.Pq No vdev
describes a single device or a collection of devices organized according to
certain performance and fault characteristics. The following virtual devices
are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXXXX"
.It Sy disk
A block device, typically located under
.Pa /dev .
.Tn ZFS
can use individual slices or partitions, though the recommended mode of
operation is to use whole disks. A disk can be specified by a full path to the
device or the
.Xr geom 4
provider name. When given a whole disk,
.Tn ZFS
automatically labels the disk, if necessary.
.It Sy file
A regular file. The use of files as a backing store is strongly discouraged. It
is designed primarily for experimental purposes, as the fault tolerance of a
file is only as good the file system of which it is a part. A file must be
specified by a full path.
.It Sy mirror
A mirror of two or more devices. Data is replicated in an identical fashion
across all components of a mirror. A mirror with
.Em N
disks of size
.Em X
can hold
.Em X
bytes and can withstand
.Pq Em N-1
devices failing before data integrity is compromised.
.It Sy raidz
(or
.Sy raidz1 raidz2 raidz3 ) .
A variation on
.Sy RAID-5
that allows for better distribution of parity and eliminates the
.Qq Sy RAID-5
write hole (in which data and parity become inconsistent after a power loss).
Data and parity is striped across all disks within a
.No raidz
group.
.Pp
A
.No raidz
group can have single-, double- , or triple parity, meaning that the
.No raidz
group can sustain one, two, or three failures, respectively, without
losing any data. The
.Sy raidz1 No vdev
type specifies a single-parity
.No raidz
group; the
.Sy raidz2 No vdev
type specifies a double-parity
.No raidz
group; and the
.Sy raidz3 No vdev
type specifies a triple-parity
.No raidz
group. The
.Sy raidz No vdev
type is an alias for
.Sy raidz1 .
.Pp
A
.No raidz
group with
.Em N
disks of size
.Em X
with
.Em P
parity disks can hold approximately
.Sm off
.Pq Em N-P
*X
.Sm on
bytes and can withstand
.Em P
device(s) failing before data integrity is compromised. The minimum number of
devices in a
.No raidz
group is one more than the number of parity disks. The
recommended number is between 3 and 9 to help increase performance.
.It Sy spare
A special
.No pseudo- Ns No vdev
which keeps track of available hot spares for a pool.
For more information, see the
.Qq Sx Hot Spares
section.
.It Sy log
A separate-intent log device. If more than one log device is specified, then
writes are load-balanced between devices. Log devices can be mirrored. However,
.No raidz
.No vdev
types are not supported for the intent log. For more information,
see the
.Qq Sx Intent Log
section.
.It Sy cache
A device used to cache storage pool data. A cache device cannot be configured
as a mirror or
.No raidz
group. For more information, see the
.Qq Sx Cache Devices
section.
.El
.Pp
Virtual devices cannot be nested, so a mirror or
.No raidz
virtual device can only
contain files or disks. Mirrors of mirrors (or other combinations) are not
allowed.
.Pp
A pool can have any number of virtual devices at the top of the configuration
(known as
.Qq root
.No vdev Ns s).
Data is dynamically distributed across all top-level devices to balance data
among devices. As new virtual devices are added,
.Tn ZFS
automatically places data on the newly available devices.
.Pp
Virtual devices are specified one at a time on the command line, separated by
whitespace. The keywords
.Qq mirror
and
.Qq raidz
are used to distinguish where a group ends and another begins. For example, the
following creates two root
.No vdev Ns s,
each a mirror of two disks:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Li # Ic zpool create mypool mirror da0 da1 mirror da2 da3
.Ed
.Ss Device Failure and Recovery
.Tn ZFS
supports a rich set of mechanisms for handling device failure and data
corruption. All metadata and data is checksummed, and
.Tn ZFS
automatically repairs bad data from a good copy when corruption is detected.
.Pp
In order to take advantage of these features, a pool must make use of some form
of redundancy, using either mirrored or
.No raidz
groups. While
.Tn ZFS
supports running in a non-redundant configuration, where each root
.No vdev
is simply a disk or file, this is strongly discouraged. A single case of bit
corruption can render some or all of your data unavailable.
.Pp
A pool's health status is described by one of three states: online, degraded,
or faulted. An online pool has all devices operating normally. A degraded pool
is one in which one or more devices have failed, but the data is still
available due to a redundant configuration. A faulted pool has corrupted
metadata, or one or more faulted devices, and insufficient replicas to continue
functioning.
.Pp
The health of the top-level
.No vdev ,
such as mirror or
.No raidz
device, is
potentially impacted by the state of its associated
.No vdev Ns s,
or component devices. A top-level
.No vdev
or component device is in one of the following states:
.Bl -tag -width "DEGRADED"
.It Sy DEGRADED
One or more top-level
.No vdev Ns s
is in the degraded state because one or more
component devices are offline. Sufficient replicas exist to continue
functioning.
.Pp
One or more component devices is in the degraded or faulted state, but
sufficient replicas exist to continue functioning. The underlying conditions
are as follows:
.Bl -bullet -offset 2n
.It
The number of checksum errors exceeds acceptable levels and the device is
degraded as an indication that something may be wrong.
.Tn ZFS
continues to use the device as necessary.
.It
The number of
.Tn I/O
errors exceeds acceptable levels. The device could not be
marked as faulted because there are insufficient replicas to continue
functioning.
.El
.It Sy FAULTED
One or more top-level
.No vdev Ns s
is in the faulted state because one or more
component devices are offline. Insufficient replicas exist to continue
functioning.
.Pp
One or more component devices is in the faulted state, and insufficient
replicas exist to continue functioning. The underlying conditions are as
follows:
.Bl -bullet -offset 2n
.It
The device could be opened, but the contents did not match expected values.
.It
The number of
.Tn I/O
errors exceeds acceptable levels and the device is faulted to
prevent further use of the device.
.El
.It Sy OFFLINE
The device was explicitly taken offline by the
.Qq Nm Cm offline
command.
.It Sy ONLINE
The device is online and functioning.
.It Sy REMOVED
The device was physically removed while the system was running. Device removal
detection is hardware-dependent and may not be supported on all platforms.
.It Sy UNAVAIL
The device could not be opened. If a pool is imported when a device was
unavailable, then the device will be identified by a unique identifier instead
of its path since the path was never correct in the first place.
.El
.Pp
If a device is removed and later reattached to the system,
.Tn ZFS
attempts to put the device online automatically. Device attach detection is
hardware-dependent and might not be supported on all platforms.
.Ss Hot Spares
.Tn ZFS
allows devices to be associated with pools as
.Qq hot spares .
These devices are not actively used in the pool, but when an active device
fails, it is automatically replaced by a hot spare. To create a pool with hot
spares, specify a
.Qq spare
.No vdev
with any number of devices. For example,
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Li # Ic zpool create pool mirror da0 da1 spare da2 da3
.Ed
.Pp
Spares can be shared across multiple pools, and can be added with the
.Qq Nm Cm add
command and removed with the
.Qq Nm Cm remove
command. Once a spare replacement is initiated, a new "spare"
.No vdev
is created
within the configuration that will remain there until the original device is
replaced. At this point, the hot spare becomes available again if another
device fails.
.Pp
If a pool has a shared spare that is currently being used, the pool can not be
exported since other pools may use this shared spare, which may lead to
potential data corruption.
.Pp
An in-progress spare replacement can be cancelled by detaching the hot spare.
If the original faulted device is detached, then the hot spare assumes its
place in the configuration, and is removed from the spare list of all active
pools.
.Pp
Spares cannot replace log devices.
.Pp
This feature requires a userland helper.
FreeBSD provides
.Xr zfsd 8
for this purpose.
It must be manually enabled by adding
.Va zfsd_enable="YES"
to
.Pa /etc/rc.conf .
.Ss Intent Log
The
.Tn ZFS
Intent Log
.Pq Tn ZIL
satisfies
.Tn POSIX
requirements for synchronous transactions. For instance, databases often
require their transactions to be on stable storage devices when returning from
a system call.
.Tn NFS
and other applications can also use
.Xr fsync 2
to ensure data stability. By default, the intent log is allocated from blocks
within the main pool. However, it might be possible to get better performance
using separate intent log devices such as
.Tn NVRAM
or a dedicated disk. For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Li # Ic zpool create pool da0 da1 log da2
.Ed
.Pp
Multiple log devices can also be specified, and they can be mirrored. See the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section for an example of mirroring multiple log devices.
.Pp
Log devices can be added, replaced, attached, detached, imported and exported
as part of the larger pool.
Mirrored devices can be removed by specifying the top-level mirror vdev.
.Ss Cache devices
Devices can be added to a storage pool as "cache devices." These devices
provide an additional layer of caching between main memory and disk. For
read-heavy workloads, where the working set size is much larger than what can
be cached in main memory, using cache devices allow much more of this working
set to be served from low latency media. Using cache devices provides the
greatest performance improvement for random read-workloads of mostly static
content.
.Pp
To create a pool with cache devices, specify a "cache"
.No vdev
with any number of devices. For example:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
.Li # Ic zpool create pool da0 da1 cache da2 da3
.Ed
.Pp
Cache devices cannot be mirrored or part of a
.No raidz
configuration. If a read
error is encountered on a cache device, that read
.Tn I/O
is reissued to the original storage pool device, which might be part of a
mirrored or
.No raidz
configuration.
.Pp
The content of the cache devices is considered volatile, as is the case with
other system caches.
.Ss Pool checkpoint
Before starting critical procedures that include destructive actions (e.g
.Nm zfs Cm destroy
), an administrator can checkpoint the pool's state and in the case of a
mistake or failure, rewind the entire pool back to the checkpoint.
Otherwise, the checkpoint can be discarded when the procedure has completed
successfully.
.Pp
A pool checkpoint can be thought of as a pool-wide snapshot and should be used
with care as it contains every part of the pool's state, from properties to vdev
configuration.
Thus, while a pool has a checkpoint certain operations are not allowed.
Specifically, vdev removal/attach/detach, mirror splitting, and
changing the pool's guid.
Adding a new vdev is supported but in the case of a rewind it will have to be
added again.
Finally, users of this feature should keep in mind that scrubs in a pool that
has a checkpoint do not repair checkpointed data.
.Pp
To create a checkpoint for a pool:
.Bd -literal
# zpool checkpoint pool
.Ed
.Pp
To later rewind to its checkpointed state, you need to first export it and
then rewind it during import:
.Bd -literal
# zpool export pool
# zpool import --rewind-to-checkpoint pool
.Ed
.Pp
To discard the checkpoint from a pool:
.Bd -literal
# zpool checkpoint -d pool
.Ed
.Pp
Dataset reservations (controlled by the
.Nm reservation
or
.Nm refreservation
zfs properties) may be unenforceable while a checkpoint exists, because the
checkpoint is allowed to consume the dataset's reservation.
Finally, data that is part of the checkpoint but has been freed in the
current state of the pool won't be scanned during a scrub.
.Ss Properties
Each pool has several properties associated with it. Some properties are
read-only statistics while others are configurable and change the behavior of
the pool. The following are read-only properties:
.Bl -tag -width "dedupratio"
.It Sy alloc
Amount of storage space within the pool that has been physically allocated.
.It Sy capacity
Percentage of pool space used. This property can also be referred to by its
shortened column name, "cap".
.It Sy comment
A text string consisting of printable ASCII characters that will be stored
such that it is available even if the pool becomes faulted.  An administrator
can provide additional information about a pool using this property.
.It Sy dedupratio
The deduplication ratio specified for a pool, expressed as a multiplier.
For example, a
.Sy dedupratio
value of 1.76 indicates that 1.76 units of data were stored but only 1 unit of disk space was actually consumed. See
.Xr zfs 8
for a description of the deduplication feature.
.It Sy expandsize
Amount of uninitialized space within the pool or device that can be used to
increase the total capacity of the pool.
Uninitialized space consists of
any space on an EFI labeled vdev which has not been brought online
.Pq i.e. zpool online -e .
This space occurs when a LUN is dynamically expanded.
.It Sy fragmentation
The amount of fragmentation in the pool.
.It Sy free
Number of blocks within the pool that are not allocated.
.It Sy freeing
After a file system or snapshot is destroyed, the space it was using is
returned to the pool asynchronously.
.Sy freeing
is the amount of space remaining to be reclaimed.
Over time
.Sy freeing
will decrease while
.Sy free
increases.
.It Sy guid
A unique identifier for the pool.
.It Sy health
The current health of the pool. Health can be
.Qq Sy ONLINE ,
.Qq Sy DEGRADED ,
.Qq Sy FAULTED ,
.Qq Sy OFFLINE ,
.Qq Sy REMOVED ,
or
.Qq Sy UNAVAIL .
.It Sy size
Total size of the storage pool.
.It Sy unsupported@ Ns Ar feature_guid
Information about unsupported features that are enabled on the pool.
See
.Xr zpool-features 7
for details.
.It Sy used
Amount of storage space used within the pool.
.El
.Pp
The space usage properties report actual physical space available to the
storage pool. The physical space can be different from the total amount of
space that any contained datasets can actually use. The amount of space used in
a
.No raidz
configuration depends on the characteristics of the data being written.
In addition,
.Tn ZFS
reserves some space for internal accounting that the
.Xr zfs 8
command takes into account, but the
.Xr zpool 8
command does not. For non-full pools of a reasonable size, these effects should
be invisible. For small pools, or pools that are close to being completely
full, these discrepancies may become more noticeable.
.Pp
The following property can be set at creation time and import time:
.Bl -tag -width 2n
.It Sy altroot
Alternate root directory. If set, this directory is prepended to any mount
points within the pool. This can be used when examining an unknown pool where
the mount points cannot be trusted, or in an alternate boot environment, where
the typical paths are not valid.
.Sy altroot
is not a persistent property. It is valid only while the system is up.
Setting
.Sy altroot
defaults to using
.Cm cachefile=none ,
though this may be overridden using an explicit setting.
.El
.Pp
The following property can only be set at import time:
.Bl -tag -width 2n
.It Sy readonly Ns = Ns Cm on No | Cm off
If set to
.Cm on ,
pool will be imported in read-only mode with the following restrictions:
.Bl -bullet -offset 2n
.It
Synchronous data in the intent log will not be accessible
.It
Properties of the pool can not be changed
.It
Datasets of this pool can only be mounted read-only
.It
To write to a read-only pool, a export and import of the pool is required.
.El
.Pp
This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
.Sy rdonly .
.El
.Pp
The following properties can be set at creation time and import time, and later
changed with the
.Ic zpool set
command:
.Bl -tag -width 2n
.It Sy autoexpand Ns = Ns Cm on No | Cm off
Controls automatic pool expansion when the underlying LUN is grown. If set to
.Qq Cm on ,
the pool will be resized according to the size of the expanded
device. If the device is part of a mirror or
.No raidz
then all devices within that
.No mirror/ Ns No raidz
group must be expanded before the new space is made available to
the pool. The default behavior is
.Qq off .
This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
.Sy expand .
.It Sy autoreplace Ns = Ns Cm on No | Cm off
Controls automatic device replacement. If set to
.Qq Cm off ,
device replacement must be initiated by the administrator by using the
.Qq Nm Cm replace
command. If set to
.Qq Cm on ,
any new device, found in the same
physical location as a device that previously belonged to the pool, is
automatically formatted and replaced. The default behavior is
.Qq Cm off .
This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, "replace".
.It Sy bootfs Ns = Ns Ar pool Ns / Ns Ar dataset
Identifies the default bootable dataset for the root pool. This property is
expected to be set mainly by the installation and upgrade programs.
.It Sy cachefile Ns = Ns Ar path No | Cm none
Controls the location of where the pool configuration is cached. Discovering
all pools on system startup requires a cached copy of the configuration data
that is stored on the root file system. All pools in this cache are
automatically imported when the system boots. Some environments, such as
install and clustering, need to cache this information in a different location
so that pools are not automatically imported. Setting this property caches the
pool configuration in a different location that can later be imported with
.Qq Nm Cm import Fl c .
Setting it to the special value
.Qq Cm none
creates a temporary pool that is never cached, and the special value
.Cm ''
(empty string) uses the default location.
.It Sy comment Ns = Ns Ar text
A text string consisting of printable ASCII characters that will be stored
such that it is available even if the pool becomes faulted.
An administrator can provide additional information about a pool using this
property.
.It Sy dedupditto Ns = Ns Ar number
Threshold for the number of block ditto copies. If the reference count for a
deduplicated block increases above this number, a new ditto copy of this block
is automatically stored. Default setting is
.Cm 0
which causes no ditto copies to be created for deduplicated blocks.
The miniumum legal nonzero setting is 100.
.It Sy delegation Ns = Ns Cm on No | Cm off
Controls whether a non-privileged user is granted access based on the dataset
permissions defined on the dataset. See
.Xr zfs 8
for more information on
.Tn ZFS
delegated administration.
.It Sy failmode Ns = Ns Cm wait No | Cm continue No | Cm panic
Controls the system behavior in the event of catastrophic pool failure. This
condition is typically a result of a loss of connectivity to the underlying
storage device(s) or a failure of all devices within the pool. The behavior of
such an event is determined as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy wait
Blocks all
.Tn I/O
access until the device connectivity is recovered and the errors are cleared.
This is the default behavior.
.It Sy continue
Returns
.Em EIO
to any new write
.Tn I/O
requests but allows reads to any of the remaining healthy devices. Any write
requests that have yet to be committed to disk would be blocked.
.It Sy panic
Prints out a message to the console and generates a system crash dump.
.El
.It Sy feature@ Ns Ar feature_name Ns = Ns Sy enabled
The value of this property is the current state of
.Ar feature_name .
The only valid value when setting this property is
.Sy enabled
which moves
.Ar feature_name
to the enabled state.
See
.Xr zpool-features 7
for details on feature states.
.It Sy listsnaps Ns = Ns Cm on No | Cm off
Controls whether information about snapshots associated with this pool is
output when
.Qq Nm zfs Cm list
is run without the
.Fl t
option. The default value is
.Cm off .
.It Sy version Ns = Ns Ar version
The current on-disk version of the pool. This can be increased, but never
decreased. The preferred method of updating pools is with the
.Qq Nm Cm upgrade
command, though this property can be used when a specific version is needed
for backwards compatibility.
Once feature flags is enabled on a pool this property will no longer have a
value.
.El
.Sh SUBCOMMANDS
All subcommands that modify state are logged persistently to the pool in their
original form.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command provides subcommands to create and destroy storage pools, add capacity
to storage pools, and provide information about the storage pools. The following
subcommands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width 2n
.It Xo
.Nm
.Op Fl \&?
.Xc
.Pp
Displays a help message.
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm add
.Op Fl fn
.Ar pool vdev ...
.Xc
.Pp
Adds the specified virtual devices to the given pool. The
.No vdev
specification is described in the
.Qq Sx Virtual Devices
section. The behavior of the
.Fl f
option, and the device checks performed are described in the
.Qq Nm Cm create
subcommand.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
Forces use of
.Ar vdev ,
even if they appear in use or specify a conflicting replication level.
Not all devices can be overridden in this manner.
.It Fl n
Displays the configuration that would be used without actually adding the
.Ar vdev Ns s.
The actual pool creation can still fail due to insufficient privileges or device
sharing.
.Pp
Do not add a disk that is currently configured as a quorum device to a zpool.
After a disk is in the pool, that disk can then be configured as a quorum
device.
.El
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm attach
.Op Fl f
.Ar pool device new_device
.Xc
.Pp
Attaches
.Ar new_device
to an existing
.Sy zpool
device. The existing device cannot be part of a
.No raidz
configuration. If
.Ar device
is not currently part of a mirrored configuration,
.Ar device
automatically transforms into a two-way mirror of
.Ar device No and Ar new_device .
If
.Ar device
is part of a two-way mirror, attaching
.Ar new_device
creates a three-way mirror, and so on. In either case,
.Ar new_device
begins to resilver immediately.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
Forces use of
.Ar new_device ,
even if its appears to be in use. Not all devices can be overridden in this
manner.
.El
.It Xo
.Nm
.Cm checkpoint
.Op Fl d, -discard
.Ar pool
.Xc
Checkpoints the current state of

.Nm zpool Cm import --rewind-to-checkpoint .
The existence of a checkpoint in a pool prohibits the following
.Nm zpool
commands:
.Cm remove ,
.Cm attach ,
.Cm detach ,
.Cm split ,
and
.Cm reguid .
In addition, it may break reservation boundaries if the pool lacks free
space.
The
.Nm zpool Cm status
command indicates the existence of a checkpoint or the progress of discarding a
checkpoint from a pool.
The
.Nm zpool Cm list
command reports how much space the checkpoint takes from the pool.

those errors associated with the specified device or devices are cleared.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl F
Initiates recovery mode for an unopenable pool. Attempts to discard the last
few transactions in the pool to return it to an openable state. Not all damaged
pools can be recovered by using this option. If successful, the data from the
discarded transactions is irretrievably lost.

.Pp
Creates a new storage pool containing the virtual devices specified on the
command line. The pool name must begin with a letter, and can only contain
alphanumeric characters as well as underscore ("_"), dash ("-"), and period
("."). The pool names "mirror", "raidz", "spare" and "log" are reserved, as are
names beginning with the pattern "c[0-9]". The
.No vdev
specification is described in the
.Qq Sx Virtual Devices
section.
.Pp
The command verifies that each device specified is accessible and not currently
in use by another subsystem. There are some uses, such as being currently
mounted, or specified as the dedicated dump device, that prevents a device from
ever being used by
.Tn ZFS
Other uses, such as having a preexisting
.Sy UFS
file system, can be overridden with the
.Fl f
option.
.Pp
The command also checks that the replication strategy for the pool is
consistent. An attempt to combine redundant and non-redundant storage in a
single pool, or to mix disks and files, results in an error unless
.Fl f
is specified. The use of differently sized devices within a single
.No raidz
or mirror group is also flagged as an error unless
.Fl f
is specified.
.Pp
Unless the
.Fl R
option is specified, the default mount point is
.Qq Pa /pool .
The mount point must not exist or must be empty, or else the
root dataset cannot be mounted. This can be overridden with the
.Fl m
option.
.Pp
By default all supported features are enabled on the new pool unless the
.Fl d
option is specified.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
Forces use of

even if they appear in use or specify a conflicting replication level.
Not all devices can be overridden in this manner.
.It Fl n
Displays the configuration that would be used without actually creating the
pool. The actual pool creation can still fail due to insufficient privileges or
device sharing.
.It Fl d
Do not enable any features on the new pool.
Individual features can be enabled by setting their corresponding properties

sufficient number of devices are present.
.Pp
Before exporting the pool, all datasets within the pool are unmounted. A pool
can not be exported if it has a shared spare that is currently being used.
.Pp
For pools to be portable, you must give the

Removing a top-level vdev reduces the total amount of space in the storage pool.
The specified device will be evacuated by copying all allocated space from it to

.Pp
Begins a scrub or resumes a paused scrub.
The scrub examines all data in the specified pools to verify that it checksums
correctly.
For replicated
.Pq mirror or raidz
devices, ZFS automatically repairs any damage discovered during the scrub.
The
.Nm zpool Cm status
command reports the progress of the scrub and summarizes the results of the
scrub upon completion.
.Pp
Scrubbing and resilvering are very similar operations.
The difference is that resilvering only examines data that ZFS knows to be out
of date
.Po
for example, when attaching a new device to a mirror or replacing an existing
device
.Pc ,
whereas scrubbing examines all data to discover silent errors due to hardware
faults or disk failure.
.Pp
Because scrubbing and resilvering are I/O-intensive operations, ZFS only allows
one at a time.
If a scrub is paused, the
.Nm zpool Cm scrub
resumes it.
If a resilver is in progress, ZFS does not allow a scrub to be started until the
resilver completes.
