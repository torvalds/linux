The PMSWINC_EL0 register is a manually updated counter for use by application software.\n\nThis event could be used to measure any user program event, such as accesses to a particular data structure (by writing to the PMSWINC_EL0 register each time the data structure is accessed).\n\nTo use the PMSWINC_EL0 register and event, developers must insert instructions that write to the PMSWINC_EL0 register into the source code.\n\nSince the SW_INCR event records writes to the PMSWINC_EL0 register, there is no need to do a read/increment/write sequence to the PMSWINC_EL0 register."
