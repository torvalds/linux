	  Some of the various things that Linux supports (such as network
	  drivers, file systems, network protocols, etc.) can be in a state
	  of development where the functionality, stability, or the level of
	  testing is not yet high enough for general use. This is usually
	  known as the "alpha-test" phase among developers. If a feature is
	  currently in alpha-test, then the developers usually discourage
	  uninformed widespread use of this feature by the general public to
	  avoid "Why doesn't this work?" type mail messages. However, active
	  testing and use of these systems is welcomed. Just be aware that it
	  may not meet the normal level of reliability or it may fail to work
	  in some special cases. Detailed bug reports from people familiar
	  with the kernel internals are usually welcomed by the developers
	  (before submitting bug reports, please read the documents
	  <file:README>, <file:MAINTAINERS>, <file:REPORTING-BUGS>,
	  <file:Documentation/BUG-HUNTING>, and
	  <file:Documentation/oops-tracing.txt> in the kernel source).

	  This option will also make obsoleted drivers available. These are
	  drivers that have been replaced by something else, and/or are
	  scheduled to be removed in a future kernel release.

	  Unless you intend to help test and develop a feature or driver that
	  falls into this category, or you have a situation that requires
	  using these features, you should probably say N here, which will

	help
	  This option allows you to force a module to unload, even if the
	  kernel believes it is unsafe: the kernel will remove the module
	  without waiting for anyone to stop using it (using the -f option to
	  rmmod).  This is mainly for kernel developers and desperate users.
	  If unsure, say N.

config MODVERSIONS
	bool "Module versioning support"
	help
	  Usually, you have to use modules compiled with your kernel.
	  Saying Y here makes it sometimes possible to use modules
	  compiled for different kernels, by adding enough information
	  to the modules to (hopefully) spot any changes which would
	  make them incompatible with the kernel you are running.  If
	  unsure, say N.

config MODULE_SRCVERSION_ALL
	bool "Source checksum for all modules"
	help
	  Modules which contain a MODULE_VERSION get an extra "srcversion"
	  field inserted into their modinfo section, which contains a
    	  sum of the source files which made it.  This helps maintainers
	  see exactly which source was used to build a module (since
	  others sometimes change the module source without updating
	  the version).  With this option, such a "srcversion" field
	  will be created for all modules.  If unsure, say N.

config INIT_ALL_POSSIBLE
	bool
	help
	  Back when each arch used to define their own cpu_online_mask and
	  cpu_possible_mask, some of them chose to initialize cpu_possible_mask
	  with all 1s, and others with all 0s.  When they were centralised,
	  it was better to provide this option than to break all the archs
	  and have several arch maintainers pursuing me down dark alleys.
