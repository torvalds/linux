	  This option allows to increase the default ring buffer size

	  of each CPU as a power of 2. The used space is typically only few
	  lines however it might be much more when problems are reported,
	  e.g. backtraces.

	  The increased size means that a new buffer has to be allocated and
	  the original static one is unused. It makes sense only on systems
	  with more CPUs. Therefore this value is used only when the sum of
	  contributions is greater than the half of the default kernel ring
	  buffer as defined by LOG_BUF_SHIFT. The default values are set
	  so that more than 16 CPUs are needed to trigger the allocation.

	  Also this option is ignored when "log_buf_len" kernel parameter is
	  used as it forces an exact (power of two) size of the ring buffer.

	  The number of possible CPUs is used for this computation ignoring
	  hotplugging making the computation optimal for the worst case
	  scenario while allowing a simple algorithm to be used from bootup.

	  defines the minimum frequency it should use.

	  will be SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE/UCLAMP_BUCKETS_COUNT. The higher the
	  number of clamp buckets the finer their granularity and the higher
	  the precision of clamping aggregation and tracking at run-time.

	  For example, with the minimum configuration value we will have 5
	  clamp buckets tracking 20% utilization each. A 25% boosted tasks will
	  be refcounted in the [20..39]% bucket and will set the bucket clamp
	  effective value to 25%.
	  If a second 30% boosted task should be co-scheduled on the same CPU,
	  that task will be refcounted in the same bucket of the first task and
	  it will boost the bucket clamp effective value to 30%.
	  The clamp effective value of a bucket is reset to its nominal value
	  (20% in the example above) when there are no more tasks refcounted in
	  that bucket.

	  An additional boost/capping margin can be added to some tasks. In the
	  example above the 25% task will be boosted to 30% until it exits the
	  CPU. If that should be considered not acceptable on certain systems,
	  it's always possible to reduce the margin by increasing the number of
	  clamp buckets to trade off used memory for run-time tracking
	  precision.

	  If in doubt, use the default value.

	  It should be noted that organisational operations (such as attaching

	  silently broken kernel if the required annotations are not
	  present. This option is not well tested yet, so use at your

	  This option enables normal printk support. Removing it

	  The shmem is an internal filesystem used to manage shared memory.
	  It is backed by swap and manages resource limits. It is also exported

config AIO

	  This option enables the madvise and fadvise syscalls, used by

config MEMBARRIER

config KALLSYMS

	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to let the kernel print out symbolic crash information and

	  somewhat, as all symbols have to be loaded into the kernel image.

config KALLSYMS_ALL
	bool "Include all symbols in kallsyms"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && KALLSYMS
	help
	  Normally kallsyms only contains the symbols of functions for nicer
	  OOPS messages and backtraces (i.e., symbols from the text and inittext
	  sections). This is sufficient for most cases. And only if you want to
	  enable kernel live patching, or other less common use cases (e.g.,
	  when a debugger is used) all symbols are required (i.e., names of
	  variables from the data sections, etc).

	  This option makes sure that all symbols are loaded into the kernel
	  image (i.e., symbols from all sections) in cost of increased kernel
	  size (depending on the kernel configuration, it may be 300KiB or
	  something like this).

	  Say N unless you really need all symbols, or kernel live patching.

	  Instead of emitting them as absolute values in the native word size,
	  emit the symbol references in the kallsyms table as 32-bit entries,
	  each containing a relative value in the range [base, base + U32_MAX]
	  or, when KALLSYMS_ABSOLUTE_PERCPU is in effect, each containing either
	  an absolute value in the range [0, S32_MAX] or a relative value in the
	  range [base, base + S32_MAX], where base is the lowest relative symbol
	  address encountered in the image.

	  On 64-bit builds, this reduces the size of the address table by 50%,
	  but more importantly, it results in entries whose values are build
	  time constants, and no relocation pass is required at runtime to fix
	  up the entries based on the runtime load address of the kernel.

	help
	  Enable kernel support for various performance events provided
	  by software and hardware.

	  Software events are supported either built-in or via the
	  use of generic tracepoints.

	  Most modern CPUs support performance events via performance
	  counter registers. These registers count the number of certain
	  types of hw events: such as instructions executed, cachemisses
	  suffered, or branches mis-predicted - without slowing down the
	  kernel or applications. These registers can also trigger interrupts
	  when a threshold number of events have passed - and can thus be
	  used to profile the code that runs on that CPU.

	  The Linux Performance Event subsystem provides an abstraction of
	  these software and hardware event capabilities, available via a
	  system call and used by the "perf" utility in tools/perf/. It
	  provides per task and per CPU counters, and it provides event
	  capabilities on top of those.
