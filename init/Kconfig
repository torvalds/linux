	  the precision of clamping aggregation and tracking at run-time.

	  For example, with the minimum configuration value we will have 5
	  clamp buckets tracking 20% utilization each. A 25% boosted tasks will
	  be refcounted in the [20..39]% bucket and will set the bucket clamp
	  effective value to 25%.
	  If a second 30% boosted task should be co-scheduled on the same CPU,
	  that task will be refcounted in the same bucket of the first task and
	  it will boost the bucket clamp effective value to 30%.
	  The clamp effective value of a bucket is reset to its nominal value
	  (20% in the example above) when there are no more tasks refcounted in
	  that bucket.

	  An additional boost/capping margin can be added to some tasks. In the
	  example above the 25% task will be boosted to 30% until it exits the
	  CPU. If that should be considered not acceptable on certain systems,
	  it's always possible to reduce the margin by increasing the number of
	  clamp buckets to trade off used memory for run-time tracking
	  precision.

	  If in doubt, use the default value.

	  It should be noted that organisational operations (such as attaching

	  Software events are supported either built-in or via the

	  Most modern CPUs support performance events via performance
	  counter registers. These registers count the number of certain

	  kernel or applications. These registers can also trigger interrupts
	  when a threshold number of events have passed - and can thus be
	  used to profile the code that runs on that CPU.

	  The Linux Performance Event subsystem provides an abstraction of
	  these software and hardware event capabilities, available via a

	  While the randomization improves cache utilization it may
	  negatively impact workloads on platforms without a cache. For
	  this reason, by default, the randomization is enabled only

	  providing a huge performance boost.  If this option is not enabled,
	  then the flag will be ignored.

	  This is taken advantage of by uClibc's malloc(), and also by
	  ELF-FDPIC binfmt's brk and stack allocator.

	  Because of the obvious security issues, this option should only be
