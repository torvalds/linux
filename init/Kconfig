	  testing is not yet high enough for general use. This is usually
	  known as the "alpha-test" phase among developers. If a feature is
	  currently in alpha-test, then the developers usually discourage
	  uninformed widespread use of this feature by the general public to
	  avoid "Why doesn't this work?" type mail messages. However, active
	  testing and use of these systems is welcomed. Just be aware that it
	  may not meet the normal level of reliability or it may fail to work
	  in some special cases. Detailed bug reports from people familiar
	  with the kernel internals are usually welcomed by the developers
	  (before submitting bug reports, please read the documents

	 default y
	 help
	   Say Y here to let the kernel print out symbolic crash information and
	   symbolic stack backtraces. This increases the size of the kernel
	   somewhat, as all symbols have to be loaded into the kernel image.

config KALLSYMS_ALL
	bool "Include all symbols in kallsyms"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && KALLSYMS
	help
	   Normally kallsyms only contains the symbols of functions, for nicer
	   OOPS messages.  Some debuggers can use kallsyms for other
	   symbols too: say Y here to include all symbols, if you need them 
	   and you don't care about adding 300k to the size of your kernel.

	   Say N.

config KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS
	bool "Do an extra kallsyms pass"
	depends on KALLSYMS
	help
	   If kallsyms is not working correctly, the build will fail with
	   inconsistent kallsyms data.  If that occurs, log a bug report and
	   turn on KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS which should result in a stable build.
	   Always say N here unless you find a bug in kallsyms, which must be
	   reported.  KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS is only a temporary workaround while
	   you wait for kallsyms to be fixed.


config HOTPLUG
	bool "Support for hot-pluggable devices" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	help
	  This option is provided for the case where no hotplug or uevent
	  capabilities is wanted by the kernel.  You should only consider
	  disabling this option for embedded systems that do not use modules, a
	  dynamic /dev tree, or dynamic device discovery.  Just say Y.

config PRINTK
	default y
	bool "Enable support for printk" if EMBEDDED
	help
	  This option enables normal printk support. Removing it
	  eliminates most of the message strings from the kernel image
	  and makes the kernel more or less silent. As this makes it
	  very difficult to diagnose system problems, saying N here is
	  strongly discouraged.

config BUG
	bool "BUG() support" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	help
          Disabling this option eliminates support for BUG and WARN, reducing
          the size of your kernel image and potentially quietly ignoring
          numerous fatal conditions. You should only consider disabling this
          option for embedded systems with no facilities for reporting errors.
          Just say Y.

config ELF_CORE
	default y
	bool "Enable ELF core dumps" if EMBEDDED

	  Enable support for generating core dumps. Disabling saves about 4k.

config PCSPKR_PLATFORM
	bool "Enable PC-Speaker support" if EMBEDDED
	depends on ALPHA || X86 || MIPS || PPC_PREP || PPC_CHRP || PPC_PSERIES
	default y
	help
          This option allows to disable the internal PC-Speaker
          support, saving some memory.

config BASE_FULL
	default y
	bool "Enable full-sized data structures for core" if EMBEDDED
	help
	  Disabling this option reduces the size of miscellaneous core
	  kernel data structures. This saves memory on small machines,
	  but may reduce performance.

config FUTEX
	bool "Enable futex support" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	select RT_MUTEXES
	help
	  Disabling this option will cause the kernel to be built without
	  support for "fast userspace mutexes".  The resulting kernel may not
	  run glibc-based applications correctly.

config EPOLL
	bool "Enable eventpoll support" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	select ANON_INODES
	help
	  Disabling this option will cause the kernel to be built without
	  support for epoll family of system calls.

config SIGNALFD

	  Enable the eventfd() system call that allows to receive both
	  kernel notification (ie. KAIO) or userspace notifications.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config SHMEM
	bool "Use full shmem filesystem" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	depends on MMU
	help
	  The shmem is an internal filesystem used to manage shared memory.
	  It is backed by swap and manages resource limits. It is also exported
	  to userspace as tmpfs if TMPFS is enabled. Disabling this
	  option replaces shmem and tmpfs with the much simpler ramfs code,
	  which may be appropriate on small systems without swap.

config AIO
	bool "Enable AIO support" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	help
	  This option enables POSIX asynchronous I/O which may by used
          by some high performance threaded applications. Disabling

config PERF_EVENTS
	bool "Kernel performance events and counters"
	default y if (PROFILING || PERF_COUNTERS)
	depends on HAVE_PERF_EVENTS
	select ANON_INODES
	help
	  Enable kernel support for various performance events provided
	  by software and hardware.

	  Software events are supported either build-in or via the
	  use of generic tracepoints.

	  Most modern CPUs support performance events via performance
	  counter registers. These registers count the number of certain
	  types of hw events: such as instructions executed, cachemisses
	  suffered, or branches mis-predicted - without slowing down the
	  kernel or applications. These registers can also trigger interrupts
	  when a threshold number of events have passed - and can thus be
	  used to profile the code that runs on that CPU.

	  The Linux Performance Event subsystem provides an abstraction of
	  these software and hardware cevent apabilities, available via a
	  system call and used by the "perf" utility in tools/perf/. It
	  provides per task and per CPU counters, and it provides event
	  capabilities on top of those.

	  Say Y if unsure.

config EVENT_PROFILE
	bool "Tracepoint profiling sources"
	depends on PERF_EVENTS && EVENT_TRACING
	default y
	help
	 Allow the use of tracepoints as software performance events.

	 When this is enabled, you can create perf events based on
	 tracepoints using PERF_TYPE_TRACEPOINT and the tracepoint ID
	 found in debugfs://tracing/events/*/*/id. (The -e/--events
	 option to the perf tool can parse and interpret symbolic
	 tracepoints, in the subsystem:tracepoint_name format.)

config PERF_COUNTERS
	bool "Kernel performance counters (old config option)"
	depends on HAVE_PERF_EVENTS
	help
	  This config has been obsoleted by the PERF_EVENTS
	  config option - please see that one for details.

	  It has no effect on the kernel whether you enable
	  it or not, it is a compatibility placeholder.

	  Say N if unsure.

config VM_EVENT_COUNTERS
	default y
	bool "Enable VM event counters for /proc/vmstat" if EMBEDDED
	help
	  VM event counters are needed for event counts to be shown.
	  This option allows the disabling of the VM event counters
	  on EMBEDDED systems.  /proc/vmstat will only show page counts
	  if VM event counters are disabled.

config PCI_QUIRKS
	default y
	bool "Enable PCI quirk workarounds" if EMBEDDED
	depends on PCI
	help
	  This enables workarounds for various PCI chipset
          bugs/quirks. Disable this only if your target machine is
          unaffected by PCI quirks.

config SLUB_DEBUG
	default y
	bool "Enable SLUB debugging support" if EMBEDDED
	depends on SLUB && SYSFS
	help
	  SLUB has extensive debug support features. Disabling these can
	  result in significant savings in code size. This also disables
	  SLUB sysfs support. /sys/slab will not exist and there will be
	  no support for cache validation etc.

config COMPAT_BRK
	bool "Disable heap randomization"
	default y
	help
	  Randomizing heap placement makes heap exploits harder, but it
	  also breaks ancient binaries (including anything libc5 based).
	  This option changes the bootup default to heap randomization
	  disabled, and can be overridden at runtime by setting
	  /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space to 2.

	  On non-ancient distros (post-2000 ones) N is usually a safe choice.

choice
	prompt "Choose SLAB allocator"

	help
	   This option allows to select a slab allocator.

config SLAB
	bool "SLAB"
	help
	  The regular slab allocator that is established and known to work
	  well in all environments. It organizes cache hot objects in
	  per cpu and per node queues.

config SLUB
	bool "SLUB (Unqueued Allocator)"
	help
	   SLUB is a slab allocator that minimizes cache line usage
	   instead of managing queues of cached objects (SLAB approach).
	   Per cpu caching is realized using slabs of objects instead
	   of queues of objects. SLUB can use memory efficiently
	   and has enhanced diagnostics. SLUB is the default choice for
	   a slab allocator.

config SLOB
	depends on EMBEDDED
	bool "SLOB (Simple Allocator)"

	   SLOB replaces the stock allocator with a drastically simpler
	   allocator. SLOB is generally more space efficient but
	   does not perform as well on large systems.

menuconfig MODULES
	bool "Enable loadable module support"
	help
	  Kernel modules are small pieces of compiled code which can
	  be inserted in the running kernel, rather than being
	  permanently built into the kernel.  You use the "modprobe"
	  tool to add (and sometimes remove) them.  If you say Y here,
	  many parts of the kernel can be built as modules (by
	  answering M instead of Y where indicated): this is most
	  useful for infrequently used options which are not required
	  for booting.  For more information, see the man pages for
	  modprobe, lsmod, modinfo, insmod and rmmod.

	  If you say Y here, you will need to run "make
	  modules_install" to put the modules under /lib/modules/
	  where modprobe can find them (you may need to be root to do
	  this).

	  If unsure, say Y.

config MODULE_FORCE_LOAD
	bool "Forced module loading"
	default n
	help
	  Allow loading of modules without version information (ie. modprobe
	  --force).  Forced module loading sets the 'F' (forced) taint flag and
	  is usually a really bad idea.

config MODULE_UNLOAD
	bool "Module unloading"
	help
	  Without this option you will not be able to unload any
	  modules (note that some modules may not be unloadable
	  anyway), which makes your kernel smaller, faster
	  and simpler.  If unsure, say Y.

config MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD
	bool "Forced module unloading"
	depends on MODULE_UNLOAD && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This option allows you to force a module to unload, even if the
	  kernel believes it is unsafe: the kernel will remove the module
	  without waiting for anyone to stop using it (using the -f option to
	  rmmod).  This is mainly for kernel developers and desperate users.
	  If unsure, say N.

config MODVERSIONS
	bool "Module versioning support"
	help
	  Usually, you have to use modules compiled with your kernel.
	  Saying Y here makes it sometimes possible to use modules
	  compiled for different kernels, by adding enough information
	  to the modules to (hopefully) spot any changes which would
	  make them incompatible with the kernel you are running.  If
	  unsure, say N.

config MODULE_SRCVERSION_ALL
	bool "Source checksum for all modules"
	help
	  Modules which contain a MODULE_VERSION get an extra "srcversion"
	  field inserted into their modinfo section, which contains a
    	  sum of the source files which made it.  This helps maintainers
	  see exactly which source was used to build a module (since
	  others sometimes change the module source without updating
	  the version).  With this option, such a "srcversion" field
	  will be created for all modules.  If unsure, say N.
