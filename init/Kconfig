	  of each CPU as a power of 2. The used space is typically only few

	  e.g. backtraces.

	  The increased size means that a new buffer has to be allocated and
	  the original static one is unused. It makes sense only on systems
	  with more CPUs. Therefore this value is used only when the sum of
	  contributions is greater than the half of the default kernel ring
	  buffer as defined by LOG_BUF_SHIFT. The default values are set
	  so that more than 64 CPUs are needed to trigger the allocation.

	  Also this option is ignored when "log_buf_len" kernel parameter is
	  used as it forces an exact (power of two) size of the ring buffer.

	  The number of possible CPUs is used for this computation ignoring
	  hotplugging making the compuation optimal for the the worst case
	  scenerio while allowing a simple algorithm to be used from bootup.

	help
	  Enable kernel support for various performance events provided
	  by software and hardware.

	  Software events are supported either built-in or via the
	  use of generic tracepoints.

	  Most modern CPUs support performance events via performance
	  counter registers. These registers count the number of certain
	  types of hw events: such as instructions executed, cachemisses
	  suffered, or branches mis-predicted - without slowing down the
	  kernel or applications. These registers can also trigger interrupts
	  when a threshold number of events have passed - and can thus be
	  used to profile the code that runs on that CPU.

	  The Linux Performance Event subsystem provides an abstraction of
	  these software and hardware event capabilities, available via a
	  system call and used by the "perf" utility in tools/perf/. It
	  provides per task and per CPU counters, and it provides event
	  capabilities on top of those.

	   SLUB is a slab allocator that minimizes cache line usage

	  Per cpu partial caches accellerate objects allocation and freeing

	  Typically one would choose no for a realtime system.

config MMAP_ALLOW_UNINITIALIZED
	bool "Allow mmapped anonymous memory to be uninitialized"
	depends on EXPERT && !MMU
	default n
	help
	  Normally, and according to the Linux spec, anonymous memory obtained
	  from mmap() has it's contents cleared before it is passed to
	  userspace.  Enabling this config option allows you to request that
	  mmap() skip that if it is given an MAP_UNINITIALIZED flag, thus
	  providing a huge performance boost.  If this option is not enabled,
	  then the flag will be ignored.

	  This is taken advantage of by uClibc's malloc(), and also by
	  ELF-FDPIC binfmt's brk and stack allocator.

	  Because of the obvious security issues, this option should only be
	  enabled on embedded devices where you control what is run in
	  userspace.  Since that isn't generally a problem on no-MMU systems,
	  it is normally safe to say Y here.

	bool "Enable loadable module support"
	option modules
	help
	  Kernel modules are small pieces of compiled code which can
	  be inserted in the running kernel, rather than being
	  permanently built into the kernel.  You use the "modprobe"
	  tool to add (and sometimes remove) them.  If you say Y here,
	  many parts of the kernel can be built as modules (by
	  answering M instead of Y where indicated): this is most
	  useful for infrequently used options which are not required
	  for booting.  For more information, see the man pages for
	  modprobe, lsmod, modinfo, insmod and rmmod.

	  If you say Y here, you will need to run "make
	  modules_install" to put the modules under /lib/modules/
	  where modprobe can find them (you may need to be root to do
	  this).

	  If unsure, say Y.

config MODULE_FORCE_LOAD

	  Allow loading of modules without version information (ie. modprobe

	  is usually a really bad idea.

config MODULE_UNLOAD
	bool "Module unloading"
	help
	  Without this option you will not be able to unload any
	  modules (note that some modules may not be unloadable
	  anyway), which makes your kernel smaller, faster
	  and simpler.  If unsure, say Y.

config MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD
	bool "Forced module unloading"
	depends on MODULE_UNLOAD
	help
	  This option allows you to force a module to unload, even if the
	  kernel believes it is unsafe: the kernel will remove the module
	  without waiting for anyone to stop using it (using the -f option to
	  rmmod).  This is mainly for kernel developers and desperate users.
	  If unsure, say N.

config MODVERSIONS
	bool "Module versioning support"
	help
	  Usually, you have to use modules compiled with your kernel.
	  Saying Y here makes it sometimes possible to use modules
	  compiled for different kernels, by adding enough information
	  to the modules to (hopefully) spot any changes which would
	  make them incompatible with the kernel you are running.  If
	  unsure, say N.

config MODULE_SRCVERSION_ALL
	bool "Source checksum for all modules"
	help
	  Modules which contain a MODULE_VERSION get an extra "srcversion"
	  field inserted into their modinfo section, which contains a
    	  sum of the source files which made it.  This helps maintainers
	  see exactly which source was used to build a module (since
	  others sometimes change the module source without updating
	  the version).  With this option, such a "srcversion" field
	  will be created for all modules.  If unsure, say N.

config MODULE_SIG

	  Note that this option adds the OpenSSL development packages as a
	  kernel build dependency so that the signing tool can use its crypto
	  library.

	  !!!WARNING!!!  If you enable this option, you MUST make sure that the
	  module DOES NOT get stripped after being signed.  This includes the

	  inclusion into an initramfs that wants the module size reduced.

config MODULE_SIG_FORCE
