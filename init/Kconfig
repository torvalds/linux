config EXPERIMENTAL
	bool "Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers"
	---help---
	  Some of the various things that Linux supports (such as network
	  drivers, file systems, network protocols, etc.) can be in a state
	  of development where the functionality, stability, or the level of
	  testing is not yet high enough for general use. This is usually
	  known as the "alpha-test" phase among developers. If a feature is
	  currently in alpha-test, then the developers usually discourage
	  uninformed widespread use of this feature by the general public to
	  avoid "Why doesn't this work?" type mail messages. However, active
	  testing and use of these systems is welcomed. Just be aware that it
	  may not meet the normal level of reliability or it may fail to work
	  in some special cases. Detailed bug reports from people familiar
	  with the kernel internals are usually welcomed by the developers
	  (before submitting bug reports, please read the documents
	  <file:README>, <file:MAINTAINERS>, <file:REPORTING-BUGS>,
	  <file:Documentation/BUG-HUNTING>, and
	  <file:Documentation/oops-tracing.txt> in the kernel source).

	  This option will also make obsoleted drivers available. These are
	  drivers that have been replaced by something else, and/or are
	  scheduled to be removed in a future kernel release.

	  Unless you intend to help test and develop a feature or driver that
	  falls into this category, or you have a situation that requires
	  using these features, you should probably say N here, which will
	  cause the configurator to present you with fewer choices. If
	  you say Y here, you will be offered the choice of using features or
	  drivers that are currently considered to be in the alpha-test phase.

config LOCALVERSION
	string "Local version - append to kernel release"
	help
	  Append an extra string to the end of your kernel version.
	  This will show up when you type uname, for example.
	  The string you set here will be appended after the contents of
	  any files with a filename matching localversion* in your
	  object and source tree, in that order.  Your total string can
	  be a maximum of 64 characters.

config LOCALVERSION_AUTO
	bool "Automatically append version information to the version string"
	default y
	help
	  This will try to automatically determine if the current tree is a
	  release tree by looking for git tags that
	  belong to the current top of tree revision.

	  A string of the format -gxxxxxxxx will be added to the localversion
	  if a git based tree is found.  The string generated by this will be
	  appended after any matching localversion* files, and after the value
	  set in CONFIG_LOCALVERSION

	  Note: This requires Perl, and a git repository, but not necessarily
	  the git or cogito tools to be installed.

config SWAP

	  in your computer.  If unsure say Y.

config SYSVIPC
	bool "System V IPC"
	---help---
	  Inter Process Communication is a suite of library functions and
	  system calls which let processes (running programs) synchronize and
	  exchange information. It is generally considered to be a good thing,
	  and some programs won't run unless you say Y here. In particular, if
	  you want to run the DOS emulator dosemu under Linux (read the
	  DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>),

config POSIX_MQUEUE
	bool "POSIX Message Queues"
	depends on NET && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  POSIX variant of message queues is a part of IPC. In POSIX message
	  queues every message has a priority which decides about succession
	  of receiving it by a process. If you want to compile and run
	  programs written e.g. for Solaris with use of its POSIX message
	  queues (functions mq_*) say Y here. To use this feature you will
	  also need mqueue library, available from
	  <http://www.mat.uni.torun.pl/~wrona/posix_ipc/>

	  POSIX message queues are visible as a filesystem called 'mqueue'
	  and can be mounted somewhere if you want to do filesystem
	  operations on message queues.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config BSD_PROCESS_ACCT
	bool "BSD Process Accounting"
	help
	  If you say Y here, a user level program will be able to instruct the
	  kernel (via a special system call) to write process accounting
	  information to a file: whenever a process exits, information about
	  that process will be appended to the file by the kernel.  The
	  information includes things such as creation time, owning user,
	  command name, memory usage, controlling terminal etc. (the complete
	  list is in the struct acct in <file:include/linux/acct.h>).  It is
	  up to the user level program to do useful things with this
	  information.  This is generally a good idea, so say Y.

config BSD_PROCESS_ACCT_V3
	bool "BSD Process Accounting version 3 file format"
	depends on BSD_PROCESS_ACCT
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, the process accounting information is written
	  in a new file format that also logs the process IDs of each
	  process and it's parent. Note that this file format is incompatible
	  with previous v0/v1/v2 file formats, so you will need updated tools
	  for processing it. A preliminary version of these tools is available
	  at <http://www.physik3.uni-rostock.de/tim/kernel/utils/acct/>.

config TASKSTATS
	bool "Export task/process statistics through netlink (EXPERIMENTAL)"

	  space on task exit.

	  Say N if unsure.

config TASK_DELAY_ACCT

	depends on TASKSTATS
	help
	  Collect information on time spent by a task waiting for system
	  resources like cpu, synchronous block I/O completion and swapping

	depends on NET
	help
	  Enable auditing infrastructure that can be used with another

config IKCONFIG
	tristate "Kernel .config support"
	---help---
	  This option enables the complete Linux kernel ".config" file
	  contents to be saved in the kernel. It provides documentation
	  of which kernel options are used in a running kernel or in an
	  on-disk kernel.  This information can be extracted from the kernel
	  image file with the script scripts/extract-ikconfig and used as
	  input to rebuild the current kernel or to build another kernel.
	  It can also be extracted from a running kernel by reading
	  /proc/config.gz if enabled (below).

config IKCONFIG_PROC
	bool "Enable access to .config through /proc/config.gz"
	depends on IKCONFIG && PROC_FS
	---help---
	  This option enables access to the kernel configuration file
	  through /proc/config.gz.

config CPUSETS
	bool "Cpuset support"
	depends on SMP
	help
	  This option will let you create and manage CPUSETs which
	  allow dynamically partitioning a system into sets of CPUs and
	  Memory Nodes and assigning tasks to run only within those sets.
	  This is primarily useful on large SMP or NUMA systems.

	  Say N if unsure.

config SYSFS_DEPRECATED
	bool "Create deprecated sysfs files"
	default y
	help
	  This option creates deprecated symlinks such as the
	  "device"-link, the <subsystem>:<name>-link, and the
	  "bus"-link. It may also add deprecated key in the
	  uevent environment.
	  None of these features or values should be used today, as
	  they export driver core implementation details to userspace
	  or export properties which can't be kept stable across kernel
	  releases.

	  If enabled, this option will also move any device structures
	  that belong to a class, back into the /sys/class heirachy, in
	  order to support older versions of udev.

	  If you are using a distro that was released in 2006 or later,
	  it should be safe to say N here.

config RELAY
	bool "Kernel->user space relay support (formerly relayfs)"
	help
	  This option enables support for relay interface support in
	  certain file systems (such as debugfs).
	  It is designed to provide an efficient mechanism for tools and
	  facilities to relay large amounts of data from kernel space to
	  user space.

	  If unsure, say N.

config BLK_DEV_INITRD
	bool "Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) support"
	depends on BROKEN || !FRV
	help
	  The initial RAM filesystem is a ramfs which is loaded by the
	  boot loader (loadlin or lilo) and that is mounted as root
	  before the normal boot procedure. It is typically used to
	  load modules needed to mount the "real" root file system,
	  etc. See <file:Documentation/initrd.txt> for details.

	  If RAM disk support (BLK_DEV_RAM) is also included, this
	  also enables initial RAM disk (initrd) support and adds
	  15 Kbytes (more on some other architectures) to the kernel size.

	  If unsure say Y.

	  This enables the legacy 16-bit UID syscall wrappers.

config SYSCTL_SYSCALL
	bool "Sysctl syscall support" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	select SYSCTL
	---help---
	  sys_sysctl uses binary paths that have been found challenging
	  to properly maintain and use.  The interface in /proc/sys
	  using paths with ascii names is now the primary path to this
	  information.

	  Almost nothing using the binary sysctl interface so if you are
	  trying to save some space it is probably safe to disable this,
	  making your kernel marginally smaller.

	  If unsure say Y here.

config KALLSYMS
	 bool "Load all symbols for debugging/ksymoops" if EMBEDDED
	 default y
	 help
	   Say Y here to let the kernel print out symbolic crash information and

config KALLSYMS_ALL
	bool "Include all symbols in kallsyms"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && KALLSYMS

	   Normally kallsyms only contains the symbols of functions, for nicer
	   OOPS messages.  Some debuggers can use kallsyms for other
	   symbols too: say Y here to include all symbols, if you need them 
	   and you don't care about adding 300k to the size of your kernel.

	   Say N.

config KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS
	bool "Do an extra kallsyms pass"
	depends on KALLSYMS
	help
	   If kallsyms is not working correctly, the build will fail with
	   inconsistent kallsyms data.  If that occurs, log a bug report and
	   turn on KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS which should result in a stable build.
	   Always say N here unless you find a bug in kallsyms, which must be
	   reported.  KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS is only a temporary workaround while
	   you wait for kallsyms to be fixed.


config HOTPLUG
	bool "Support for hot-pluggable devices" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	help
	  This option is provided for the case where no hotplug or uevent
	  capabilities is wanted by the kernel.  You should only consider
	  disabling this option for embedded systems that do not use modules, a
	  dynamic /dev tree, or dynamic device discovery.  Just say Y.

config PRINTK
	default y
	bool "Enable support for printk" if EMBEDDED
	help
	  This option enables normal printk support. Removing it
	  eliminates most of the message strings from the kernel image
	  and makes the kernel more or less silent. As this makes it
	  very difficult to diagnose system problems, saying N here is
	  strongly discouraged.

config BUG
	bool "BUG() support" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	help
          Disabling this option eliminates support for BUG and WARN, reducing
          the size of your kernel image and potentially quietly ignoring
          numerous fatal conditions. You should only consider disabling this
          option for embedded systems with no facilities for reporting errors.
          Just say Y.

config ELF_CORE

config BASE_FULL
	default y
	bool "Enable full-sized data structures for core" if EMBEDDED

	  but may reduce performance.

config FUTEX

	  run glibc-based applications correctly.

config EPOLL
	bool "Enable eventpoll support" if EMBEDDED

config SHMEM
	bool "Use full shmem filesystem" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	depends on MMU
	help
	  The shmem is an internal filesystem used to manage shared memory.
	  It is backed by swap and manages resource limits. It is also exported
	  to userspace as tmpfs if TMPFS is enabled. Disabling this
	  option replaces shmem and tmpfs with the much simpler ramfs code,
	  which may be appropriate on small systems without swap.

config SLAB
	default y
	bool "Use full SLAB allocator" if (EMBEDDED && !SMP && !SPARSEMEM)

config MODULES
	bool "Enable loadable module support"
	help
	  Kernel modules are small pieces of compiled code which can
	  be inserted in the running kernel, rather than being
	  permanently built into the kernel.  You use the "modprobe"
	  tool to add (and sometimes remove) them.  If you say Y here,
	  many parts of the kernel can be built as modules (by
	  answering M instead of Y where indicated): this is most
	  useful for infrequently used options which are not required
	  for booting.  For more information, see the man pages for
	  modprobe, lsmod, modinfo, insmod and rmmod.

	  If you say Y here, you will need to run "make
	  modules_install" to put the modules under /lib/modules/
	  where modprobe can find them (you may need to be root to do
	  this).

	  If unsure, say Y.

config MODULE_UNLOAD
	bool "Module unloading"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  Without this option you will not be able to unload any
	  modules (note that some modules may not be unloadable

	  simpler.  If unsure, say Y.

config MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD
	bool "Forced module unloading"
	depends on MODULE_UNLOAD && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This option allows you to force a module to unload, even if the
	  kernel believes it is unsafe: the kernel will remove the module
	  without waiting for anyone to stop using it (using the -f option to
	  rmmod).  This is mainly for kernel developers and desperate users.
	  If unsure, say N.

config MODVERSIONS
	bool "Module versioning support"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  Usually, you have to use modules compiled with your kernel.
	  Saying Y here makes it sometimes possible to use modules
	  compiled for different kernels, by adding enough information
	  to the modules to (hopefully) spot any changes which would
	  make them incompatible with the kernel you are running.  If
	  unsure, say N.

config MODULE_SRCVERSION_ALL
	bool "Source checksum for all modules"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  Modules which contain a MODULE_VERSION get an extra "srcversion"
	  field inserted into their modinfo section, which contains a
    	  sum of the source files which made it.  This helps maintainers
	  see exactly which source was used to build a module (since
	  others sometimes change the module source without updating
	  the version).  With this option, such a "srcversion" field
	  will be created for all modules.  If unsure, say N.

config KMOD

	depends on MODULES
	help
	  Normally when you have selected some parts of the kernel to
	  be created as kernel modules, you must load them (using the
