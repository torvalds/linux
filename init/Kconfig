	bool "Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers"
	---help---
	  Some of the various things that Linux supports (such as network
	  drivers, file systems, network protocols, etc.) can be in a state
	  of development where the functionality, stability, or the level of
	  testing is not yet high enough for general use. This is usually
	  known as the "alpha-test" phase among developers. If a feature is
	  currently in alpha-test, then the developers usually discourage
	  uninformed widespread use of this feature by the general public to
	  avoid "Why doesn't this work?" type mail messages. However, active
	  testing and use of these systems is welcomed. Just be aware that it
	  may not meet the normal level of reliability or it may fail to work
	  in some special cases. Detailed bug reports from people familiar
	  with the kernel internals are usually welcomed by the developers
	  (before submitting bug reports, please read the documents
	  <file:README>, <file:MAINTAINERS>, <file:REPORTING-BUGS>,
	  <file:Documentation/BUG-HUNTING>, and
	  <file:Documentation/oops-tracing.txt> in the kernel source).

	  This option will also make obsoleted drivers available. These are
	  drivers that have been replaced by something else, and/or are
	  scheduled to be removed in a future kernel release.

	  Unless you intend to help test and develop a feature or driver that
	  falls into this category, or you have a situation that requires
	  using these features, you should probably say N here, which will
	  cause the configurator to present you with fewer choices. If
	  you say Y here, you will be offered the choice of using features or
	  drivers that are currently considered to be in the alpha-test phase.

	  Append an extra string to the end of your kernel version.
	  This will show up when you type uname, for example.

	  A string of the format -gxxxxxxxx will be added to the localversion
	  if a git-based tree is found.  The string generated by this will be
	  appended after any matching localversion* files, and after the value
	  set in CONFIG_LOCALVERSION.

	  If you say Y here, the process accounting information is written
	  in a new file format that also logs the process IDs of each
	  process and it's parent. Note that this file format is incompatible

config PRINTK

	  This option enables normal printk support. Removing it
	  eliminates most of the message strings from the kernel image

	  strongly discouraged.

config BUG

          Disabling this option eliminates support for BUG and WARN, reducing

menuconfig MODULES
	bool "Enable loadable module support"
	help
	  Kernel modules are small pieces of compiled code which can
	  be inserted in the running kernel, rather than being
	  permanently built into the kernel.  You use the "modprobe"
	  tool to add (and sometimes remove) them.  If you say Y here,
	  many parts of the kernel can be built as modules (by
	  answering M instead of Y where indicated): this is most
	  useful for infrequently used options which are not required
	  for booting.  For more information, see the man pages for
	  modprobe, lsmod, modinfo, insmod and rmmod.

	  If you say Y here, you will need to run "make
	  modules_install" to put the modules under /lib/modules/
	  where modprobe can find them (you may need to be root to do
	  this).

	  If unsure, say Y.

config MODULE_UNLOAD
	bool "Module unloading"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  Without this option you will not be able to unload any
	  modules (note that some modules may not be unloadable
	  anyway), which makes your kernel slightly smaller and
	  simpler.  If unsure, say Y.

config MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD
	bool "Forced module unloading"
	depends on MODULE_UNLOAD && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This option allows you to force a module to unload, even if the
	  kernel believes it is unsafe: the kernel will remove the module
	  without waiting for anyone to stop using it (using the -f option to
	  rmmod).  This is mainly for kernel developers and desperate users.
	  If unsure, say N.

config MODVERSIONS
	bool "Module versioning support"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  Usually, you have to use modules compiled with your kernel.
	  Saying Y here makes it sometimes possible to use modules
	  compiled for different kernels, by adding enough information
	  to the modules to (hopefully) spot any changes which would
	  make them incompatible with the kernel you are running.  If
	  unsure, say N.

config MODULE_SRCVERSION_ALL
	bool "Source checksum for all modules"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  Modules which contain a MODULE_VERSION get an extra "srcversion"
	  field inserted into their modinfo section, which contains a
    	  sum of the source files which made it.  This helps maintainers
	  see exactly which source was used to build a module (since
	  others sometimes change the module source without updating
	  the version).  With this option, such a "srcversion" field
	  will be created for all modules.  If unsure, say N.

config KMOD
	bool "Automatic kernel module loading"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  Normally when you have selected some parts of the kernel to
	  be created as kernel modules, you must load them (using the
	  "modprobe" command) before you can use them. If you say Y
	  here, some parts of the kernel will be able to load modules
	  automatically: when a part of the kernel needs a module, it
	  runs modprobe with the appropriate arguments, thereby
	  loading the module if it is available.  If unsure, say Y.

config STOP_MACHINE
	bool
	default y
	depends on (SMP && MODULE_UNLOAD) || HOTPLUG_CPU
	help
	  Need stop_machine() primitive.

config PREEMPT_NOTIFIERS

config CLASSIC_RCU
	def_bool !PREEMPT_RCU
	help
	  This option selects the classic RCU implementation that is
	  designed for best read-side performance on non-realtime
	  systems.  Classic RCU is the default.  Note that the
	  PREEMPT_RCU symbol is used to select/deselect this option.
