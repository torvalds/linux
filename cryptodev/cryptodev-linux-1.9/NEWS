Version 1.2 (released 2012-02-24)

* In kernels that do not distinguish between hw accelerated ciphers or 
  not set the SIOP_FLAG_KERNEL_DRIVER_ONLY flag based on driver name.

* CIOCGSESSINFO ioctl() sets the SIOP_FLAG_KERNEL_DRIVER_ONLY flag if the 
  driver is only available through kernel driver (and is not just software 
  cipher).

* Added new encryption ioctl, CIOCAUTHCRYPT, which combines authentication 
  and encryption. Operates in AEAD, TLS and SRTP modes (the API might change
  in later versions).
