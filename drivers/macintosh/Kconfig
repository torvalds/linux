	depends on MAC || (PPC_PMAC && PPC32)
	help
	  Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) support is for support of devices which
	  are connected to an ADB port.  ADB devices tend to have 4 pins.
	  If you have an Apple Macintosh prior to the iMac, an iBook or
	  PowerBook, or a "Blue and White G3", you probably want to say Y
	  here.  Otherwise say N.

config ADB_MACII
	bool "Include Mac II ADB driver"
	depends on ADB && MAC
	help
	  Say Y here if want your kernel to support Macintosh systems that use
	  the Mac II style ADB.  This includes the II, IIx, IIcx, SE/30, IIci,

	bool "Include IOP (IIfx/Quadra 9x0) ADB driver"
	depends on ADB && MAC
	help
	  The I/O Processor (IOP) is an Apple custom IC designed to provide
	  intelligent support for I/O controllers.  It is described at
	  <http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/dev68k/iopdesc.html> to enable direct
	  support for it, say 'Y' here.

config ADB_PMU68K

config ADB_CUDA
	bool "Support for CUDA based Macs and PowerMacs"
	depends on (ADB || PPC_PMAC) && !PPC_PMAC64
	help
	  This provides support for CUDA based Macintosh and Power Macintosh
	  systems.  This includes many m68k based Macs (Color Classic, Mac TV,
	  Performa 475, Performa 520, Performa 550, Performa 575,
	  Performa 588, Quadra 605, Quadra 630, Quadra/Centris 660AV, and
	  Quadra 840AV), most OldWorld PowerMacs, the first generation iMacs,
	  the Blue&White G3 and the "Yikes" G4 (PCI Graphics).  All later
	  models should use CONFIG_ADB_PMU instead.  It is safe to say Y here
	  even if your machine doesn't have a CUDA.

	  If unsure say Y.

config ADB_PMU
	bool "Support for PMU  based PowerMacs"
	depends on PPC_PMAC
	help
	  On PowerBooks, iBooks, and recent iMacs and Power Macintoshes, the
	  PMU is an embedded microprocessor whose primary function is to
	  control system power, and battery charging on the portable models.
	  The PMU also controls the ADB (Apple Desktop Bus) which connects to
	  the keyboard and mouse on some machines, as well as the non-volatile
	  RAM and the RTC (real time clock) chip.  Say Y to enable support for
	  this device; you should do so if your machine is one of those
	  mentioned above.

config ADB_PMU_LED
	bool "Support for the Power/iBook front LED"
	depends on ADB_PMU
	select NEW_LEDS
	select LEDS_CLASS
	help
	  Support the front LED on Power/iBooks as a generic LED that can
	  be triggered by any of the supported triggers. To get the
	  behaviour of the old CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_PMAC_BLINK, select this
	  and the ide-disk LED trigger and configure appropriately through
	  sysfs.

config ADB_PMU_LED_IDE
	bool "Use front LED as IDE LED by default"
	depends on ADB_PMU_LED
	select LEDS_TRIGGERS
	select LEDS_TRIGGER_IDE_DISK
	help
	  This option makes the front LED default to the IDE trigger
	  so that it blinks on IDE activity.

config PMAC_SMU
	bool "Support for SMU  based PowerMacs"
	depends on PPC_PMAC64
	help
	  This option adds support for the newer G5 iMacs and PowerMacs based
	  on the "SMU" system control chip which replaces the old PMU.
	  If you don't know, say Y.

	depends on ADB_PMU && PM && PPC32

config PMAC_MEDIABAY
	bool "Support PowerBook hotswap media bay"
	depends on PPC_PMAC && PPC32
	help
	  This option adds support for older PowerBook's hotswap media bay
	  that can contains batteries, floppy drives, or IDE devices. PCI
	  devices are not fully supported in the bay as I never had one to
	  try with

config PMAC_BACKLIGHT
	bool "Backlight control for LCD screens"
	depends on ADB_PMU && FB = y && (BROKEN || !PPC64)
	select FB_BACKLIGHT
	help
	  Say Y here to enable Macintosh specific extensions of the generic
	  backlight code. With this enabled, the brightness keys on older
	  PowerBooks will be enabled so you can change the screen brightness.
	  Newer models should use a userspace daemon like pbbuttonsd.

config PMAC_BACKLIGHT_LEGACY
	bool "Provide legacy ioctl's on /dev/pmu for the backlight"
	depends on PMAC_BACKLIGHT && (BROKEN || !PPC64)
	help
	  Say Y if you want to enable legacy ioctl's on /dev/pmu. This is for
	  programs which use this old interface. New and updated programs
	  should use the backlight classes in sysfs.

config ADB_MACIO
	bool "Include MacIO (CHRP) ADB driver"
	depends on ADB && PPC_CHRP && !PPC_PMAC64
	help
	  Say Y here to include direct support for the ADB controller in the
	  Hydra chip used on PowerPC Macintoshes of the CHRP type.  (The Hydra
	  also includes a MESH II SCSI controller, DBDMA controller, VIA chip,
	  OpenPIC controller and two RS422/Geoports.)

config INPUT_ADBHID
	bool "Support for ADB input devices (keyboard, mice, ...)"
	depends on ADB && INPUT=y
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to have ADB (Apple Desktop Bus) HID devices
	  such as keyboards, mice, joysticks, trackpads  or graphic tablets
	  handled by the input layer.  If you say Y here, make sure to say Y to
	  the corresponding drivers "Keyboard support" (CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBDEV),
	  "Mouse Support" (CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV) and "Event interface
	  support" (CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV) as well.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config MAC_EMUMOUSEBTN
	bool "Support for mouse button 2+3 emulation"
	select INPUT
	help
	  This provides generic support for emulating the 2nd and 3rd mouse
	  button with keypresses.  If you say Y here, the emulation is still
	  disabled by default.  The emulation is controlled by these sysctl
	  entries:
	  /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button_emulation
	  /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button2_keycode
	  /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button3_keycode

	  If you have an Apple machine with a 1-button mouse, say Y here.
