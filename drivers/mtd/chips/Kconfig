	select MTD_GEN_PROBE
	select MTD_CFI_UTIL
	help
	  The Common Flash Interface specification was developed by Intel,
	  AMD and other flash manufactures that provides a universal method
	  for probing the capabilities of flash devices. If you wish to
	  support any device that is CFI-compliant, you need to enable this
	  option. Visit <http://www.amd.com/products/nvd/overview/cfi.html>
	  for more information on CFI.

config MTD_JEDECPROBE
	tristate "Detect non-CFI AMD/JEDEC-compatible flash chips"
	select MTD_GEN_PROBE
	help
	  This option enables JEDEC-style probing of flash chips which are not
	  compatible with the Common Flash Interface, but will use the common
	  CFI-targeted flash drivers for any chips which are identified which
	  are in fact compatible in all but the probe method. This actually
	  covers most AMD/Fujitsu-compatible chips and also non-CFI
	  Intel chips.

	help
	  If you need to specify a specific endianness for access to flash
	  chips, or if you wish to reduce the size of the kernel by including
	  support for only specific arrangements of flash chips, say 'Y'. This
	  option does not directly affect the code, but will enable other
	  configuration options which allow you to do so.

	  If unsure, say 'N'.

	---help---
	  This option defines the way in which the CPU attempts to arrange
	  data bits when writing the 'magic' commands to the chips. Saying
	  'NO', which is the default when CONFIG_MTD_CFI_ADV_OPTIONS isn't
	  enabled, means that the CPU will not do any swapping; the chips
	  are expected to be wired to the CPU in 'host-endian' form.
	  Specific arrangements are possible with the BIG_ENDIAN_BYTE and
	  LITTLE_ENDIAN_BYTE, if the bytes are reversed.

	  This option does not affect the code directly, but will enable

config MTD_OTP
	bool "Protection Registers aka one-time programmable (OTP) bits"
	depends on MTD_CFI_ADV_OPTIONS
	default n
	help
	  This enables support for reading, writing and locking so called
	  "Protection Registers" present on some flash chips.
	  A subset of them are pre-programmed at the factory with a
	  unique set of values. The rest is user-programmable.

	  The user-programmable Protection Registers contain one-time
	  programmable (OTP) bits; when programmed, register bits cannot be
	  erased. Each Protection Register can be accessed multiple times to
	  program individual bits, as long as the register remains unlocked.

	  Each Protection Register has an associated Lock Register bit. When a
	  Lock Register bit is programmed, the associated Protection Register
	  can only be read; it can no longer be programmed. Additionally,
	  because the Lock Register bits themselves are OTP, when programmed,
	  Lock Register bits cannot be erased. Therefore, when a Protection
	  Register is locked, it cannot be unlocked.

	  This feature should therefore be used with extreme care. Any mistake
	  in the programming of OTP bits will waste them.

	help
	  This option enables support for a dummy probing driver used to
	  allocated placeholder MTD devices on systems that have socketed
	  or removable media.  Use of this driver as a fallback chip probe
	  preserves the expected registration order of MTD device nodes on
