config MTD_ONENAND
	tristate "OneNAND Device Support"
	depends on MTD
	help
	  This enables support for accessing all type of OneNAND flash
	  devices. For further information see
	  <http://www.samsung.com/Products/Semiconductor/Flash/OneNAND_TM/index.htm>.

config MTD_ONENAND_VERIFY_WRITE
	bool "Verify OneNAND page writes"
	depends on MTD_ONENAND
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  OneNAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentaly due to device wear or something else.

config MTD_ONENAND_GENERIC
	tristate "OneNAND Flash device on generic board"
	depends on MTD_ONENAND
	help
	  Support for OneNAND flash on generic board. Using device driver
	  framework, now all most platfrom are support.

config MTD_ONENAND_OMAP
	tristate "OneNAND Flash device on OMAP board"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP && MTD_ONENAND
	help
	  Support for OneNAND flash on TI OMAP board.

config MTD_ONENAND_SYNC_READ
	bool "OneNAND Sync. Burst Read Support"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP
	help
	  This enables support for Sync. Burst Read.

config MTD_ONENAND_SIM
	tristate "Support for OneNAND flash simulator"
	depends on MTD_ONENAND
	help
	  The simulator may simulate verious OneNAND flash chips for the
          MTD onenand layer.
