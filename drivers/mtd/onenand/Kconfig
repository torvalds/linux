config MTD_ONENAND
	tristate "OneNAND Device Support"
	depends on MTD
	help
	  This enables support for accessing all type of OneNAND flash
	  devices. For further information see
	  <http://www.samsung.com/Products/Semiconductor/Flash/OneNAND_TM/index.htm>.

config MTD_ONENAND_VERIFY_WRITE
	bool "Verify OneNAND page writes"
	depends on MTD_ONENAND
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  OneNAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentaly due to device wear or something else.

config MTD_ONENAND_GENERIC
	tristate "OneNAND Flash device via platform device driver"
	depends on MTD_ONENAND && ARM
	help
	  Support for OneNAND flash via platform device driver.

config MTD_ONENAND_OTP
	bool "OneNAND OTP Support"
	depends on MTD_ONENAND
	help
	  One Block of the NAND Flash Array memory is reserved as
	  a One-Time Programmable Block memory area.
	  Also, 1st Block of NAND Flash Array can be used as OTP.

	  The OTP block can be read, programmed and locked using the same
	  operations as any other NAND Flash Array memory block.
	  OTP block cannot be erased.

	  OTP block is fully-guaranteed to be a valid block.

config MTD_ONENAND_SYNC_READ
	bool "OneNAND Sync. Burst Read Support"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP
	help
	  This enables support for Sync. Burst Read.
