	depends on MTD_CFI || MTD_JEDECPROBE || MTD_ROM || MTD_LPDDR
	help
	  This provides a 'mapping' driver which allows the NOR Flash and
	  ROM driver code to communicate with chips which are mapped
	  physically into the CPU's memory. You will need to configure
	  the physical address and size of the flash chips on your
	  particular board as well as the bus width, either statically
	  with config options or at run-time.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called physmap.

config MTD_PHYSMAP_COMPAT
	bool "Physmap compat support"
	depends on MTD_PHYSMAP
	default n
	help
	  Setup a simple mapping via the Kconfig options.  Normally the

	hex "Physical length of flash mapping"
	depends on MTD_PHYSMAP_COMPAT
	default "0"
	help
	  This is the total length of the mapping of the flash chips on
	  your particular board. If there is space, or aliases, in the
	  physical memory map between the chips, this could be larger
	  than the total amount of flash present. Refer to the memory
	  map which should hopefully be in the documentation for your
	  board.

config MTD_PHYSMAP_BANKWIDTH
	int "Bank width in octets"
	depends on MTD_PHYSMAP_COMPAT
	default "2"
	help
	  This is the total width of the data bus of the flash devices
	  in octets. For example, if you have a data bus width of 32
	  bits, you would set the bus width octet value to 4. This is
	  used internally by the CFI drivers.
