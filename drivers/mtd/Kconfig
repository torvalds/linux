	  Memory Technology Devices are flash, RAM and similar chips, often
	  used for solid state file systems on embedded devices. This option
	  will provide the generic support for MTD drivers to register
	  themselves with the kernel and for potential users of MTD devices
	  to enumerate the devices which are present and obtain a handle on
	  them. It will also allow you to select individual drivers for
	  particular hardware and users of MTD devices. If unsure, say N.

	  This option includes various MTD tests into compilation. The tests
	  should normally be compiled as kernel modules. The modules perform

	  WARNING: some of the tests will ERASE entire MTD device which they

config MTD_REDBOOT_PARTS
	tristate "RedBoot partition table parsing"
	---help---
	  RedBoot is a ROM monitor and bootloader which deals with multiple
	  'images' in flash devices by putting a table one of the erase
	  blocks on the device, similar to a partition table, which gives
	  the offsets, lengths and names of all the images stored in the
	  flash.

	  If you need code which can detect and parse this table, and register
	  MTD 'partitions' corresponding to each image in the table, enable
	  this option.

	  You will still need the parsing functions to be called by the driver
	  for your particular device. It won't happen automatically. The
	  SA1100 map driver (CONFIG_MTD_SA1100) has an option for this, for
	  example.

	---help---
	  This option is the Linux counterpart to the
	  CYGNUM_REDBOOT_FIS_DIRECTORY_BLOCK RedBoot compile time
	  option.

	  The option specifies which Flash sectors holds the RedBoot
	  partition table.  A zero or positive value gives an absolute
	  erase block number. A negative value specifies a number of
	  sectors before the end of the device.

	  For example "2" means block number 2, "-1" means the last
	  block and "-2" means the penultimate block.

	tristate "Command line partition table parsing"
	depends on MTD
	---help---
	  Allow generic configuration of the MTD partition tables via the kernel
	  command line. Multiple flash resources are supported for hardware where
	  different kinds of flash memory are available.

	  You will still need the parsing functions to be called by the driver
	  for your particular device. It won't happen automatically. The
	  SA1100 map driver (CONFIG_MTD_SA1100) has an option for this, for
	  example.

	  The format for the command line is as follows:

	  mtdparts=<mtddef>[;<mtddef]
	  <mtddef>  := <mtd-id>:<partdef>[,<partdef>]
	  <partdef> := <size>[@offset][<name>][ro]
	  <mtd-id>  := unique id used in mapping driver/device
	  <size>    := standard linux memsize OR "-" to denote all
	  remaining space
	  <name>    := (NAME)

	  Due to the way Linux handles the command line, no spaces are
	  allowed in the partition definition, including mtd id's and partition
	  names.

	  Examples:

	  1 flash resource (mtd-id "sa1100"), with 1 single writable partition:
	  mtdparts=sa1100:-

	  Same flash, but 2 named partitions, the first one being read-only:
	  mtdparts=sa1100:256k(ARMboot)ro,-(root)

	  If unsure, say 'N'.

	---help---
	  Although most flash chips have an erase size too large to be useful
	  as block devices, it is possible to use MTD devices which are based
	  on RAM chips in this manner. This block device is a user of MTD
	  devices performing that function.

	  At the moment, it is also required for the Journalling Flash File
	  System(s) to obtain a handle on the MTD device when it's mounted
	  (although JFFS and JFFS2 don't actually use any of the functionality
	  of the mtdblock device).

	  Later, it may be extended to perform read/erase/modify/write cycles
	  on flash chips to emulate a smaller block size. Needless to say,
	  this is very unsafe, but could be useful for file systems which are
	  almost never written to.

	  You do not need this option for use with the DiskOnChip devices. For
