	  Memory Technology Devices are flash, RAM and similar chips, often
	  used for solid state file systems on embedded devices. This option
	  will provide the generic support for MTD drivers to register
	  themselves with the kernel and for potential users of MTD devices
	  to enumerate the devices which are present and obtain a handle on
	  them. It will also allow you to select individual drivers for
	  particular hardware and users of MTD devices. If unsure, say N.

	  This option includes various MTD tests into compilation. The tests
	  should normally be compiled as kernel modules. The modules perform
	  various checks and verifications when loaded.

	  WARNING: some of the tests will ERASE entire MTD device which they
	  test. Do not use these tests unless you really know what you do.

config MTD_BLOCK
	tristate "Caching block device access to MTD devices"
	depends on BLOCK
	select MTD_BLKDEVS
	help
	  Although most flash chips have an erase size too large to be useful
	  as block devices, it is possible to use MTD devices which are based
	  on RAM chips in this manner. This block device is a user of MTD
	  devices performing that function.

	  Note that mounting a JFFS2 filesystem doesn't require using mtdblock.
	  It's possible to mount a rootfs using the MTD device on the "root="
	  bootargs as "root=mtd2" or "root=mtd:name_of_device".

	  Later, it may be extended to perform read/erase/modify/write cycles
	  on flash chips to emulate a smaller block size. Needless to say,
	  this is very unsafe, but could be useful for file systems which are
	  almost never written to.

	  You do not need this option for use with the DiskOnChip devices. For
	  those, enable NFTL support (CONFIG_NFTL) instead.

	  This allows you to mount read-only file systems (such as cramfs)
	  from an MTD device, without the overhead (and danger) of the caching
	  driver.

	  You do not need this option for use with the DiskOnChip devices. For

	  This provides support for the original Flash Translation Layer which
	  is part of the PCMCIA specification. It uses a kind of pseudo-
	  file system on a flash device to emulate a block device with
	  512-byte sectors, on top of which you put a 'normal' file system.

	  You may find that the algorithms used in this code are patented
	  unless you live in the Free World where software patents aren't
	  legal - in the USA you are only permitted to use this on PCMCIA
	  hardware, although under the terms of the GPL you're obviously

	  This enables EXPERIMENTAL R/W support for SmartMedia/xD
	  FTL (Flash translation layer).
	  Write support is only lightly tested, therefore this driver
	  isn't recommended to use with valuable data (anyway if you have
	  valuable data, do backups regardless of software/hardware you
	  use, because you never know what will eat your data...)
	  If you only need R/O access, you can use older R/O driver
	  (CONFIG_SSFDC)

config MTD_OOPS

config MTD_PARTITIONED_MASTER
	bool "Retain master device when partitioned"
	default n
	depends on MTD
	help
	  For historical reasons, by default, either a master is present or
	  several partitions are present, but not both. The concern was that
	  data listed in multiple partitions was dangerous; however, SCSI does
	  this and it is frequently useful for applications. This config option
	  leaves the master in even if the device is partitioned. It also makes
	  the parent of the partition device be the master device, rather than
	  what lies behind the master.

config MTD_LAZYECCSTATS
	bool "MTD Lazy ECC Stats collection support"
	default y
	help
	  Normally bad block counts for ECC stats are collected at boot time.
	  This option delays the badblock stats collection until ECCGETSTATS
	  ioctl is invoked on the partition.

	  This can significantly decrease boot times depending on the size of
	  the partition.  If unsure, say 'N'.
