	  This enables support for the Firmware Memory controller (FMC)
	  in the Aspeed AST2500/AST2400 SoCs when attached to SPI NOR chips,
	  and support for the SPI flash memory controller (SPI) for

	  Enable support for the Cadence Quad SPI Flash controller.

	  Cadence QSPI is a specialized controller for connecting an SPI
	  Flash over 1/2/4-bit wide bus. Enable this option if you have a
	  device with a Cadence QSPI controller and want to access the
	  Flash as an MTD device.

	  This enables PCI support for the Intel PCH/PCU SPI controller in

	  and is used to hold BIOS and other persistent settings. Using
	  this driver it is possible to upgrade BIOS directly from Linux.

	  Say N here unless you know what you are doing. Overwriting the
