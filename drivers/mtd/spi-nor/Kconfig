	  device drivers and the SPI NOR device driver.

	help
	  Many flash memories support erasing small (4096 B) sectors. Depending
	  on the usage this feature may provide performance gain in comparison
	  to erasing whole blocks (32/64 KiB).
	  Changing a small part of the flash's contents is usually faster with
	  small sectors. On the other hand erasing should be faster when using
	  64 KiB block instead of 16 × 4 KiB sectors.

	  Please note that some tools/drivers/filesystems may not work with
	  4096 B erase size (e.g. UBIFS requires 15 KiB as a minimum).

config MTD_SPI_NOR_MISC
	bool "Support SPI NOR misc device"
	default n
	help
	  Support obtaining flash information through the ioctl interface
	  of the misc device.
