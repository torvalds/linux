config MTD_NAND
	tristate "NAND Device Support"
	depends on MTD
	select MTD_NAND_IDS
	help
	  This enables support for accessing all type of NAND flash
	  devices. For further information see
	  <http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/tech/nand.html>.

config MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE
	bool "Verify NAND page writes"
	depends on MTD_NAND
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  NAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentaly due to device wear or something else.

config MTD_NAND_AUTCPU12
	tristate "SmartMediaCard on autronix autcpu12 board"
	depends on MTD_NAND && ARCH_AUTCPU12
	help
	  This enables the driver for the autronix autcpu12 board to
	  access the SmartMediaCard.

config MTD_NAND_EDB7312
	tristate "Support for Cirrus Logic EBD7312 evaluation board"
	depends on MTD_NAND && ARCH_EDB7312
	help
	  This enables the driver for the Cirrus Logic EBD7312 evaluation
	  board to access the onboard NAND Flash.

config MTD_NAND_H1900
	tristate "iPAQ H1900 flash"
	depends on MTD_NAND && ARCH_PXA && MTD_PARTITIONS
	help
	  This enables the driver for the iPAQ h1900 flash.

config MTD_NAND_SPIA
	tristate "NAND Flash device on SPIA board"
	depends on ARCH_P720T && MTD_NAND
	help
	  If you had to ask, you don't have one. Say 'N'.

config MTD_NAND_TOTO
	tristate "NAND Flash device on TOTO board"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP && MTD_NAND
	help
	  Support for NAND flash on Texas Instruments Toto platform.

config MTD_NAND_TS7250
	tristate "NAND Flash device on TS-7250 board"
	depends on MACH_TS72XX && MTD_NAND
	help
	  Support for NAND flash on Technologic Systems TS-7250 platform.

config MTD_NAND_IDS
	tristate

config MTD_NAND_AU1550
	tristate "Au1550/1200 NAND support"
	depends on (SOC_AU1200 || SOC_AU1550) && MTD_NAND
	help
	  This enables the driver for the NAND flash controller on the
	  AMD/Alchemy 1550 SOC.

config MTD_NAND_RTC_FROM4
	tristate "Renesas Flash ROM 4-slot interface board (FROM_BOARD4)"
	depends on MTD_NAND && SH_SOLUTION_ENGINE
	select REED_SOLOMON
	select REED_SOLOMON_DEC8
	help
	  This enables the driver for the Renesas Technology AG-AND
	  flash interface board (FROM_BOARD4)

config MTD_NAND_PPCHAMELEONEVB
	tristate "NAND Flash device on PPChameleonEVB board"
	depends on PPCHAMELEONEVB && MTD_NAND
	help
	  This enables the NAND flash driver on the PPChameleon EVB Board.

config MTD_NAND_S3C2410
	tristate "NAND Flash support for S3C2410/S3C2440 SoC"
	depends on ARCH_S3C2410 && MTD_NAND
	help
	  This enables the NAND flash controller on the S3C2410 and S3C2440
	  SoCs

	  No board specfic support is done by this driver, each board
	  must advertise a platform_device for the driver to attach.

config MTD_NAND_S3C2410_DEBUG
	bool "S3C2410 NAND driver debug"
	depends on MTD_NAND_S3C2410
	help
	  Enable debugging of the S3C2410 NAND driver

config MTD_NAND_S3C2410_HWECC
	bool "S3C2410 NAND Hardware ECC"
	depends on MTD_NAND_S3C2410
	help
	  Enable the use of the S3C2410's internal ECC generator when
	  using NAND. Early versions of the chip have had problems with
	  incorrect ECC generation, and if using these, the default of
	  software ECC is preferable.

	  If you lay down a device with the hardware ECC, then you will
	  currently not be able to switch to software, as there is no
	  implementation for ECC method used by the S3C2410

config MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP
	tristate "DiskOnChip 2000, Millennium and Millennium Plus (NAND reimplementation) (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on MTD_NAND && EXPERIMENTAL
	select REED_SOLOMON
	select REED_SOLOMON_DEC16
	help
	  This is a reimplementation of M-Systems DiskOnChip 2000,
	  Millennium and Millennium Plus as a standard NAND device driver,
	  as opposed to the earlier self-contained MTD device drivers.
	  This should enable, among other things, proper JFFS2 operation on
	  these devices.

config MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_ADVANCED
        bool "Advanced detection options for DiskOnChip"
        depends on MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP
        help
          This option allows you to specify nonstandard address at which to
          probe for a DiskOnChip, or to change the detection options.  You
          are unlikely to need any of this unless you are using LinuxBIOS.
          Say 'N'.

config MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_ADDRESS
        hex "Physical address of DiskOnChip" if MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_ADVANCED
        depends on MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP
        default "0"
        ---help---
        By default, the probe for DiskOnChip devices will look for a
        DiskOnChip at every multiple of 0x2000 between 0xC8000 and 0xEE000.
        This option allows you to specify a single address at which to probe
        for the device, which is useful if you have other devices in that
        range which get upset when they are probed.

        (Note that on PowerPC, the normal probe will only check at
        0xE4000000.)

        Normally, you should leave this set to zero, to allow the probe at
        the normal addresses.

config MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_HIGH
        bool "Probe high addresses"
        depends on MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_ADVANCED
        help
          By default, the probe for DiskOnChip devices will look for a
          DiskOnChip at every multiple of 0x2000 between 0xC8000 and 0xEE000.
          This option changes to make it probe between 0xFFFC8000 and
          0xFFFEE000.  Unless you are using LinuxBIOS, this is unlikely to be
          useful to you.  Say 'N'.

config MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_BBTWRITE
	bool "Allow BBT writes on DiskOnChip Millennium and 2000TSOP"
	depends on MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP
	help
	  On DiskOnChip devices shipped with the INFTL filesystem (Millennium
	  and 2000 TSOP/Alon), Linux reserves some space at the end of the
	  device for the Bad Block Table (BBT).  If you have existing INFTL
	  data on your device (created by non-Linux tools such as M-Systems'
	  DOS drivers), your data might overlap the area Linux wants to use for
	  the BBT.  If this is a concern for you, leave this option disabled and
	  Linux will not write BBT data into this area.
	  The downside of leaving this option disabled is that if bad blocks
	  are detected by Linux, they will not be recorded in the BBT, which
	  could cause future problems.
	  Once you enable this option, new filesystems (INFTL or others, created
	  in Linux or other operating systems) will not use the reserved area.
	  The only reason not to enable this option is to prevent damage to
	  preexisting filesystems.
	  Even if you leave this disabled, you can enable BBT writes at module
	  load time (assuming you build diskonchip as a module) with the module
	  parameter "inftl_bbt_write=1".

config MTD_NAND_SHARPSL
	tristate "Support for NAND Flash on Sharp SL Series (C7xx + others)"
	depends on MTD_NAND && ARCH_PXA

config MTD_NAND_CS553X
	tristate "NAND support for CS5535/CS5536 (AMD Geode companion chip)"
	depends on MTD_NAND && X86_PC && PCI
	
config MTD_NAND_NANDSIM
	tristate "Support for NAND Flash Simulator"
	depends on MTD_NAND && MTD_PARTITIONS
	help
	  The simulator may simulate verious NAND flash chips for the
	  MTD nand layer.
