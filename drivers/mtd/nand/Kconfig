config MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE
	bool "Verify NAND page writes"
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  NAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentally due to device wear or something else.

config MTD_NAND_ECC_SMC
	bool "NAND ECC Smart Media byte order"
	default n
	help
	  Software ECC according to the Smart Media Specification.

	depends on MTD_NAND
	default n
	help
	  Enable this option only when your board has first generation
	  NAND chips (page size 256 byte, erase size 4-8KiB). The IDs
	  of these chips were reused by later, larger chips.

	tristate "Blackfin on-chip NAND Flash Controller driver"
	depends on (BF54x || BF52x) && MTD_NAND
	help
	  This enables the Blackfin on-chip NAND flash controller

	  No board specific support is done by this driver, each board
	  must advertise a platform_device for the driver to attach.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called bf5xx-nand.

	depends on MTD_NAND_S3C2410
	help
	  Enable the use of the S3C2410's internal ECC generator when
	  using NAND. Early versions of the chip have had problems with

	  Stop the clock to the NAND controller when there is no chip

	tristate "DiskOnChip 2000, Millennium and Millennium Plus (NAND reimplementation) (EXPERIMENTAL)"

	select REED_SOLOMON_DEC16
	help
	  This is a reimplementation of M-Systems DiskOnChip 2000,
	  Millennium and Millennium Plus as a standard NAND device driver,
	  as opposed to the earlier self-contained MTD device drivers.
	  This should enable, among other things, proper JFFS2 operation on
	  these devices.

config MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_ADVANCED
        bool "Advanced detection options for DiskOnChip"
        depends on MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP
        help
          This option allows you to specify nonstandard address at which to
          probe for a DiskOnChip, or to change the detection options.  You
          are unlikely to need any of this unless you are using LinuxBIOS.
          Say 'N'.

config MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_ADDRESS
        hex "Physical address of DiskOnChip" if MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_ADVANCED
        depends on MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP
        default "0"
        ---help---
        By default, the probe for DiskOnChip devices will look for a
        DiskOnChip at every multiple of 0x2000 between 0xC8000 and 0xEE000.
        This option allows you to specify a single address at which to probe
        for the device, which is useful if you have other devices in that
        range which get upset when they are probed.

        (Note that on PowerPC, the normal probe will only check at
        0xE4000000.)

        Normally, you should leave this set to zero, to allow the probe at
        the normal addresses.

config MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_HIGH
        bool "Probe high addresses"
        depends on MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_ADVANCED
        help
          By default, the probe for DiskOnChip devices will look for a
          DiskOnChip at every multiple of 0x2000 between 0xC8000 and 0xEE000.
          This option changes to make it probe between 0xFFFC8000 and
          0xFFFEE000.  Unless you are using LinuxBIOS, this is unlikely to be
          useful to you.  Say 'N'.

config MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_BBTWRITE
	bool "Allow BBT writes on DiskOnChip Millennium and 2000TSOP"
	depends on MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP
	help
	  On DiskOnChip devices shipped with the INFTL filesystem (Millennium
	  and 2000 TSOP/Alon), Linux reserves some space at the end of the
	  device for the Bad Block Table (BBT).  If you have existing INFTL
	  data on your device (created by non-Linux tools such as M-Systems'
	  DOS drivers), your data might overlap the area Linux wants to use for
	  the BBT.  If this is a concern for you, leave this option disabled and
	  Linux will not write BBT data into this area.
	  The downside of leaving this option disabled is that if bad blocks
	  are detected by Linux, they will not be recorded in the BBT, which
	  could cause future problems.
	  Once you enable this option, new filesystems (INFTL or others, created
	  in Linux or other operating systems) will not use the reserved area.
	  The only reason not to enable this option is to prevent damage to
	  preexisting filesystems.
	  Even if you leave this disabled, you can enable BBT writes at module
	  load time (assuming you build diskonchip as a module) with the module
	  parameter "inftl_bbt_write=1".

config MTD_NAND_SHARPSL
	tristate "Support for NAND Flash on Sharp SL Series (C7xx + others)"

config MTD_NAND_BASLER_EXCITE
	tristate  "Support for NAND Flash on Basler eXcite"
	depends on BASLER_EXCITE
	help
          This enables the driver for the NAND flash device found on the
          Basler eXcite Smart Camera. If built as a module, the driver
          will be named "excite_nandflash.ko".

config MTD_NAND_CAFE
	tristate "NAND support for OLPC CAFÉ chip"
	depends on PCI
	select REED_SOLOMON
	select REED_SOLOMON_DEC16
	help
	  Use NAND flash attached to the CAFÉ chip designed for the OLPC
	  laptop.

config MTD_NAND_CS553X
	tristate "NAND support for CS5535/CS5536 (AMD Geode companion chip)"
	depends on X86_32 && (X86_PC || X86_GENERICARCH)
	help
	  The CS553x companion chips for the AMD Geode processor
	  include NAND flash controllers with built-in hardware ECC
	  capabilities; enabling this option will allow you to use
	  these. The driver will check the MSRs to verify that the
	  controller is enabled for NAND, and currently requires that
	  the controller be in MMIO mode.

	  If you say "m", the module will be called "cs553x_nand.ko".

config MTD_NAND_AT91
	bool "Support for NAND Flash / SmartMedia on AT91"

	  MTD nand layer.

config MTD_NAND_PLATFORM
	tristate "Support for generic platform NAND driver"
	depends on MTD_NAND
	help
	  This implements a generic NAND driver for on-SOC platform
	  devices. You will need to provide platform-specific functions
	  via platform_data.

config MTD_ALAUDA
	tristate "MTD driver for Olympus MAUSB-10 and Fujifilm DPC-R1"
	depends on MTD_NAND && USB
	help
	  These two (and possibly other) Alauda-based cardreaders for
	  SmartMedia and xD allow raw flash access.

config MTD_NAND_ORION
	tristate "NAND Flash support for Marvell Orion SoC"
	depends on PLAT_ORION && MTD_NAND

	depends on MTD_NAND && PPC_OF
	help
	  Various Freescale chips, including the 8313, include a NAND Flash
	  Controller Module with built-in hardware ECC capabilities.
	  Enabling this option will enable you to use this to control
	  external NAND devices.
