	select VIRTUALIZATION

config OMAP_REMOTEPROC
	tristate "OMAP remoteproc support"
	depends on HAS_DMA
	depends on ARCH_OMAP4 || SOC_OMAP5
	depends on OMAP_IOMMU
	select REMOTEPROC
	select MAILBOX
	select OMAP2PLUS_MBOX
	select RPMSG
	help
	  Say y here to support OMAP's remote processors (dual M3
	  and DSP on OMAP4) via the remote processor framework.

	  Currently only supported on OMAP4.

	  Usually you want to say y here, in order to enable multimedia
	  use-cases to run on your platform (multimedia codecs are
	  offloaded to remote DSP processors using this framework).

	  It's safe to say n here if you're not interested in multimedia
	  offloading or just want a bare minimum kernel.

config STE_MODEM_RPROC
	tristate "STE-Modem remoteproc support"
	depends on HAS_DMA
	select REMOTEPROC
	default n
	help
	  Say y or m here to support STE-Modem shared memory driver.
	  This can be either built-in or a loadable module.
	  If unsure say N.

config WKUP_M3_RPROC
	tristate "AMx3xx Wakeup M3 remoteproc support"
	depends on SOC_AM33XX || SOC_AM43XX
	select REMOTEPROC
	help
	  Say y here to support Wakeup M3 remote processor on TI AM33xx
	  and AM43xx family of SoCs.

	  Required for Suspend-to-RAM on AM33xx and AM43xx SoCs. Also needed
	  for deep CPUIdle states on AM33xx SoCs. Allows for loading of the
	  firmware onto these remote processors.
	  If unsure say N.

config DA8XX_REMOTEPROC
	tristate "DA8xx/OMAP-L13x remoteproc support"
	depends on ARCH_DAVINCI_DA8XX
	select CMA if MMU
	select REMOTEPROC
	select RPMSG
	help
	  Say y here to support DA8xx/OMAP-L13x remote processors via the
	  remote processor framework.

	  You want to say y here in order to enable AMP
	  use-cases to run on your platform (multimedia codecs are
	  offloaded to remote DSP processors using this framework).

	  This module controls the name of the firmware file that gets
	  loaded on the DSP.  This file must reside in the /lib/firmware
	  directory.  It can be specified via the module parameter
	  da8xx_fw_name=<filename>, and if not specified will default to
	  "rproc-dsp-fw".

	  It's safe to say n here if you're not interested in multimedia
	  offloading.

	  Say y here to support the Peripheral Image Loader for the Qualcomm
	  Wireless Connectivity Subsystem.

config ST_REMOTEPROC
	tristate "ST remoteproc support"
	depends on ARCH_STI
	select REMOTEPROC
	help
	  Say y here to support ST's adjunct processors via the remote
	  processor framework.
	  This can be either built-in or a loadable module.
