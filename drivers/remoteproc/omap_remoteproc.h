 * enum - Predefined Mailbox Messages
 *
 * @RP_MBOX_READY: informs the M3's that we're up and running. this is
 * part of the init sequence sent that the M3 expects to see immediately
 * after it is booted.
 *
 * @RP_MBOX_PENDING_MSG: informs the receiver that there is an inbound
 * message waiting in its own receive-side vring. please note that currently
 * this message is optional: alternatively, one can explicitly send the index
 * of the triggered virtqueue itself. the preferred approach will be decided
 * as we progress and experiment with those two different approaches.
 *
 * @RP_MBOX_CRASH: this message is sent if BIOS crashes
 *
 * @RP_MBOX_ECHO_REQUEST: a mailbox-level "ping" message.
 *
 * @RP_MBOX_ECHO_REPLY: a mailbox-level reply to a "ping"
 *
 * @RP_MBOX_ABORT_REQUEST: a "please crash" request, used for testing the
 * recovery mechanism (to some extent).
 *
 * Introduce new message definitions if any here.
 *
 * @RP_MBOX_END_MSG: Indicates end of known/defined messages from remote core
 * This should be the last definition.
