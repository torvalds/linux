	  Say Y here to enable support for the CPR hardware found on Qualcomm
	  SoCs like QCS404.

	  This driver populates CPU OPPs tables and makes adjustments to the
	  tables based on feedback from the CPR hardware. If you want to do
	  CPUfrequency scaling say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called qcom-cpr

	  Say Y here to enable support for the CPR4 hardware found on Qualcomm
	  SoCs like MSM8953, SDM450, SDM632.

	  This driver populates CPU OPPs tables based on fuses specific to CPR
	  hardware. If you want to do CPU frequency scaling say Y here.

	  QCOM RPMh Power domain driver to support power-domains with
	  performance states. The driver communicates a performance state
	  value to RPMh which then translates it into corresponding voltage
	  for the voltage rail.
