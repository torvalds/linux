config MFD_SM501
	tristate "Support for Silicon Motion SM501"
	 ---help---
	  This is the core driver for the Silicon Motion SM501 multimedia
	  companion chip. This device is a multifunction device which may
	  provide numerous interfaces including USB host controller, USB gadget,
	  asynchronous serial ports, audio functions, and a dual display video
	  interface. The device may be connected by PCI or local bus with
	  varying functions enabled.

config MFD_SM501_GPIO
	bool "Export GPIO via GPIO layer"
	depends on MFD_SM501 && GPIOLIB
	 ---help---
	 This option uses the gpio library layer to export the 64 GPIO
	 lines on the SM501. The platform data is used to supply the
	 base number for the first GPIO line to register.

config MFD_ASIC3
	bool "Support for Compaq ASIC3"

	 ---help---
	  This driver supports the ASIC3 multifunction chip found on many
	  PDAs (mainly iPAQ and HTC based ones)

config HTC_EGPIO
	bool "HTC EGPIO support"
	depends on GENERIC_HARDIRQS && GPIOLIB && ARM
	help
	    This driver supports the CPLD egpio chip present on
	    several HTC phones.  It provides basic support for input
	    pins, output pins, and irqs.

config HTC_PASIC3
	tristate "HTC PASIC3 LED/DS1WM chip support"
	help
	  This core driver provides register access for the LED/DS1WM
	  chips labeled "AIC2" and "AIC3", found on HTC Blueangel and
	  HTC Magician devices, respectively. Actual functionality is
	  handled by the leds-pasic3 and ds1wm drivers.
