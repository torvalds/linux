config FDDI

	depends on PCI || EISA || TC
	help
	  Fiber Distributed Data Interface is a high speed local area network
	  design; essentially a replacement for high speed Ethernet. FDDI can
	  run over copper or fiber. If you are connected to such a network and
	  want a driver for the FDDI card in your computer, say Y here (and
	  then also Y to the driver for your FDDI card, below). Most people
	  will say N.

if FDDI

config DEFZA
	tristate "DEC FDDIcontroller 700/700-C (DEFZA-xx) support"
	depends on FDDI && TC
	help
	  This is support for the DEC FDDIcontroller 700 (DEFZA-AA, fiber)
	  and 700-C (DEFZA-CA, copper) TURBOchannel network cards which
	  can connect you to a local FDDI network.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called defza.  If unsure, say N.

config DEFXX
	tristate "Digital DEFTA/DEFEA/DEFPA adapter support"
	depends on FDDI && (PCI || EISA || TC)
	help
	  This is support for the DIGITAL series of TURBOchannel (DEFTA),
	  EISA (DEFEA) and PCI (DEFPA) controllers which can connect you
	  to a local FDDI network.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called defxx.  If unsure, say N.

config DEFXX_MMIO
	bool
	prompt "Use MMIO instead of PIO" if PCI || EISA
	depends on DEFXX
	default n if PCI || EISA
	default y
	help
	  This instructs the driver to use EISA or PCI memory-mapped I/O
	  (MMIO) as appropriate instead of programmed I/O ports (PIO).
	  Enabling this gives an improvement in processing time in parts
	  of the driver, but it may cause problems with EISA (DEFEA)
	  adapters.  TURBOchannel does not have the concept of I/O ports,
	  so MMIO is always used for these (DEFTA) adapters.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SKFP
	tristate "SysKonnect FDDI PCI support"
	depends on FDDI && PCI
	select BITREVERSE
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a SysKonnect FDDI PCI adapter.
	  The following adapters are supported by this driver:
	  - SK-5521 (SK-NET FDDI-UP)
	  - SK-5522 (SK-NET FDDI-UP DAS)
	  - SK-5541 (SK-NET FDDI-FP)
	  - SK-5543 (SK-NET FDDI-LP)
	  - SK-5544 (SK-NET FDDI-LP DAS)
	  - SK-5821 (SK-NET FDDI-UP64)
	  - SK-5822 (SK-NET FDDI-UP64 DAS)
	  - SK-5841 (SK-NET FDDI-FP64)
	  - SK-5843 (SK-NET FDDI-LP64)
	  - SK-5844 (SK-NET FDDI-LP64 DAS)
	  - Netelligent 100 FDDI DAS Fibre SC
	  - Netelligent 100 FDDI SAS Fibre SC
	  - Netelligent 100 FDDI DAS UTP
	  - Netelligent 100 FDDI SAS UTP
	  - Netelligent 100 FDDI SAS Fibre MIC

	  Read <file:Documentation/networking/skfp.rst> for information about
	  the driver.

	  Questions concerning this driver can be addressed to:
	  <linux@syskonnect.de>

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called skfp.  This is recommended.
