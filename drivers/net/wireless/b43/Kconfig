	  b43 is a driver for the Broadcom 43xx series wireless devices.

	  Check "lspci" for something like
	  "Broadcom Corporation BCM43XX 802.11 Wireless LAN Controller"
	  to determine whether you own such a device.

	  This driver supports the new BCM43xx IEEE 802.11G devices, but not
	  the old IEEE 802.11B devices. Old devices are supported by
	  the b43legacy driver.
	  Note that this has nothing to do with the standard that your AccessPoint
	  supports (A, B, G or a combination).
	  IEEE 802.11G devices can talk to IEEE 802.11B AccessPoints.

	  It is safe to include both b43 and b43legacy as the underlying glue
	  layer will automatically load the correct version for your device.

	  This driver uses V4 firmware, which must be installed separately using
	  b43-fwcutter.

	  This driver can be built as a module (recommended) that will be called "b43".
	  If unsure, say M.

	---help---
	  Broadcom 43xx PCMCIA device support.

	  Support for 16bit PCMCIA devices.
	  Please note that most PC-CARD devices are _NOT_ 16bit PCMCIA
	  devices, but 32bit CardBUS devices. CardBUS devices are supported
	  out of the box by b43.

	  With this config option you can drive b43 cards in
	  CompactFlash formfactor in a PCMCIA adaptor.
	  CF b43 cards can sometimes be found in handheld PCs.

	  It's safe to select Y here, even if you don't have a B43 PCMCIA device.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  Support for the IEEE 802.11n draft.

	  SAY N.

config B43_PHY_LP
	bool "IEEE 802.11g LP-PHY support (BROKEN)"
	depends on B43 && EXPERIMENTAL && BROKEN
	---help---
	  Support for the LP-PHY.
	  The LP-PHY is an IEEE 802.11g based PHY built into some notebooks
	  and embedded devices.

	  THIS IS BROKEN AND DOES NOT WORK YET.

	  SAY N.

	  Broadcom 43xx debugging.

	  This adds additional runtime sanity checks and statistics to the driver.
	  These checks and statistics might me expensive and hurt runtime performance
	  of your system.
	  This also adds the b43 debugfs interface.

	  Do not enable this, unless you are debugging the driver.

	  Say N, if you are a distributor or user building a release kernel
	  for production use.
	  Only say Y, if you are debugging a problem in the b43 driver sourcecode.

config B43_FORCE_PIO
	bool "Force usage of PIO instead of DMA"
	depends on B43 && B43_DEBUG
	---help---
	  This will disable DMA and always enable PIO instead.

	  Say N!
	  This is only for debugging the PIO engine code. You do
	  _NOT_ want to enable this.
