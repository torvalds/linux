			U S E R  M A N U A L

1) FOR DRIVER INSTALL

	a) Copy sd8787.bin to /lib/firmware/mrvl/ directory,
	   create the directory if it doesn't exist.
	b) Install WLAN driver,
		insmod mwifiex.ko
	c) Uninstall WLAN driver,
		ifconfig mlanX down
		rmmod mwifiex


2) FOR DRIVER CONFIGURATION AND INFO
	The configurations can be done either using the 'iw' user space
	utility or debugfs.

	a) 'iw' utility commands

	Following are some useful iw commands:-

iw dev mlan0 scan

	This command will trigger a scan.
	The command will then display the scan table entries

iw dev mlan0 connect -w <SSID> [<freq in MHz>] [<bssid>] [key 0:abcde d:1123456789a]
	The above command can be used to connect to an AP with a particular SSID.
	Ap's operating frequency can be specified or even the bssid. If the AP is using
	WEP encryption, wep keys can be specified in the command.
	Note: Every time before connecting to an AP scan command (iw dev mlan0 scan) should be used by user.

iw dev mlan0 disconnect
	This command will be used to disconnect from an AP.


iw dev mlan0 ibss join <SSID> <freq in MHz> [fixed-freq] [fixed-bssid] [key 0:abcde]
	The command will be used to join or create an ibss. Optionally, operating frequency,
	bssid and the security related parameters can be specified while joining/creating
	and ibss.

iw dev mlan0 ibss leave
	The command will be used to leave an ibss network.

iw dev mlan0 link
	The command will be used to get the connection status. The command will return parameters
	such as SSID, operating frequency, rx/tx packets, signal strength, tx bitrate.

	Apart from the iw utility all standard configurations using the 'iwconfig' utility are also supported.

	b) Debugfs interface

	The debugfs interface can be used for configurations and for getting
	some useful information from the driver.
	The section below explains the configurations that can be
	done.

	Mount debugfs to /debugfs mount point:

		mkdir /debugfs
		mount -t debugfs debugfs /debugfs

	The information is provided in /debugfs/mwifiex/mlanX/:

iw reg set <country code>
	The command will be used to change the regulatory domain.

iw reg get
	The command will be used to get current regulatory domain.

info
	This command is used to get driver info.

	Usage:
		cat info

	driver_name = "mwifiex"

		echo "1 0xa060" > regrdwr           : Read the MAC register
		echo "1 0xa060 0x12" > regrdwr      : Write the MAC register
