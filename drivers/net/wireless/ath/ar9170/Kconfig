	  This driver is going to get replaced by carl9170.

	  This is a driver for the Atheros "otus" 802.11n USB devices.

	  These devices require additional firmware (2 files).
	  For now, these files can be downloaded from here:

	  http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/ar9170

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called ar9170usb.
