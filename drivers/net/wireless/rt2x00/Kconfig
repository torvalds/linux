	  This will enable the support for the Ralink drivers,
	  developed in the rt2x00 project <http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com>.

	  These drivers make use of the mac80211 stack.

	  When building one of the individual drivers, the rt2x00 library
	  will also be created. That library (when the driver is built as
	  a module) will be called rt2x00lib.

	  Additionally PCI and USB libraries will also be build depending
	  on the types of drivers being selected, these libraries will be
	  called rt2x00pci and rt2x00usb.
