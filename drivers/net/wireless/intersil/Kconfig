	  If you have a wireless card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all the
	  questions about these cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	  This enables support for FullMAC PCI/Cardbus prism54 devices. This
	  driver is now deprecated in favor for the SoftMAC driver, p54pci.
	  p54pci supports FullMAC PCI/Cardbus devices as well.

	  For more information refer to the p54 wiki:

	  http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/p54

	  Note: You need a motherboard with DMA support to use any of these cards

	  When built as module you get the module prism54
