	---help---
	  Say Y if you have any pre-802.11 wireless LAN hardware.

	  This option does not affect the kernel build, it only
	  lets you choose drivers.

config STRIP

	depends on INET && WLAN_PRE80211
	select WIRELESS_EXT
	---help---
	  Say Y if you have a Metricom radio and intend to use Starmode Radio
	  IP. STRIP is a radio protocol developed for the MosquitoNet project
	  (on the WWW at <http://mosquitonet.stanford.edu/>) to send Internet
	  traffic using Metricom radios.  Metricom radios are small, battery
	  powered, 100kbit/sec packet radio transceivers, about the size and
	  weight of a cellular telephone. (You may also have heard them called
	  "Metricom modems" but we avoid the term "modem" because it misleads
	  many people into thinking that you can plug a Metricom modem into a
	  phone line and use it as a modem.)

	  You can use STRIP on any Linux machine with a serial port, although
	  it is obviously most useful for people with laptop computers. If you
	  think you might get a Metricom radio in the future, there is no harm
	  in saying Y to STRIP now, except that it makes the kernel a bit
	  bigger.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called strip.

	---help---
	  Aironet makes Arlan, a class of wireless LAN adapters. These use the
	  www.Telxon.com chip, which is also used on several similar cards.
	  This driver is tested on the 655 and IC2200 series cards. Look at
	  <http://www.ylenurme.ee/~elmer/655/> for the latest information.

	  The driver is built as two modules, arlan and arlan-proc. The latter
	  is the /proc interface and is not needed most of time.

	  On some computers the card ends up in non-valid state after some
	  time. Use a ping-reset script to clear it.
