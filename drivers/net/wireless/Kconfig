	---help---
	  Say Y if you have a Metricom radio and intend to use Starmode Radio
	  IP. STRIP is a radio protocol developed for the MosquitoNet project
	  (on the WWW at <http://mosquitonet.stanford.edu/>) to send Internet
	  traffic using Metricom radios.  Metricom radios are small, battery
	  powered, 100kbit/sec packet radio transceivers, about the size and
	  weight of a cellular telephone. (You may also have heard them called
	  "Metricom modems" but we avoid the term "modem" because it misleads
	  many people into thinking that you can plug a Metricom modem into a
	  phone line and use it as a modem.)

	  You can use STRIP on any Linux machine with a serial port, although
	  it is obviously most useful for people with laptop computers. If you
	  think you might get a Metricom radio in the future, there is no harm
	  in saying Y to STRIP now, except that it makes the kernel a bit
	  bigger.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called strip.

	  Aironet makes Arlan, a class of wireless LAN adapters. These use the
	  www.Telxon.com chip, which is also used on several similar cards.
	  This driver is tested on the 655 and IC2200 series cards. Look at
	  <http://www.ylenurme.ee/~elmer/655/> for the latest information.

	  The driver is built as two modules, arlan and arlan-proc. The latter
	  is the /proc interface and is not needed most of time.

	  On some computers the card ends up in non-valid state after some
	  time. Use a ping-reset script to clear it.

	---help---
          A driver for the Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 Network 
	  Connection 802.11b wireless network adapter.

          See <file:Documentation/networking/README.ipw2100> for information on
          the capabilities currently enabled in this driver and for tips
          for debugging issues and problems.

	  In order to use this driver, you will need a firmware image for it.
          You can obtain the firmware from
	  <http://ipw2100.sf.net/>.  Once you have the firmware image, you 
	  will need to place it in /lib/firmware.

          You will also very likely need the Wireless Tools in order to
          configure your card:

          <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>.

          It is recommended that you compile this driver as a module (M)
          rather than built-in (Y). This driver requires firmware at device
          initialization time, and when built-in this typically happens
          before the filesystem is accessible (hence firmware will be
          unavailable and initialization will fail). If you do choose to build
          this driver into your kernel image, you can avoid this problem by
          including the firmware and a firmware loader in an initramfs.
 
config IPW2100_MONITOR

        depends on IPW2100
        ---help---
	  Enables promiscuous/monitor mode support for the ipw2100 driver.
	  With this feature compiled into the driver, you can switch to

	  mode, no packets can be sent.

config IPW2100_DEBUG
	bool "Enable full debugging output in IPW2100 module."
	depends on IPW2100
	---help---
	  This option will enable debug tracing output for the IPW2100.  

	  This will result in the kernel module being ~60k larger.  You can 
	  control which debug output is sent to the kernel log by setting the 
	  value in 

	  /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ipw2100/debug_level

	  This entry will only exist if this option is enabled.

	  If you are not trying to debug or develop the IPW2100 driver, you 
	  most likely want to say N here.

	  Enables promiscuous/monitor mode support for the ipw2200 driver.

	---help---
          Enables the creation of a second interface prefixed 'rtap'. 
          This second interface will provide every received in radiotap
	  format.

          This is useful for performing wireless network analysis while
          maintaining an active association.

          Example usage:

            % modprobe ipw2200 rtap_iface=1
            % ifconfig rtap0 up
            % tethereal -i rtap0

          If you do not specify 'rtap_iface=1' as a module parameter then 
          the rtap interface will not be created and you will need to turn 
          it on via sysfs:
	
            % echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ipw2200/*/rtap_iface

	---help---
	  This option will enable low level debug tracing output for IPW2200.

	  Note, normal debug code is already compiled in. This low level
	  debug option enables debug on hot paths (e.g Tx, Rx, ISR) and
	  will result in the kernel module being ~70 larger.  Most users
	  will typically not need this high verbosity debug information.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.

	  BUFFALO WLI-USB-G54

	  All of these devices are based on Broadcom 4320 chip which is the
	  only wireless RNDIS chip known to date.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called rndis_wlan.

	  However, some of these cards have been replaced with other chips
	  like the RTL8180L (Xterasys Cardbus XN-2411b, Belkin F5D6001) or
	  the Ralink RT2400 (SMC2635W) without a model number change.

	  Thanks to Infineon-ADMtek for their support of this driver.

config MAC80211_HWSIM
	tristate "Simulated radio testing tool for mac80211"
	depends on MAC80211 && WLAN_80211
	---help---
	  This driver is a developer testing tool that can be used to test
	  IEEE 802.11 networking stack (mac80211) functionality. This is not
	  needed for normal wireless LAN usage and is only for testing. See
	  Documentation/networking/mac80211_hwsim for more information on how
	  to use this tool.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called mac80211_hwsim.  If unsure, say N.
