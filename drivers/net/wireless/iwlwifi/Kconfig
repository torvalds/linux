config IWLWIFI
	bool "Intel Wireless WiFi Link Drivers"
	depends on PCI && MAC80211 && WLAN_80211 && EXPERIMENTAL
	select FW_LOADER
	default n
	---help---
	  Select to enable drivers based on the iwlwifi project.  This
	  project provides a common foundation for Intel's wireless
	  drivers designed to use the mac80211 subsystem.

	  See <file:Documentation/networking/README.iwlwifi> for
	  information on the capabilities currently enabled in this
	  driver and for tips for debugging issues and problems.

config IWLWIFI_DEBUG
	bool "Enable full debugging output in iwlwifi drivers"
	depends on IWLWIFI
	default y
	---help---
	  This option will enable debug tracing output for the iwlwifi
	  drivers.

	  This will result in the kernel module being ~100k larger.  You can
	  control which debug output is sent to the kernel log by setting the
	  value in

	          /sys/bus/pci/drivers/${DRIVER}/debug_level

	  This entry will only exist if this option is enabled.

	  To set a value, simply echo an 8-byte hex value to the same file:

		  % echo 0x43fff > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/${DRIVER}/debug_level

	  You can find the list of debug mask values in:
		  drivers/net/wireless/mac80211/iwlwifi/iwl-debug.h

	  If this is your first time using this driver, you should say Y here
	  as the debug information can assist others in helping you resolve
	  any problems you may encounter.

config IWLWIFI_SENSITIVITY
	bool "Enable Sensitivity Calibration in iwlwifi drivers"
	depends on IWLWIFI
	default y
	---help---
	  This option will enable sensitivity calibration for the iwlwifi
	  drivers.

config IWLWIFI_SPECTRUM_MEASUREMENT
	bool "Enable Spectrum Measurement in iwlwifi drivers"
	depends on IWLWIFI
	default y
	---help---
	  This option will enable spectrum measurement for the iwlwifi drivers.

config IWLWIFI_QOS
	bool "Enable Wireless QoS in iwlwifi drivers"
	depends on IWLWIFI
	default y
	---help---
	  This option will enable wireless quality of service (QoS) for the
	  iwlwifi drivers.

config IWLWIFI_HT
	bool "Enable 802.11n HT features in iwlwifi drivers"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	depends on IWLWIFI && MAC80211_HT
	default n
	---help---
	  This option enables IEEE 802.11n High Throughput features
	  for the iwlwifi drivers.

config IWL4965
	tristate "Intel Wireless WiFi 4965AGN"
	depends on m && IWLWIFI && EXPERIMENTAL
	default m
	---help---
	  Select to build the driver supporting the:

	  Intel Wireless WiFi Link 4965AGN

	  This driver uses the kernel's mac80211 subsystem.

	  See <file:Documentation/networking/README.iwlwifi> for
	  information on the capabilities currently enabled in this
	  driver and for tips for debugging any issues or problems.

	  In order to use this driver, you will need a microcode (uCode)
	  image for it. You can obtain the microcode from:

	          <http://intellinuxwireless.org/>.

	  See the above referenced README.iwlwifi for information on where
	  to install the microcode images.

	  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and remvoed from the running kernel whenever you want),
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
	  will be called iwl4965.ko.

config IWL3945
	tristate "Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG/BG Network Connection"
	depends on m && IWLWIFI && EXPERIMENTAL
	default m
	---help---
	  Select to build the driver supporting the:

	  Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG/BG Network Connection

	  This driver uses the kernel's mac80211 subsystem.
