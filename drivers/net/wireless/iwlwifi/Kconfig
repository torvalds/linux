	  Select to build the driver supporting the:

	  Intel Wireless WiFi Link 4965AGN

	  This driver uses the kernel's mac80211 subsystem.

	  In order to use this driver, you will need a microcode (uCode)
	  image for it. You can obtain the microcode from:

	          <http://intellinuxwireless.org/>.

	  The microcode is typically installed in /lib/firmware. You can
	  look in the hotplug script /etc/hotplug/firmware.agent to
	  determine which directory FIRMWARE_DIR is set to when the script
	  runs.

	  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt>.  The
	  module will be called iwl4965.ko.

config IWL4965_SPECTRUM_MEASUREMENT

	  driver.

config IWLWIFI_DEBUG
	bool "Enable full debugging output in iwl4965 driver"
	depends on IWL4965
	---help---
	  This option will enable debug tracing output for the iwl4965
	  driver.

	  This will result in the kernel module being ~100k larger.  You can
	  control which debug output is sent to the kernel log by setting the
	  value in

	          /sys/bus/pci/drivers/${DRIVER}/debug_level

	  This entry will only exist if this option is enabled.

	  To set a value, simply echo an 8-byte hex value to the same file:

		  % echo 0x43fff > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/${DRIVER}/debug_level

	  You can find the list of debug mask values in:
		  drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-4965-debug.h

	  If this is your first time using this driver, you should say Y here
	  as the debug information can assist others in helping you resolve
	  any problems you may encounter.
