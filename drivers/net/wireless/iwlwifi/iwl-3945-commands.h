/*
 * REPLY_SCAN_CMD = 0x80 (command)
 *
 * The hardware scan command is very powerful; the driver can set it up to
 * maintain (relatively) normal network traffic while doing a scan in the
 * background.  The max_out_time and suspend_time control the ratio of how
 * long the device stays on an associated network channel ("service channel")
 * vs. how long it's away from the service channel, tuned to other channels
 * for scanning.
 *
 * max_out_time is the max time off-channel (in usec), and suspend_time
 * is how long (in "extended beacon" format) that the scan is "suspended"
 * after returning to the service channel.  That is, suspend_time is the
 * time that we stay on the service channel, doing normal work, between
 * scan segments.  The driver may set these parameters differently to support
 * scanning when associated vs. not associated, and light vs. heavy traffic
 * loads when associated.
 *
 * After receiving this command, the device's scan engine does the following;
 *
 * 1)  Sends SCAN_START notification to driver
 * 2)  Checks to see if it has time to do scan for one channel
 * 3)  Sends NULL packet, with power-save (PS) bit set to 1,
 *     to tell AP that we're going off-channel
 * 4)  Tunes to first channel in scan list, does active or passive scan
 * 5)  Sends SCAN_RESULT notification to driver
 * 6)  Checks to see if it has time to do scan on *next* channel in list
 * 7)  Repeats 4-6 until it no longer has time to scan the next channel
 *     before max_out_time expires
 * 8)  Returns to service channel
 * 9)  Sends NULL packet with PS=0 to tell AP that we're back
 * 10) Stays on service channel until suspend_time expires
 * 11) Repeats entire process 2-10 until list is complete
 * 12) Sends SCAN_COMPLETE notification
 *
 * For fast, efficient scans, the scan command also has support for staying on
 * a channel for just a short time, if doing active scanning and getting no
 * responses to the transmitted probe request.  This time is controlled by
 * quiet_time, and the number of received packets below which a channel is
 * considered "quiet" is controlled by quiet_plcp_threshold.
 *
 * For active scanning on channels that have regulatory restrictions against
 * blindly transmitting, the scan can listen before transmitting, to make sure
 * that there is already legitimate activity on the channel.  If enough
 * packets are cleanly received on the channel (controlled by good_CRC_th,
 * typical value 1), the scan engine starts transmitting probe requests.
 *
 * Driver must use separate scan commands for 2.4 vs. 5 GHz bands.
 *
 * To avoid uCode errors, see timing restrictions described under
 * struct iwl3945_scan_channel.
