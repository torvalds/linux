# In case of madwifi, atheros, and nl80211 driver interfaces, an additional
# configuration parameter, bridge, may be used to notify hostapd if the
# interface is included in a bridge. This parameter is not used with Host AP
# driver. If the bridge parameter is not set, the drivers will automatically
# figure out the bridge interface (assuming sysfs is enabled and mounted to
# /sys) and this parameter may not be needed.
#
# For nl80211, this parameter can be used to request the AP interface to be
# added to the bridge automatically (brctl may refuse to do this before hostapd
# has been started to change the interface mode). If needed, the bridge
# interface is also created.

# from external programs (CLI/GUI, etc.) for status information and
# configuration. The socket file will be named based on the interface name, so
# multiple hostapd processes/interfaces can be run at the same time if more

# Access control for the control interface can be configured by setting the

# configuration and open raw sockets) and still allow GUI/CLI components to be
# run as non-root users. However, since the control interface can be used to
# change the network configuration, this access needs to be protected in many
# cases. By default, hostapd is configured to use gid 0 (root). If you
# want to allow non-root users to use the contron interface, add a new group
# and change this value to match with that group. Add users that should have
# control interface access to this group.

##### Integrated EAP server ###################################################

# Optionally, hostapd can be configured to use an integrated EAP server

# for IEEE 802.1X/EAPOL and as a RADIUS server for other devices.

# Use integrated EAP server instead of external RADIUS authentication

# authentication server.

# This may point to the same file as server_cert if both certificate and key

# Enable CRL verification.
# Note: hostapd does not yet support CRL downloading based on CDP. Thus, a
# valid CRL signed by the CA is required to be included in the ca_cert file.
# This can be done by using PEM format for CA certificate and CRL and

# This is an optional configuration file for setting parameters for an

# ephemeral DH key exchange. In addition, ciphers with DSA keys always use
# ephemeral DH keys. This can be used to achieve forward secrecy. If the file
# is in DSA parameters format, it will be automatically converted into DH
# params. This parameter is required if anonymous EAP-FAST is used.

# WPS state

# Whether to manage this interface independently from other WPS interfaces
# By default, a single hostapd process applies WPS operations to all configured
# interfaces. This parameter can be used to disable that behavior for a subset
# of interfaces. If this is set to non-zero for an interface, WPS commands
# issued on that interface do not apply to other interfaces and WPS operations
# performed on other interfaces do not affect this interface.
#wps_independent=0

# AP can be configured into a locked state where new WPS Registrar are not
# accepted, but previously authorized Registrars (including the internal one)
# can continue to add new Enrollees.
#ap_setup_locked=1

# Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID; see RFC 4122) of the device
# This value is used as the UUID for the internal WPS Registrar. If the AP
# is also using UPnP, this value should be set to the device's UPnP UUID.
# If not configured, UUID will be generated based on the local MAC address.
#uuid=12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0

# Note: If wpa_psk_file is set, WPS is used to generate random, per-device PSKs
# that will be appended to the wpa_psk_file. If wpa_psk_file is not set, the
# default PSK (wpa_psk/wpa_passphrase) will be delivered to Enrollees. Use of
# per-device PSKs is recommended as the more secure option (i.e., make sure to
# set wpa_psk_file when using WPS with WPA-PSK).

# When an Enrollee requests access to the network with PIN method, the Enrollee
# PIN will need to be entered for the Registrar. PIN request notifications are
# sent to hostapd ctrl_iface monitor. In addition, they can be written to a
# text file that could be used, e.g., to populate the AP administration UI with
# pending PIN requests. If the following variable is set, the PIN requests will
# be written to the configured file.

# WPS capability discovery workaround for PBC with Windows 7
# Windows 7 uses incorrect way of figuring out AP's WPS capabilities by acting
# as a Registrar and using M1 from the AP. The config methods attribute in that
# message is supposed to indicate only the configuration method supported by
# the AP in Enrollee role, i.e., to add an external Registrar. For that case,
# PBC shall not be used and as such, the PushButton config method is removed
# from M1 by default. If pbc_in_m1=1 is included in the configuration file,
# the PushButton config method is left in M1 (if included in config_methods
# parameter) to allow Windows 7 to use PBC instead of PIN (e.g., from a label
# in the AP).
#pbc_in_m1=1

# Static access point PIN for initial configuration and adding Registrars
# If not set, hostapd will not allow external WPS Registrars to control the
# access point. The AP PIN can also be set at runtime with hostapd_cli
# wps_ap_pin command. Use of temporary (enabled by user action) and random
# AP PIN is much more secure than configuring a static AP PIN here. As such,
# use of the ap_pin parameter is not recommended if the AP device has means for
# displaying a random PIN.

# automatically generated based on network configuration. This configuration

# Note: With wps_cred_processing=1, skip_cred_build should be set to 1 and

#
# wps_cred_processing=1 will disabled automatic updates of hostapd.conf file
# both for Credential processing and for marking AP Setup Locked based on
# validation failures of AP PIN. An external program is responsible on updating
# the configuration appropriately in this case.

# AP Settings Attributes for M7
# By default, hostapd generates the AP Settings Attributes for M7 based on the

##### Multiple BSSID support ##################################################
#
# Above configuration is using the default interface (wlan#, or multi-SSID VLAN
# interfaces). Other BSSIDs can be added by using separator 'bss' with
# default interface name to be allocated for the data packets of the new BSS.
#
# hostapd will generate BSSID mask based on the BSSIDs that are
# configured. hostapd will verify that dev_addr & MASK == dev_addr. If this is
# not the case, the MAC address of the radio must be changed before starting
# hostapd (ifconfig wlan0 hw ether <MAC addr>). If a BSSID is configured for
# every secondary BSS, this limitation is not applied at hostapd and other
# masks may be used if the driver supports them (e.g., swap the locally
# administered bit)
#
# BSSIDs are assigned in order to each BSS, unless an explicit BSSID is
# specified using the 'bssid' parameter.
# If an explicit BSSID is specified, it must be chosen such that it:
# - results in a valid MASK that covers it and the dev_addr
# - is not the same as the MAC address of the radio
# - is not the same as any other explicitly specified BSSID
#
# Please note that hostapd uses some of the values configured for the first BSS
# as the defaults for the following BSSes. However, it is recommended that all
# BSSes include explicit configuration of all relevant configuration items.
#
#bss=wlan0_0
#ssid=test2
# most of the above items can be used here (apart from radio interface specific
# items, like channel)

#bss=wlan0_1
#bssid=00:13:10:95:fe:0b
