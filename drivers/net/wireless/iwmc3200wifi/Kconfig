	  The Intel Wireless Multicomm 3200 hardware is a combo
	  card with GPS, Bluetooth, WiMax and 802.11 radios. It
	  runs over SDIO and is typically found on Moorestown
	  based platform. This driver takes care of the 802.11
	  part, which is a fullmac one.

	  If you choose to build it as a module, it'll be called
	  iwmc3200wifi.ko.

config IWM_DEBUG
	bool "Enable full debugging output in iwmc3200wifi"
	depends on IWM && DEBUG_FS
	---help---
	  This option will enable debug tracing and setting for iwm

	  You can set the debug level and module through debugfs. By
	  default all modules are set to the IWL_DL_ERR level.
	  To see the list of debug modules and levels, see iwm/debug.h

	  For example, if you want the full MLME debug output:
	  echo 0xff > /sys/kernel/debug/iwm/phyN/debug/mlme

	  Or, if you want the full debug, for all modules:
	  echo 0xff > /sys/kernel/debug/iwm/phyN/debug/level
	  echo 0xff > /sys/kernel/debug/iwm/phyN/debug/modules
