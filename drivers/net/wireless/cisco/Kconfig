	  If you have a wireless card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about  cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	  This is the standard Linux driver to support Cisco/Aironet ISA and
	  PCI 802.11 wireless cards.
	  It supports the new 802.11b cards from Cisco (Cisco 34X, Cisco 35X
	  - with or without encryption) as well as card before the Cisco
	  acquisition (Aironet 4500, Aironet 4800, Aironet 4800B).

	  This driver support both the standard Linux Wireless Extensions
	  and Cisco proprietary API, so both the Linux Wireless Tools and the
	  Cisco Linux utilities can be used to configure the card.

	  The driver can be compiled as a module and will be named "airo".

	  This is the standard Linux driver to support Cisco/Aironet PCMCIA
	  802.11 wireless cards.  This driver is the same as the Aironet
	  driver part of the Linux Pcmcia package.
	  It supports the new 802.11b cards from Cisco (Cisco 34X, Cisco 35X
	  - with or without encryption) as well as card before the Cisco
	  acquisition (Aironet 4500, Aironet 4800, Aironet 4800B). It also
	  supports OEM of Cisco such as the DELL TrueMobile 4800 and Xircom
	  802.11b cards.

	  This driver support both the standard Linux Wireless Extensions
	  and Cisco proprietary API, so both the Linux Wireless Tools and the
