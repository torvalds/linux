	  Supports the MediaTek non-built-in Gigabit Ethernet PHYs.

	  Non-built-in Gigabit Ethernet PHYs include mt7530/mt7531.
	  You may find mt7530 inside mt7621. This driver shares some
	  common operations with MediaTek SoC built-in Gigabit
	  Ethernet PHYs.

	  Supports MediaTek SoC built-in Gigabit Ethernet PHYs.

	  Include support for built-in Ethernet PHYs which are present in
	  the MT7981 and MT7988 SoCs. These PHYs need calibration data
	  present in the SoCs efuse and will dynamically calibrate VCM
	  (common-mode voltage) during startup.
