	depends on PHYLIB=y
	---help---
	  Adds the platform "fixed" MDIO Bus to cover the boards that use
	  PHYs that are not connected to the real MDIO bus.

	  Currently tested with mpc866ads and mpc8349e-mitx.

config MDIO_BITBANG
	tristate "Support for bitbanged MDIO buses"
	help
	  This module implements the MDIO bus protocol in software,
	  for use by low level drivers that export the ability to
	  drive the relevant pins.

	  If in doubt, say N.
