	depends on OF_GPIO && OF_MDIO
	select MDIO_BUS_MUX
	help
	  This module provides a driver for MDIO bus multiplexers that
	  are controlled via GPIO lines.  The multiplexer connects one of
	  several child MDIO busses to a parent bus.  Child bus
	  selection is under the control of GPIO lines.

config MDIO_BUS_MUX_MMIOREG
	tristate "Support for MMIO device-controlled MDIO bus multiplexers"
	depends on OF_MDIO
	select MDIO_BUS_MUX
	help
	  This module provides a driver for MDIO bus multiplexers that
	  are controlled via a simple memory-mapped device, like an FPGA.
	  The multiplexer connects one of several child MDIO busses to a
	  parent bus.  Child bus selection is under the control of one of
	  the FPGA's registers.

	  Currently, only 8-bit registers are supported.
