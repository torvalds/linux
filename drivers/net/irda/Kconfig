comment "SIR device drivers"

config IRTTY_SIR
	tristate "IrTTY (uses Linux serial driver)"
	depends on IRDA
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrTTY line
	  discipline.  To compile it as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called irtty-sir. IrTTY makes it possible to use Linux's
	  own serial driver for all IrDA ports that are 16550 compatible.
	  Most IrDA chips are 16550 compatible so you should probably say Y
	  to this option.  Using IrTTY will however limit the speed of the
	  connection to 115200 bps (IrDA SIR mode).

	  If unsure, say Y.

config DONGLE
	bool "Serial dongle support"
	depends on IRTTY_SIR
	help
	  Say Y here if you have an infrared device that connects to your

comment "Old SIR device drivers"

config IRPORT_SIR
	tristate "IrPORT (IrDA serial driver)"
	depends on IRDA && BROKEN_ON_SMP
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrPORT IrDA device
	  driver.  To compile it as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called irport. IrPORT can be used instead of IrTTY and sometimes
	  this can be better.  One example is if your IrDA port does not
	  have echo-canceling, which will work OK with IrPORT since this
	  driver is working in half-duplex mode only.  You don't need to use
	  irattach with IrPORT, but you just insert it the same way as FIR
	  drivers (insmod irport io=0x3e8 irq=11).  Notice that IrPORT is a
	  SIR device driver which means that speed is limited to 115200 bps.

	  If unsure, say Y.
