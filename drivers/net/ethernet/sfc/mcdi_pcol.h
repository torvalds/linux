 * The client writes its request into MC shared memory, and rings the
 * doorbell. Each request is completed either by the MC writing
 * back into shared memory, or by writing out an event.
 *
 * All MCDI commands support completion by shared memory response. Each
 * request may also contain additional data (accounted for by HEADER.LEN),
 * and some responses may also contain additional data (again, accounted
 * for by HEADER.LEN).
 *
 * Some MCDI commands support completion by event, in which any associated
 * response data is included in the event.
 *
 * The protocol requires one response to be delivered for every request; a
 * request should not be sent unless the response for the previous request
 * has been received (either by polling shared memory, or by receiving
 * an event).

/* The MC can generate events for two reasons:
 *   - To advance a shared memory request if XFLAGS_EVREQ was set

 *     via MC_CMD_LOG_CTRL
 *

 *

 *
 *    0     8         16      24     32
 *   | Seq | Datalen | Errno | Rsvd |
 *
 *   These fields are taken directly out of the standard MCDI header, i.e.,
 *   LEVEL==ERR, Datalen == 0 => Reboot
 *
 * Events can be squirted out of the UART (using LOG_CTRL) without a
 * MCDI header.  An event can be distinguished from a MCDI response by
 * examining the first byte which is 0xc0.  This corresponds to the
 * non-existent MCDI command MC_CMD_DEBUG_LOG.
 *
 *      0         7        8
 *     | command | Resync |     = 0xc0
 *
 * Since the event is written in big-endian byte order, this works
 * providing bits 56-63 of the event are 0xc0.
 *
 *      56     60  63
 *     | Rsvd | Code |    = 0xc0

 * atomic fashion.
 *
 * Production mc firmwares are generally compiled with REBOOT_ON_ASSERT=1,

 * handler, so this is in practise an optional operation. It is still

/* MC_CMD_SENSOR_INFO
 * Returns information about every available sensor.
 *
 * Each sensor has a single (16bit) value, and a corresponding state. The
 * mapping between value and state is nominally determined by the MC, but may
 * be implemented using up to 2 ranges per sensor.
 *
 * This call returns a mask (32bit) of the sensors that are supported by this
 * platform, then an array of sensor information structures, in order of sensor
 * type (but without gaps for unimplemented sensors). Each structure defines
 * the ranges for the corresponding sensor. An unused range is indicated by
 * equal limit values. If one range is used, a value outside that range results
 * in STATE_FATAL. If two ranges are used, a value outside the second range
 * results in STATE_FATAL while a value outside the first and inside the second
 * range results in STATE_WARNING.
 *
 * Sensor masks and sensor information arrays are organised into pages. For
 * backward compatibility, older host software can only use sensors in page 0.
 * Bit 32 in the sensor mask was previously unused, and is no reserved for use
 * as the next page flag.
 *
 * If the request does not contain a PAGE value then firmware will only return
 * page 0 of sensor information, with bit 31 in the sensor mask cleared.
 *
 * If the request contains a PAGE value then firmware responds with the sensor
 * mask and sensor information array for that page of sensors. In this case bit
 * 31 in the mask is set if another page exists.

 * MC_CMD_SENSOR_VALUE_ENTRY_TYPEDEF dword.
 *
 * If the request does not contain the LENGTH field then only sensors 0 to 30
 * are reported, to avoid DMA buffer overflow in older host software. If the
 * sensor reading require more space than the LENGTH allows, then return
 * EINVAL.
 *
 * The MC will send a SENSOREVT event every time any sensor changes state. The
 * driver is responsible for ensuring that it doesn't miss any events. The
 * board will function normally if all sensors are in STATE_OK or
 * STATE_WARNING. Otherwise the board should not be expected to function.

 * sensors is the intersection between the sets of sensors known to the driver
 * and the MC. On Riverhead this command is implemented as a wrapper for

/***********************************/
/* MC_CMD_GET_CLIENT_MAC_ADDRESSES
 * A device reports a set of MAC addresses for each client to use, known as the
 * "permanent MAC addresses". Those MAC addresses are provided by the client's
 * administrator, e.g. via MC_CMD_SET_CLIENT_MAC_ADDRESSES, and are intended as
 * a hint to that client which MAC address its administrator would like to use
 * to identity itself. This API exists solely to allow communication of MAC
 * address from administrator to adminstree, and has no inherent interaction
 * with switching within the device. There is no guarantee that a client will
 * be able to send traffic with a source MAC address taken from the list of MAC
 * address reported, nor is there a guarantee that a client will be able to
 * resource traffic with a destination MAC taken from the list of MAC
 * addresses. Likewise, there is no guarantee that a client will not be able to
 * use a MAC address not present in the list. Restrictions on switching are
 * controlled either through the EVB API if operating in EVB mode, or via MAE
 * rules if host software is directly managing the MAE. In order to allow
 * tenants to use this API whilst a provider is using the EVB API, the MAC
 * addresses reported by MC_CMD_GET_CLIENT_MAC_ADDRESSES will be augmented with
 * any MAC addresses associated with the vPort assigned to the caller. In order
 * to allow tenants to use the EVB API whilst a provider is using this API, if
 * a client queries the MAC addresses for a vPort using the host_evb_port_id
 * EVB_PORT_ASSIGNED, that list of MAC addresses will be augmented with the MAC
 * addresses assigned to the calling client. This query can either be explicit
 * (i.e. MC_CMD_VPORT_GET_MAC_ADDRESSES) or implicit (e.g. creation of a
 * vAdaptor with a NULL/automatic MAC address). Changing the MAC address on a
 * vAdaptor only affects VNIC steering filters; it has no effect on the MAC
 * addresses assigned to the vAdaptor's owner. VirtIO clients behave as EVB
 * clients. On VirtIO device reset, a vAdaptor is created with an automatic MAC
 * address. Querying the VirtIO device's MAC address queries the underlying
 * vAdaptor's MAC address. Setting the VirtIO device's MAC address sets the
 * underlying vAdaptor's MAC addresses.
