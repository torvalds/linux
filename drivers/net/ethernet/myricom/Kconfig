	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say
	  Y and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Myricom cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	---help---
	  This driver supports Myricom Myri-10G Dual Protocol interface in
	  Ethernet mode. If the eeprom on your board is not recent enough,
	  you will need a newer firmware image.
	  You may get this image or more information, at:

	  <http://www.myri.com/scs/download-Myri10GE.html>

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called myri10ge.

config MYRI10GE_DCA
	bool "Direct Cache Access (DCA) Support"
	default y
	depends on MYRI10GE && DCA && !(MYRI10GE=y && DCA=m)
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to use Direct Cache Access (DCA) in the
	  driver.  DCA is a method for warming the CPU cache before data
	  is used, with the intent of lessening the impact of cache misses.
