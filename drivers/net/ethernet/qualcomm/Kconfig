config NET_VENDOR_QUALCOMM
	bool "Qualcomm devices"
	default y
	depends on SPI_MASTER && OF_GPIO
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Qualcomm cards. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_QUALCOMM

config QCA7000
	tristate "Qualcomm Atheros QCA7000 support"
	depends on SPI_MASTER && OF_GPIO
	---help---
	  This SPI protocol driver supports the Qualcomm Atheros QCA7000.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called qcaspi.
