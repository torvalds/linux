config NET_VENDOR_DLINK
	bool "D-Link devices"
	default y
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about D-Link devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_DLINK

config DL2K
	tristate "DL2000/TC902x-based Gigabit Ethernet support"
	depends on PCI
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  This driver supports DL2000/TC902x-based Gigabit ethernet cards,
	  which includes
	  D-Link DGE-550T Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.
	  D-Link DL2000-based Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.
	  Sundance/Tamarack TC902x Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called dl2k.

config SUNDANCE
	tristate "Sundance Alta support"
	depends on PCI
	select CRC32
	select MII
	---help---
	  This driver is for the Sundance "Alta" chip.
	  More specific information and updates are available from
	  <http://www.scyld.com/network/sundance.html>.

config SUNDANCE_MMIO
	bool "Use MMIO instead of PIO"
	depends on SUNDANCE
	---help---
	  Enable memory-mapped I/O for interaction with Sundance NIC registers.
	  Do NOT enable this by default, PIO (enabled when MMIO is disabled)
	  is known to solve bugs on certain chips.

	  If unsure, say N.
