	  say Y and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver also works for the following NE2000 clone cards:
	  RealTek RTL-8029  Winbond 89C940  Compex RL2000  KTI ET32P2
	  NetVin NV5000SC   Via 86C926      SureCom NE34   Winbond

	  will NOT WORK for NE3200 cards as they are completely different.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called ne3210.

config PCMCIA_PCNET
	tristate "NE2000 compatible PCMCIA support"

	  Important: There have been many reports that, with some motherboards
	  mixing an SMC Ultra and an Adaptec AHA154x SCSI card (or compatible,
	  such as some BusLogic models) causes corruption problems with many
	  operating systems. The Linux smc-ultra driver has a work-around for
