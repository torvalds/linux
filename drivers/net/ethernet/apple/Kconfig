config NET_VENDOR_APPLE
	bool "Apple devices"
	default y
	depends on (PPC_PMAC && PPC32) || MAC || ISA || EISA || MACH_IXDP2351 \
		   || ARCH_IXDP2X01 || MACH_MX31ADS || MACH_QQ2440
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about IBM devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_APPLE

config MACE
	tristate "MACE (Power Mac ethernet) support"
	depends on PPC_PMAC && PPC32
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  Power Macintoshes and clones with Ethernet built-in on the
	  motherboard will usually use a MACE (Medium Access Control for
	  Ethernet) interface. Say Y to include support for the MACE chip.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called mace.

config MACE_AAUI_PORT
	bool "Use AAUI port instead of TP by default"
	depends on MACE
	---help---
	  Some Apple machines (notably the Apple Network Server) which use the
	  MACE ethernet chip have an Apple AUI port (small 15-pin connector),
	  instead of an 8-pin RJ45 connector for twisted-pair ethernet.  Say
	  Y here if you have such a machine.  If unsure, say N.
	  The driver will default to AAUI on ANS anyway, and if you use it as
	  a module, you can provide the port_aaui=0|1 to force the driver.

config BMAC
	tristate "BMAC (G3 ethernet) support"
	depends on PPC_PMAC && PPC32
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  Say Y for support of BMAC Ethernet interfaces. These are used on G3
	  computers.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called bmac.

config MAC89x0
	tristate "Macintosh CS89x0 based ethernet cards"
	depends on MAC
	---help---
	  Support for CS89x0 chipset based Ethernet cards.  If you have a
	  Nubus or LC-PDS network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y and
	  read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. This module will
	  be called mac89x0.

config MACMACE
	bool "Macintosh (AV) onboard MACE ethernet"
	depends on MAC
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  Support for the onboard AMD 79C940 MACE Ethernet controller used in
	  the 660AV and 840AV Macintosh.  If you have one of these Macintoshes
	  say Y and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

config CS89x0
	tristate "CS89x0 support"
	depends on (ISA || EISA || MACH_IXDP2351 \
		|| ARCH_IXDP2X01 || MACH_MX31ADS || MACH_QQ2440)
	---help---
	  Support for CS89x0 chipset based Ethernet cards. If you have a
	  network (Ethernet) card of this type, say Y and read the
	  Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto> as well as
	  <file:Documentation/networking/cs89x0.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called cs89x0.

config CS89x0_NONISA_IRQ
	def_bool y
	depends on CS89x0 != n
	depends on MACH_IXDP2351 || ARCH_IXDP2X01 || MACH_MX31ADS || MACH_QQ2440
