	bool "Atheros devices"

	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Atheros devices. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

config ATL2
	tristate "Atheros L2 Fast Ethernet support"
	depends on PCI
	select CRC32
	select MII
	---help---
	  This driver supports the Atheros L2 fast ethernet adapter.
