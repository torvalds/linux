	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Nuvoton cards. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

	select MII
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to use built-in Ethernet ports
	  on w90p910 processor.
