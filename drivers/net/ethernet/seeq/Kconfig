	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about SEEQ devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	tristate "Acorn/ANT Ether3 support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_ACORN
	---help---
	  If you have an Acorn system with one of these network cards, you
	  should say Y to this option if you wish to use it with Linux.

config SGISEEQ
	tristate "SGI Seeq ethernet controller support"
	depends on SGI_HAS_SEEQ
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have an Seeq based Ethernet network card. This is
	  used in many Silicon Graphics machines.
