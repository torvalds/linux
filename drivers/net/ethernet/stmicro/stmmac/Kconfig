	  This selects the platform specific bus support for the stmmac driver.
	  This is the driver used on several SoCs:
	  STi, Allwinner, Amlogic Meson, Altera SOCFPGA.

	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

	---help---
	  This is to select the Synopsys DWMAC available on PCI devices,
	  if you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  This PCI support is tested on XLINX XC2V3000 FF1152AMT0221
	  D1215994A VIRTEX FPGA board.

	  If unsure, say N.
