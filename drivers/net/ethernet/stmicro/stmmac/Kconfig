config STMMAC_PLATFORM
	bool "STMMAC Platform bus support"
	depends on STMMAC_ETH
	default y
	---help---
	  This selects the platform specific bus support for the stmmac driver.
	  This is the driver used on several SoCs:
	  STi, Allwinner, Amlogic Meson, Altera SOCFPGA.

	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config STMMAC_PCI
	bool "STMMAC PCI bus support"
	depends on STMMAC_ETH && PCI
	---help---
	  This is to select the Synopsys DWMAC available on PCI devices,
	  if you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  This PCI support is tested on XLINX XC2V3000 FF1152AMT0221
	  D1215994A VIRTEX FPGA board.

	  If unsure, say N.

config STMMAC_DEBUG_FS
	bool "Enable monitoring via sysFS "

	depends on STMMAC_ETH && DEBUG_FS
	---help---
	  The stmmac entry in /sys reports DMA TX/RX rings
	  or (if supported) the HW cap register.

config STMMAC_DA
	bool "STMMAC DMA arbitration scheme"
	default n
	---help---
	  Selecting this option, rx has priority over Tx (only for Giga
	  Ethernet device).
	  By default, the DMA arbitration scheme is based on Round-robin
	  (rx:tx priority is 1:1).
