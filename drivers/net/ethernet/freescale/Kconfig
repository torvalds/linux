	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Freescale devices. If you say Y, you will be
	  asked for your specific card in the following questions.

	  Say Y here if you want to use the built-in 10/100 Fast ethernet
	  controller on some Motorola ColdFire and Freescale i.MX processors.

	depends on PPC_MPC52xx && PPC_BESTCOMM
	select CRC32
	select PHYLIB
	select PPC_BESTCOMM_FEC
	---help---
	  This option enables support for the MPC5200's on-chip
	  Fast Ethernet Controller
	  If compiled as module, it will be called fec_mpc52xx.

config FEC_MPC52xx_MDIO
	bool "FEC MPC52xx MDIO bus driver"
	depends on FEC_MPC52xx
	default y
	---help---
	  The MPC5200's FEC can connect to the Ethernet either with
	  an external MII PHY chip or 10 Mbps 7-wire interface
	  (Motorola? industry standard).
	  If your board uses an external PHY connected to FEC, enable this.
	  If not sure, enable.
	  If compiled as module, it will be called fec_mpc52xx_phy.

config FSL_PQ_MDIO
	tristate "Freescale PQ MDIO"
	select PHYLIB

	  This driver supports the MDIO bus used by the gianfar and UCC drivers.

config FSL_XGMAC_MDIO
	tristate "Freescale XGMAC MDIO"
	select PHYLIB
	depends on OF
	select OF_MDIO

config UCC_GETH
	tristate "Freescale QE Gigabit Ethernet"
	depends on QUICC_ENGINE
	select FSL_PQ_MDIO

	---help---
	  This driver supports the Gigabit Ethernet mode of the QUICC Engine,
	  which is available on some Freescale SOCs.

	  This driver supports the Gigabit TSEC on the MPC83xx, MPC85xx,
	  and MPC86xx family of chips, the eTSEC on LS1021A and the FEC
	  on the 8540.
