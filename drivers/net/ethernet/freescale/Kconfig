	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Freescale devices. If you say Y, you will be
	  asked for your specific card in the following questions.

	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to use the built-in 10/100 Fast ethernet
	  controller on some Motorola ColdFire and Freescale i.MX processors.

	tristate "FEC MPC52xx driver"
	depends on PPC_MPC52xx && PPC_BESTCOMM

	select PHYLIB
	select PPC_BESTCOMM_FEC
	---help---
	  This option enables support for the MPC5200's on-chip
	  Fast Ethernet Controller
	  If compiled as module, it will be called fec_mpc52xx.

config FEC_MPC52xx_MDIO
	bool "FEC MPC52xx MDIO bus driver"
	depends on FEC_MPC52xx
	default y
	---help---
	  The MPC5200's FEC can connect to the Ethernet either with
	  an external MII PHY chip or 10 Mbps 7-wire interface
	  (Motorola? industry standard).
	  If your board uses an external PHY connected to FEC, enable this.
	  If not sure, enable.
	  If compiled as module, it will be called fec_mpc52xx_phy.

config FSL_PQ_MDIO
	tristate "Freescale PQ MDIO"
	depends on FSL_SOC
	select PHYLIB
	---help---
	  This driver supports the MDIO bus used by the gianfar and UCC drivers.

config UCC_GETH
	tristate "Freescale QE Gigabit Ethernet"
	depends on QUICC_ENGINE
	select FSL_PQ_MDIO
	select PHYLIB
	---help---
	  This driver supports the Gigabit Ethernet mode of the QUICC Engine,
	  which is available on some Freescale SOCs.

config GIANFAR
	tristate "Gianfar Ethernet"
	depends on FSL_SOC

	select CRC32
	---help---
	  This driver supports the Gigabit TSEC on the MPC83xx, MPC85xx,
	  and MPC86xx family of chips, and the FEC on the 8540.
