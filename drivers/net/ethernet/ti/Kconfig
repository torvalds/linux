config NET_VENDOR_TI
	bool "Texas Instruments (TI) devices"
	default y
	depends on PCI || EISA || AR7 || (ARM && (ARCH_DAVINCI || ARCH_OMAP3))
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about TI devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	depends on ARM && ( ARCH_DAVINCI || ARCH_OMAP3 )
	select PHYLIB
	---help---
	  This driver supports TI's DaVinci MDIO module.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called davinci_mdio.  This is recommended.

config TI_DAVINCI_CPDMA
	tristate "TI DaVinci CPDMA Support"
	depends on ARM && ( ARCH_DAVINCI || ARCH_OMAP3 )
	---help---
	  This driver supports TI's DaVinci CPDMA dma engine.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called davinci_cpdma.  This is recommended.

	---help---
	  This driver supports TI's CPSW Ethernet Switch.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called cpsw.

config TLAN
	tristate "TI ThunderLAN support"
	depends on (PCI || EISA)
	---help---
	  If you have a PCI Ethernet network card based on the ThunderLAN chip
	  which is supported by this driver, say Y and read the
	  Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Devices currently supported by this driver are Compaq Netelligent,
	  Compaq NetFlex and Olicom cards.  Please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/networking/tlan.txt> for more details.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called tlan.

	  Please email feedback to <torben.mathiasen@compaq.com>.
