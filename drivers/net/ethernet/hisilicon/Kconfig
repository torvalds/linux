# HISILICON device configuration
#

config NET_VENDOR_HISILICON
	bool "Hisilicon devices"
	default y
	depends on (ARM && ARCH_HIP04)
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about MOXA ART devices. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_HISILICON

config HIP04_ETH
	tristate "HISILICON P04 Ethernet support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_HIP04
	select NET_CORE
	---help---
	  If you wish to compile a kernel for a hardware with hisilicon p04 SoC and
	  want to use the internal ethernet then you should answer Y to this.
