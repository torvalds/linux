	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card from Mucse(R), say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Mucse(R) cards. If you say Y, you will
	  be asked for your specific card in the following questions.
