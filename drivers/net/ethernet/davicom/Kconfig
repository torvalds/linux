config DM9000
	tristate "DM9000 support"
	depends on ARM || MIPS || COLDFIRE || NIOS2
	select CRC32
	select MII
	---help---
	  Support for DM9000 chipset.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.  The module
	  will be called dm9000.

config DM9000_FORCE_SIMPLE_PHY_POLL
	bool "Force simple NSR based PHY polling"
	depends on DM9000
	---help---
	  This configuration forces the DM9000 to use the NSR's LinkStatus
	  bit to determine if the link is up or down instead of the more
	  costly MII PHY reads. Note, this will not work if the chip is
	  operating with an external PHY.
