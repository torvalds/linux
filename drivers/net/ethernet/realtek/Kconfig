config NET_VENDOR_REALTEK
	bool "Realtek devices"
	default y
	depends on PCI || (PARPORT && X86)
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Realtek devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_REALTEK

config ATP
	tristate "AT-LAN-TEC/RealTek pocket adapter support"
	depends on PARPORT && X86
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  This is a network (Ethernet) device which attaches to your parallel
	  port. Read <file:drivers/net/atp.c> as well as the Ethernet-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, if you
	  want to use this.  If you intend to use this driver, you should have
	  said N to the "Parallel printer support", because the two drivers
	  don't like each other.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called atp.

config 8139CP
	tristate "RealTek RTL-8139 C+ PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	select CRC32
	select NET_CORE
	select MII
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the Fast Ethernet PCI network cards based on
	  the RTL8139C+ chips. If you have one of those, say Y and read
	  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called 8139cp.  This is recommended.

config 8139TOO
	tristate "RealTek RTL-8129/8130/8139 PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter support"
	depends on PCI
	select CRC32
	select NET_CORE
	select MII
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the Fast Ethernet PCI network cards based on
	  the RTL 8129/8130/8139 chips. If you have one of those, say Y and
	  read the Ethernet-HOWTO <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called 8139too.  This is recommended.

config 8139TOO_PIO
	bool "Use PIO instead of MMIO"
	default y
	depends on 8139TOO
	---help---
	  This instructs the driver to use programmed I/O ports (PIO) instead
	  of PCI shared memory (MMIO).  This can possibly solve some problems
	  in case your mainboard has memory consistency issues.  If unsure,
	  say N.

config 8139TOO_TUNE_TWISTER
	bool "Support for uncommon RTL-8139 rev. K (automatic channel equalization)"
	depends on 8139TOO
	---help---
	  This implements a function which might come in handy in case you
	  are using low quality on long cabling. It is required for RealTek
	  RTL-8139 revision K boards, and totally unused otherwise.  It tries
	  to match the transceiver to the cable characteristics. This is
	  experimental since hardly documented by the manufacturer.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config 8139TOO_8129
	bool "Support for older RTL-8129/8130 boards"
	depends on 8139TOO
	---help---
	  This enables support for the older and uncommon RTL-8129 and
	  RTL-8130 chips, which support MII via an external transceiver,
	  instead of an internal one.  Disabling this option will save some
	  memory by making the code size smaller.  If unsure, say Y.

config 8139_OLD_RX_RESET
	bool "Use older RX-reset method"
	depends on 8139TOO
	---help---
	  The 8139too driver was recently updated to contain a more rapid
	  reset sequence, in the face of severe receive errors.  This "new"
	  RX-reset method should be adequate for all boards.  But if you
	  experience problems, you can enable this option to restore the
	  old RX-reset behavior.  If unsure, say N.

config R8169
	tristate "Realtek 8169 gigabit ethernet support"
	depends on PCI
	select FW_LOADER
	select CRC32
	select NET_CORE
	select MII
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have a Realtek 8169 PCI Gigabit Ethernet adapter.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called r8169.  This is recommended.
