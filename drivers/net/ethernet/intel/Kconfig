config NET_VENDOR_INTEL
	bool "Intel devices"
	default y
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Intel cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

config E100
	tristate "Intel(R) PRO/100+ support"
	depends on PCI
	select MII
	---help---
	  This driver supports Intel(R) PRO/100 family of adapters.
	  To verify that your adapter is supported, find the board ID number
	  on the adapter. Look for a label that has a barcode and a number
	  in the format 123456-001 (six digits hyphen three digits).

	  Use the above information and the Adapter & Driver ID Guide at:

	  <http://support.intel.com/support/network/adapter/pro100/21397.htm>

	  to identify the adapter.

	  For the latest Intel PRO/100 network driver for Linux, see:

	  <http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/highlights/network/pro100plus>

	  More specific information on configuring the driver is in
