	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  the questions about Fujitsu cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_FUJITSU

config PCMCIA_FMVJ18X
	tristate "Fujitsu FMV-J18x PCMCIA support"
	depends on PCMCIA
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you intend to attach a Fujitsu FMV-J18x or compatible
	  PCMCIA (PC-card) Ethernet card to your computer.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called fmvj18x_cs.  If unsure, say N.
