config NET_VENDOR_NATSEMI
	bool "National Semi-conductor devices"
	default y
	depends on AMIGA_PCMCIA || ARM || EISA || EXPERIMENTAL || H8300 || \
		   ISA || M32R || MAC || MACH_JAZZ || MACH_TX49XX || MCA || \
		   MCA_LEGACY || MIPS || PCI || PCMCIA || SUPERH || \
		   XTENSA_PLATFORM_XT2000 || ZORRO
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about National Semi-conductor devices. If you say Y,
	  you will be asked for your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_NATSEMI

config IBMLANA
	tristate "IBM LAN Adapter/A support"
	depends on MCA
	---help---
	  This is a Micro Channel Ethernet adapter.  You need to set
	  CONFIG_MCA to use this driver.  It is both available as an in-kernel
	  driver and as a module.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The only
	  currently supported card is the IBM LAN Adapter/A for Ethernet.  It
	  will both support 16K and 32K memory windows, however a 32K window
	  gives a better security against packet losses.  Usage of multiple
	  boards with this driver should be possible, but has not been tested
	  up to now due to lack of hardware.

config MACSONIC
	tristate "Macintosh SONIC based ethernet (onboard, NuBus, LC, CS)"
	depends on MAC
	---help---
	  Support for NatSemi SONIC based Ethernet devices.  This includes
	  the onboard Ethernet in many Quadras as well as some LC-PDS,
	  a few Nubus and all known Comm Slot Ethernet cards.  If you have
	  one of these say Y and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. This module will
	  be called macsonic.

config MIPS_JAZZ_SONIC
	tristate "MIPS JAZZ onboard SONIC Ethernet support"
	depends on MACH_JAZZ
	---help---
	  This is the driver for the onboard card of MIPS Magnum 4000,
	  Acer PICA, Olivetti M700-10 and a few other identical OEM systems.

config NATSEMI
	tristate "National Semiconductor DP8381x series PCI Ethernet support"
	depends on PCI
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  This driver is for the National Semiconductor DP83810 series,
	  which is used in cards from PureData, NetGear, Linksys
	  and others, including the 83815 chip.
	  More specific information and updates are available from
	  <http://www.scyld.com/network/natsemi.html>.

config NS83820
	tristate "National Semiconductor DP83820 support"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the National Semiconductor DP83820 series
	  of gigabit ethernet MACs.  Cards using this chipset include
	  the D-Link DGE-500T, PureData's PDP8023Z-TG, SMC's SMC9462TX,
	  SOHO-GA2000T, SOHO-GA2500T.  The driver supports the use of
	  zero copy.

config XTENSA_XT2000_SONIC
	tristate "Xtensa XT2000 onboard SONIC Ethernet support"
	depends on XTENSA_PLATFORM_XT2000
	---help---
	  This is the driver for the onboard card of the Xtensa XT2000 board.
