	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Cirrus cards. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

	  Say Y to compile the cs89x0 platform driver. This makes this driver
	  suitable for use on certain evaluation boards such as the iMX21ADS.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called cs89x0.
