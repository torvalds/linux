	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) chipset belonging to this class,
	  say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question does not directly affect
	  the kernel: saying N will just case the configurator to skip all
	  the questions regarding AMD chipsets. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific chipset/driver in the following questions.

	  Most Sun3 and Sun3x motherboards (including the 3/50, 3/60 and 3/80)
	  featured an AMD LANCE 10Mbit Ethernet controller on board; say Y
	  here to compile in the Linux driver for this and enable Ethernet.
	  General Linux information on the Sun 3 and 3x series (now
	  discontinued) is at
	  <http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/tech68k/sun3.html>.

	  If you're not building a kernel for a Sun 3, say N.
