	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about RDC cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

	---help---
	  This is a driver for the R6040 Fast Ethernet MACs found in the
	  the RDC R-321x System-on-chips.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called r6040. This is recommended.
