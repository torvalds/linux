	  Say Y if you would like to include support for any PCMCIA or CardBus
	  network adapters, then say Y to the driver for your particular card
	  below.  PCMCIA- or PC-cards are credit-card size devices often used
	  with laptops computers; CardBus is the newer and faster version of
	  PCMCIA.

	  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
	  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
	  for location).  You also want to check out the PCMCIA-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If unsure, say N.

if NET_PCMCIA && PCMCIA

config ARCNET_COM20020_CS

	depends on ARCNET_COM20020
	help
	  Say Y here if you intend to attach this type of ARCnet PCMCIA card
	  to your computer.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called com20020_cs.  If unsure, say N.
