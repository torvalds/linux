menuconfig WAN
	bool "Wan interfaces support"
	help
	  Wide Area Networks (WANs), such as X.25, Frame Relay and leased
	  lines, are used to interconnect Local Area Networks (LANs) over vast
	  distances with data transfer rates significantly higher than those
	  achievable with commonly used asynchronous modem connections.

	  Usually, a quite expensive external device called a `WAN router' is
	  needed to connect to a WAN. As an alternative, a relatively
	  inexpensive WAN interface card can allow your Linux box to directly
	  connect to a WAN.

	  If you have one of those cards and wish to use it under Linux,
	  say Y here and also to the WAN driver for your card.

	  If unsure, say N.
