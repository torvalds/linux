menuconfig WAN
	bool "Wan interfaces support"
	---help---
	  Wide Area Networks (WANs), such as X.25, Frame Relay and leased
	  lines, are used to interconnect Local Area Networks (LANs) over vast
	  distances with data transfer rates significantly higher than those
	  achievable with commonly used asynchronous modem connections.

	  Usually, a quite expensive external device called a `WAN router' is
	  needed to connect to a WAN. As an alternative, a relatively
	  inexpensive WAN interface card can allow your Linux box to directly
	  connect to a WAN.

	  If you have one of those cards and wish to use it under Linux,
	  say Y here and also to the WAN driver for your card.

	  If unsure, say N.

	---help---
	  Driver for COSA and SRP synchronous serial boards.

	  These boards allow to connect synchronous serial devices (for example
	  base-band modems, or any other device with the X.21, V.24, V.35 or
	  V.36 interface) to your Linux box. The cards can work as the
	  character device, synchronous PPP network device, or the Cisco HDLC
	  network device.

	  You will need user-space utilities COSA or SRP boards for downloading
 	  the firmware to the cards and to set them up. Look at the
	  <http://www.fi.muni.cz/~kas/cosa/> for more information. You can also
	  read the comment at the top of the <file:drivers/net/wan/cosa.c> for
	  details about the cards and the driver itself.

config DSCC4

config DSCC4_PCI_RST

	  Various DSCC4 bugs forbid any reliable software reset of the ASIC.
	  As a replacement, some vendors provide a way to assert the PCI #RST
	  pin of DSCC4 through the GPIO port of the card. If you choose Y,
	  the driver will make use of this feature before module removal
	  (i.e. rmmod). The feature is known to be available on Commtech's
	  cards. Contact your manufacturer for details.

	  Say Y if your card supports this feature.

config DLCI
	tristate "Frame Relay DLCI support"
	---help---
	  Support for the Frame Relay protocol.

	  Frame Relay is a fast low-cost way to connect to a remote Internet
	  access provider or to form a private wide area network. The one
	  physical line from your box to the local "switch" (i.e. the entry
	  point to the Frame Relay network, usually at the phone company) can
	  carry several logical point-to-point connections to other computers
	  connected to the Frame Relay network. For a general explanation of
	  the protocol, check out <http://www.mplsforum.org/>.

	  To use frame relay, you need supporting hardware (called FRAD) and
	  certain programs from the net-tools package as explained in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/framerelay.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called dlci.

config DLCI_MAX

	  of your hardware frame relay access devices.

	  Go with the default.

	  Driver for the Sangoma S502A, S502E, and S508 Frame Relay Access
	  Devices.

	  These are multi-protocol cards, but only Frame Relay is supported
	  by the driver at this time. Please read
