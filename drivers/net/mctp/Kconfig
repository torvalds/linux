config MCTP_SERIAL
	tristate "MCTP serial transport"
	depends on TTY
	select CRC_CCITT
	help
	  This driver provides an MCTP-over-serial interface, through a
	  serial line-discipline, as defined by DMTF specification "DSP0253 -
	  MCTP Serial Transport Binding". By attaching the ldisc to a serial
	  device, we get a new net device to transport MCTP packets.

	  This allows communication with external MCTP endpoints which use
	  serial as their transport. It can also be used as an easy way to
	  provide MCTP connectivity between virtual machines, by forwarding
	  data between simple virtual serial devices.

	  Say y here if you need to connect to MCTP endpoints over serial. To
	  compile as a module, use m; the module will be called mctp-serial.

config MCTP_SERIAL_TEST
        bool "MCTP serial tests" if !KUNIT_ALL_TESTS
        depends on MCTP_SERIAL=y && KUNIT=y
        default KUNIT_ALL_TESTS

config MCTP_TRANSPORT_I2C
	tristate "MCTP SMBus/I2C transport"
	# i2c-mux is optional, but we must build as a module if i2c-mux is a module
	depends on I2C_MUX || !I2C_MUX
	depends on I2C
	depends on I2C_SLAVE
	select MCTP_FLOWS
	help
	  Provides a driver to access MCTP devices over SMBus/I2C transport,
	  from DMTF specification DSP0237. A MCTP protocol network device is
	  created for each I2C bus that has been assigned a mctp-i2c device.

config MCTP_TRANSPORT_I3C
	tristate "MCTP I3C transport"
	depends on I3C
	help
	  Provides a driver to access MCTP devices over I3C transport,
	  from DMTF specification DSP0233.
	  A MCTP protocol network device is created for each I3C bus
	  having a "mctp-controller" devicetree property.

config MCTP_TRANSPORT_USB
	tristate "MCTP USB transport"
	depends on USB
	help
	  Provides a driver to access MCTP devices over USB transport,
	  defined by DMTF specification DSP0283.

	  MCTP-over-USB interfaces are peer-to-peer, so each interface
	  represents a physical connection to one remote MCTP endpoint.
