config USB_CATC
	tristate "USB CATC NetMate-based Ethernet device support"
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  Say Y if you want to use one of the following 10Mbps USB Ethernet
	  device based on the EL1210A chip. Supported devices are:
	  Belkin F5U011
	  Belkin F5U111
	  CATC NetMate
	  CATC NetMate II
	  smartBridges smartNIC

	  This driver makes the adapter appear as a normal Ethernet interface,
	  typically on eth0, if it is the only ethernet device, or perhaps on
	  eth1, if you have a PCI or ISA ethernet card installed.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called catc.

config USB_KAWETH

	  3Com 3C19250
	  ADS USB-10BT
	  ATEN USB Ethernet
	  ASANTE USB To Ethernet Adapter
	  AOX Endpoints USB Ethernet
	  Correga K.K.

	  NetGear EA-101
	  Peracom Enet and Enet2
	  Portsmith Express Ethernet Adapter
	  Shark Pocket Adapter
	  SMC 2202USB
	  Sony Vaio port extender

	  This driver is likely to work with most 10Mbps only USB Ethernet
	  adapters, including some "no brand" devices. It does NOT work on
	  SmartBridges smartNIC or on Belkin F5U111 devices - you should use
	  the CATC NetMate driver for those. If you are not sure which one
	  you need, select both, and the correct one should be selected for
	  you.

	  This driver makes the adapter appear as a normal Ethernet interface,
	  typically on eth0, if it is the only ethernet device, or perhaps on
	  eth1, if you have a PCI or ISA ethernet card installed.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	  If your particular adapter is not in the list and you are _sure_ it

config USB_USBNET
	tristate "Multi-purpose USB Networking Framework"
	select MII
	---help---
	  This driver supports several kinds of network links over USB,
	  with "minidrivers" built around a common network driver core
	  that supports deep queues for efficient transfers.  (This gives
	  better performance with small packets and at high speeds).

	  The USB host runs "usbnet", and the other end of the link might be:

	  - Another USB host, when using USB "network" or "data transfer"
	    cables.  These are often used to network laptops to PCs, like
	    "Laplink" parallel cables or some motherboards.  These rely
	    on specialized chips from many suppliers.

	  - An intelligent USB gadget, perhaps embedding a Linux system.
	    These include PDAs running Linux (iPaq, Yopy, Zaurus, and
	    others), and devices that interoperate using the standard
	    CDC-Ethernet specification (including many cable modems).

	  - Network adapter hardware (like those for 10/100 Ethernet) which
	    uses this driver framework.

	  The link will appear with a name like "usb0", when the link is
	  a two-node link, or "eth0" for most CDC-Ethernet devices.  Those
	  two-node links are most easily managed with Ethernet Bridging
	  (CONFIG_BRIDGE) instead of routing.

	  For more information see <http://www.linux-usb.org/usbnet/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called usbnet.

	  CDC Ethernet is an implementation option for DOCSIS cable modems
	  that support USB connectivity, used for non-Microsoft USB hosts.
	  The Linux-USB CDC Ethernet Gadget driver is an open implementation.
 	  This driver should work with at least the following devices:

 	    * Broadcom Cable Modem (reference design)
	    * Toshiba (PCX1100U and F3507g/F3607gw)
	    * ...

	  This driver creates an interface named "ethX", where X depends on
	  what other networking devices you have in use.  However, if the
	  IEEE 802 "local assignment" bit is set in the address, a "usbX"
	  name is used instead.

config USB_NET_CDC_EEM

	  available from <http://www.usb.org/>.

	  MBIM devices require configuration using the management
	  protocol defined by the MBIM specification.  This driver

	  be at the root of Microsoft's "ActiveSync" too.

	  Avoid using this protocol unless you have no better options.
	  The protocol specification is incomplete, and is controlled by

	  This driver module supports USB network devices that can work
	  without any device-specific information.  Select it if you have
	  one of these drivers.

	  Note that while many USB host-to-host cables can work in this mode,
	  that may mean not being able to talk to Win32 systems or more
	  commonly not being able to handle certain events (like replugging
	  the host on the other end) very well.  Also, these devices will
	  not generally have permanently assigned Ethernet addresses.

	  Choose this option to support the "usb-eth" networking driver
	  used by most of the ARM Linux community with device controllers
	  such as the SA-11x0 and PXA-25x UDCs, or the tftp capabilities
	  in some PXA versions of the "blob" boot loader.

	  Linux-based "Gumstix" PXA-25x based systems use this protocol
	  to talk with other Linux systems.

	  Although the ROMs shipped with Sharp Zaurus products use a
	  different link level framing protocol, you can have them use
	  this simpler protocol by installing a different kernel.

config USB_EPSON2888

	  This also supports some related device firmware, as used in some
	  PDAs from Olympus and some cell phones from Motorola.

	  If you install an alternate image, such as the Linux 2.6 based
	  versions of OpenZaurus, you should no longer need to support this
	  protocol.  Only the "eth-fd" or "net_fd" drivers in these devices
	  really need this non-conformant variant of CDC Ethernet (or in
	  some cases CDC MDLM) protocol, not "g_ether".
