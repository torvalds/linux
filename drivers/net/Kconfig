menuconfig NETDEVICES
	default y if UML
	depends on NET
	bool "Network device support"
	---help---
	  You can say N here if you don't intend to connect your Linux box to
	  any other computer at all.

	  You'll have to say Y if your computer contains a network card that
	  you want to use under Linux. If you are going to run SLIP or PPP over
	  telephone line or null modem cable you need say Y here. Connecting
	  two machines with parallel ports using PLIP needs this, as well as
	  AX.25/KISS for sending Internet traffic over amateur radio links.

	  See also "The Linux Network Administrator's Guide" by Olaf Kirch and
	  Terry Dawson. Available at <http://www.tldp.org/guides.html>.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config IFB
	tristate "Intermediate Functional Block support"
	depends on NET_CLS_ACT
	---help---
	  This is an intermediate driver that allows sharing of
	  resources.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ifb.  If you want to use more than one ifb
	  device at a time, you need to compile this driver as a module.
	  Instead of 'ifb', the devices will then be called 'ifb0',
	  'ifb1' etc.
	  Look at the iproute2 documentation directory for usage etc

config DUMMY
	tristate "Dummy net driver support"
	---help---
	  This is essentially a bit-bucket device (i.e. traffic you send to
	  this device is consigned into oblivion) with a configurable IP
	  address. It is most commonly used in order to make your currently
	  inactive SLIP address seem like a real address for local programs.
	  If you use SLIP or PPP, you might want to say Y here. Since this
	  thing often comes in handy, the default is Y. It won't enlarge your
	  kernel either. What a deal. Read about it in the Network
	  Administrator's Guide, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#guide>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called dummy.  If you want to use more than one dummy
	  device at a time, you need to compile this driver as a module.
	  Instead of 'dummy', the devices will then be called 'dummy0',
	  'dummy1' etc.

config BONDING
	tristate "Bonding driver support"
	depends on INET
	---help---
	  Say 'Y' or 'M' if you wish to be able to 'bond' multiple Ethernet
	  Channels together. This is called 'Etherchannel' by Cisco,
	  'Trunking' by Sun, 802.3ad by the IEEE, and 'Bonding' in Linux.

	  The driver supports multiple bonding modes to allow for both high
	  performance and high availability operation.

	  Refer to <file:Documentation/networking/bonding.txt> for more
	  information.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called bonding.

config MACVLAN
	tristate "MAC-VLAN support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This allows one to create virtual interfaces that map packets to
	  or from specific MAC addresses to a particular interface.

	  Macvlan devices can be added using the "ip" command from the
	  iproute2 package starting with the iproute2-2.6.23 release:

	  "ip link add link <real dev> [ address MAC ] [ NAME ] type macvlan"

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called macvlan.

config EQUALIZER
	tristate "EQL (serial line load balancing) support"
	---help---
	  If you have two serial connections to some other computer (this
	  usually requires two modems and two telephone lines) and you use
	  SLIP (the protocol for sending Internet traffic over telephone
	  lines) or PPP (a better SLIP) on them, you can make them behave like
	  one double speed connection using this driver.  Naturally, this has
	  to be supported at the other end as well, either with a similar EQL
	  Linux driver or with a Livingston Portmaster 2e.

	  Say Y if you want this and read
	  <file:Documentation/networking/eql.txt>.  You may also want to read
	  section 6.2 of the NET-3-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called eql.  If unsure, say N.

config TUN
	tristate "Universal TUN/TAP device driver support"
	select CRC32
	---help---
	  TUN/TAP provides packet reception and transmission for user space
	  programs.  It can be viewed as a simple Point-to-Point or Ethernet
	  device, which instead of receiving packets from a physical media,
	  receives them from user space program and instead of sending packets
	  via physical media writes them to the user space program.

	  When a program opens /dev/net/tun, driver creates and registers
	  corresponding net device tunX or tapX.  After a program closed above
	  devices, driver will automatically delete tunXX or tapXX device and
	  all routes corresponding to it.

	  Please read <file:Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt> for more
	  information.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called tun.

	  If you don't know what to use this for, you don't need it.

config VETH
	tristate "Virtual ethernet pair device"
	---help---
	  This device is a local ethernet tunnel. Devices are created in pairs.
	  When one end receives the packet it appears on its pair and vice
	  versa.

config NET_SB1000
	tristate "General Instruments Surfboard 1000"
	depends on PNP
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the General Instrument (also known as
	  NextLevel) SURFboard 1000 internal
	  cable modem. This is an ISA card which is used by a number of cable
	  TV companies to provide cable modem access. It's a one-way
	  downstream-only cable modem, meaning that your upstream net link is
	  provided by your regular phone modem.

	  At present this driver only compiles as a module, so say M here if
	  you have this card. The module will be called sb1000. Then read
	  <file:Documentation/networking/README.sb1000> for information on how
	  to use this module, as it needs special ppp scripts for establishing
	  a connection. Further documentation and the necessary scripts can be
	  found at:

	  <http://www.jacksonville.net/~fventuri/>
	  <http://home.adelphia.net/~siglercm/sb1000.html>

	  If you don't have this card, of course say N.

	bool "Ethernet (10 or 100Mbit)"
	depends on !UML
	---help---
	  Ethernet (also called IEEE 802.3 or ISO 8802-2) is the most common
	  type of Local Area Network (LAN) in universities and companies.

	  Common varieties of Ethernet are: 10BASE-2 or Thinnet (10 Mbps over
	  coaxial cable, linking computers in a chain), 10BASE-T or twisted
	  pair (10 Mbps over twisted pair cable, linking computers to central
	  hubs), 10BASE-F (10 Mbps over optical fiber links, using hubs),
	  100BASE-TX (100 Mbps over two twisted pair cables, using hubs),
	  100BASE-T4 (100 Mbps over 4 standard voice-grade twisted pair
	  cables, using hubs), 100BASE-FX (100 Mbps over optical fiber links)
	  [the 100BASE varieties are also known as Fast Ethernet], and Gigabit
	  Ethernet (1 Gbps over optical fiber or short copper links).

	  If your Linux machine will be connected to an Ethernet and you have
	  an Ethernet network interface card (NIC) installed in your computer,
	  say Y here and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. You will then also have
	  to say Y to the driver for your particular NIC.

	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Ethernet network cards. If unsure, say N.

config ROADRUNNER_LARGE_RINGS
	bool "Use large TX/RX rings (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on ROADRUNNER
	help
	  If you say Y here, the RoadRunner driver will preallocate up to 2 MB
	  of additional memory to allow for fastest operation, both for
	  transmitting and receiving. This memory cannot be used by any other
	  kernel code or by user space programs. Say Y here only if you have
	  the memory.

config PLIP
	tristate "PLIP (parallel port) support"
	depends on PARPORT
	---help---
	  PLIP (Parallel Line Internet Protocol) is used to create a
	  reasonably fast mini network consisting of two (or, rarely, more)
	  local machines.  A PLIP link from a Linux box is a popular means to
	  install a Linux distribution on a machine which doesn't have a
	  CD-ROM drive (a minimal system has to be transferred with floppies
	  first). The kernels on both machines need to have this PLIP option
	  enabled for this to work.

	  The PLIP driver has two modes, mode 0 and mode 1.  The parallel
	  ports (the connectors at the computers with 25 holes) are connected
	  with "null printer" or "Turbo Laplink" cables which can transmit 4
	  bits at a time (mode 0) or with special PLIP cables, to be used on
	  bidirectional parallel ports only, which can transmit 8 bits at a
	  time (mode 1); you can find the wiring of these cables in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/PLIP.txt>.  The cables can be up to
	  15m long.  Mode 0 works also if one of the machines runs DOS/Windows
	  and has some PLIP software installed, e.g. the Crynwr PLIP packet
	  driver (<http://oak.oakland.edu/simtel.net/msdos/pktdrvr-pre.html>)
	  and winsock or NCSA's telnet.

	  If you want to use PLIP, say Y and read the PLIP mini-HOWTO as well
	  as the NET-3-HOWTO, both available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Note that the PLIP
	  protocol has been changed and this PLIP driver won't work together
	  with the PLIP support in Linux versions 1.0.x.  This option enlarges
	  your kernel by about 8 KB.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called plip. If unsure, say Y or M, in case you buy
	  a laptop later.

config PPP
	tristate "PPP (point-to-point protocol) support"
	select SLHC
	---help---
	  PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is a newer and better SLIP.  It serves
	  the same purpose: sending Internet traffic over telephone (and other
	  serial) lines.  Ask your access provider if they support it, because
	  otherwise you can't use it; most Internet access providers these
	  days support PPP rather than SLIP.

	  To use PPP, you need an additional program called pppd as described
	  in the PPP-HOWTO, available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Make sure that you have
	  the version of pppd recommended in <file:Documentation/Changes>.
	  The PPP option enlarges your kernel by about 16 KB.

	  There are actually two versions of PPP: the traditional PPP for
	  asynchronous lines, such as regular analog phone lines, and
	  synchronous PPP which can be used over digital ISDN lines for
	  example.  If you want to use PPP over phone lines or other
	  asynchronous serial lines, you need to say Y (or M) here and also to
	  the next option, "PPP support for async serial ports".  For PPP over
	  synchronous lines, you should say Y (or M) here and to "Support
	  synchronous PPP", below.

	  If you said Y to "Version information on all symbols" above, then
	  you cannot compile the PPP driver into the kernel; you can then only
	  compile it as a module. To compile this driver as a module, choose M
	  here. The module will be called ppp_generic.

config PPP_MULTILINK
	bool "PPP multilink support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PPP && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  PPP multilink is a protocol (defined in RFC 1990) which allows you
	  to combine several (logical or physical) lines into one logical PPP
	  connection, so that you can utilize your full bandwidth.

	  This has to be supported at the other end as well and you need a
	  version of the pppd daemon which understands the multilink protocol.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PPP_FILTER
	bool "PPP filtering"
	depends on PPP
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to be able to filter the packets passing over
	  PPP interfaces.  This allows you to control which packets count as
	  activity (i.e. which packets will reset the idle timer or bring up
	  a demand-dialed link) and which packets are to be dropped entirely.
	  You need to say Y here if you wish to use the pass-filter and
	  active-filter options to pppd.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PPP_ASYNC
	tristate "PPP support for async serial ports"
	depends on PPP
	select CRC_CCITT
	---help---
	  Say Y (or M) here if you want to be able to use PPP over standard
	  asynchronous serial ports, such as COM1 or COM2 on a PC.  If you use
	  a modem (not a synchronous or ISDN modem) to contact your ISP, you
	  need this option.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config PPP_SYNC_TTY
	tristate "PPP support for sync tty ports"
	depends on PPP
	help
	  Say Y (or M) here if you want to be able to use PPP over synchronous
	  (HDLC) tty devices, such as the SyncLink adapter. These devices
	  are often used for high-speed leased lines like T1/E1.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

config PPP_DEFLATE
	tristate "PPP Deflate compression"
	depends on PPP
	select ZLIB_INFLATE
	select ZLIB_DEFLATE
	---help---
	  Support for the Deflate compression method for PPP, which uses the
	  Deflate algorithm (the same algorithm that gzip uses) to compress
	  each PPP packet before it is sent over the wire.  The machine at the
	  other end of the PPP link (usually your ISP) has to support the
	  Deflate compression method as well for this to be useful.  Even if
	  they don't support it, it is safe to say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

config PPP_BSDCOMP
	tristate "PPP BSD-Compress compression"
	depends on PPP
	---help---
	  Support for the BSD-Compress compression method for PPP, which uses
	  the LZW compression method to compress each PPP packet before it is
	  sent over the wire. The machine at the other end of the PPP link
	  (usually your ISP) has to support the BSD-Compress compression
	  method as well for this to be useful. Even if they don't support it,
	  it is safe to say Y here.

	  The PPP Deflate compression method ("PPP Deflate compression",
	  above) is preferable to BSD-Compress, because it compresses better
	  and is patent-free.

	  Note that the BSD compression code will always be compiled as a
	  module; it is called bsd_comp and will show up in the directory
	  modules once you have said "make modules". If unsure, say N.

config PPP_MPPE

       ---help---
         Support for the MPPE Encryption protocol, as employed by the
	 Microsoft Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol.

	 See http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/ for information on
	 configuring PPTP clients and servers to utilize this method.

config PPPOE
	tristate "PPP over Ethernet (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PPP
	help
	  Support for PPP over Ethernet.

	  This driver requires the latest version of pppd from the CVS
	  repository at cvs.samba.org.  Alternatively, see the 
	  RoaringPenguin package (<http://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe>)
	  which contains instruction on how to use this driver (under 
	  the heading "Kernel mode PPPoE").

config PPPOATM
	tristate "PPP over ATM"
	depends on ATM && PPP
	help
	  Support PPP (Point to Point Protocol) encapsulated in ATM frames.
	  This implementation does not yet comply with section 8 of RFC2364,
	  which can lead to bad results if the ATM peer loses state and
	  changes its encapsulation unilaterally.

config PPPOL2TP
	tristate "PPP over L2TP (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PPP && INET
	help
	  Support for PPP-over-L2TP socket family. L2TP is a protocol
	  used by ISPs and enterprises to tunnel PPP traffic over UDP
	  tunnels. L2TP is replacing PPTP for VPN uses.

	  This kernel component handles only L2TP data packets: a
	  userland daemon handles L2TP the control protocol (tunnel
	  and session setup). One such daemon is OpenL2TP
	  (http://openl2tp.sourceforge.net/).

config SLIP
	tristate "SLIP (serial line) support"
	---help---
	  Say Y if you intend to use SLIP or CSLIP (compressed SLIP) to
	  connect to your Internet service provider or to connect to some
	  other local Unix box or if you want to configure your Linux box as a
	  Slip/CSlip server for other people to dial in. SLIP (Serial Line
	  Internet Protocol) is a protocol used to send Internet traffic over
	  serial connections such as telephone lines or null modem cables;
	  nowadays, the protocol PPP is more commonly used for this same
	  purpose.

	  Normally, your access provider has to support SLIP in order for you
	  to be able to use it, but there is now a SLIP emulator called SLiRP
	  around (available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which
	  allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection. If
	  you plan to use SLiRP, make sure to say Y to CSLIP, below. The
	  NET-3-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to
	  configure SLIP. Note that you don't need this option if you just
	  want to run term (term is a program which gives you almost full
	  Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up shell account on
	  some Internet connected Unix computer. Read
	  <http://www.bart.nl/~patrickr/term-howto/Term-HOWTO.html>). SLIP
	  support will enlarge your kernel by about 4 KB. If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called slip.

config SLIP_COMPRESSED
	bool "CSLIP compressed headers"
	depends on SLIP
	select SLHC
	---help---
	  This protocol is faster than SLIP because it uses compression on the
	  TCP/IP headers (not on the data itself), but it has to be supported
	  on both ends. Ask your access provider if you are not sure and
	  answer Y, just in case. You will still be able to use plain SLIP. If
	  you plan to use SLiRP, the SLIP emulator (available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which
	  allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection, you
	  definitely want to say Y here. The NET-3-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to configure
	  CSLIP. This won't enlarge your kernel.

config SLHC
	tristate
	help
	  This option enables Van Jacobsen serial line header compression
	  routines.

config SLIP_SMART
	bool "Keepalive and linefill"
	depends on SLIP
	help
	  Adds additional capabilities to the SLIP driver to support the
	  RELCOM line fill and keepalive monitoring. Ideal on poor quality
	  analogue lines.

config SLIP_MODE_SLIP6
	bool "Six bit SLIP encapsulation"
	depends on SLIP
	help
	  Just occasionally you may need to run IP over hostile serial
	  networks that don't pass all control characters or are only seven
	  bit. Saying Y here adds an extra mode you can use with SLIP:
	  "slip6". In this mode, SLIP will only send normal ASCII symbols over
	  the serial device. Naturally, this has to be supported at the other
	  end of the link as well. It's good enough, for example, to run IP
	  over the async ports of a Camtec JNT Pad. If unsure, say N.

config NET_FC
	bool "Fibre Channel driver support"
	depends on SCSI && PCI
	help
	  Fibre Channel is a high speed serial protocol mainly used to connect
	  large storage devices to the computer; it is compatible with and
	  intended to replace SCSI.

	  If you intend to use Fibre Channel, you need to have a Fibre channel
	  adaptor card in your computer; say Y here and to the driver for your
	  adaptor below. You also should have said Y to "SCSI support" and
	  "SCSI generic support".

config NETCONSOLE
	tristate "Network console logging support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
