config CAN_VCAN
	tristate "Virtual Local CAN Interface (vcan)"
	---help---
	  Similar to the network loopback devices, vcan offers a
	  virtual local CAN interface.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called vcan.

config CAN_SLCAN
	tristate "Serial / USB serial CAN Adaptors (slcan)"
	depends on TTY
	---help---
	  CAN driver for several 'low cost' CAN interfaces that are attached
	  via serial lines or via USB-to-serial adapters using the LAWICEL
	  ASCII protocol. The driver implements the tty linediscipline N_SLCAN.

	  As only the sending and receiving of CAN frames is implemented, this
	  driver should work with the (serial/USB) CAN hardware from:
	  www.canusb.com / www.can232.com / www.mictronics.de / www.canhack.de

	  Userspace tools to attach the SLCAN line discipline (slcan_attach,
	  slcand) can be found in the can-utils at the SocketCAN SVN, see
	  http://developer.berlios.de/projects/socketcan for details.

	  The slcan driver supports up to 10 CAN netdevices by default which
	  can be changed by the 'maxdev=xx' module option. This driver can
	  also be built as a module. If so, the module will be called slcan.

config CAN_DEV
	tristate "Platform CAN drivers with Netlink support"
	default y
	---help---
	  Enables the common framework for platform CAN drivers with Netlink
	  support. This is the standard library for CAN drivers.
	  If unsure, say Y.

if CAN_DEV

config CAN_CALC_BITTIMING
	bool "CAN bit-timing calculation"
	default y
	---help---
	  If enabled, CAN bit-timing parameters will be calculated for the
	  bit-rate specified via Netlink argument "bitrate" when the device
	  get started. This works fine for the most common CAN controllers
	  with standard bit-rates but may fail for exotic bit-rates or CAN
	  source clock frequencies. Disabling saves some space, but then the
	  bit-timing parameters must be specified directly using the Netlink
	  arguments "tq", "prop_seg", "phase_seg1", "phase_seg2" and "sjw".
	  If unsure, say Y.

config CAN_LEDS
	bool "Enable LED triggers for Netlink based drivers"
	depends on LEDS_CLASS
	select LEDS_TRIGGERS
	---help---
	  This option adds two LED triggers for packet receive and transmit
	  events on each supported CAN device.

	  Say Y here if you are working on a system with led-class supported
	  LEDs and you want to use them as canbus activity indicators.

config CAN_AT91
	tristate "Atmel AT91 onchip CAN controller"
	depends on ARCH_AT91 || COMPILE_TEST
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the SoC CAN controller in Atmel's AT91SAM9263
	  and AT91SAM9X5 processors.

config CAN_TI_HECC
	depends on ARM
	tristate "TI High End CAN Controller"
	---help---
	  Driver for TI HECC (High End CAN Controller) module found on many
	  TI devices. The device specifications are available from www.ti.com

config CAN_BFIN
	depends on BF534 || BF536 || BF537 || BF538 || BF539 || BF54x
	tristate "Analog Devices Blackfin on-chip CAN"
	---help---
	  Driver for the Analog Devices Blackfin on-chip CAN controllers

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called bfin_can.

config CAN_JANZ_ICAN3
	tristate "Janz VMOD-ICAN3 Intelligent CAN controller"
	depends on MFD_JANZ_CMODIO
	---help---
	  Driver for Janz VMOD-ICAN3 Intelligent CAN controller module, which
	  connects to a MODULbus carrier board.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be
	  called janz-ican3.ko.

config CAN_FLEXCAN
	tristate "Support for Freescale FLEXCAN based chips"
	depends on ARM || PPC
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to support for Freescale FlexCAN.

config PCH_CAN
	tristate "Intel EG20T PCH CAN controller"
	depends on PCI && (X86_32 || COMPILE_TEST)
	---help---
	  This driver is for PCH CAN of Topcliff (Intel EG20T PCH) which
	  is an IOH for x86 embedded processor (Intel Atom E6xx series).
	  This driver can access CAN bus.

config CAN_GRCAN
	tristate "Aeroflex Gaisler GRCAN and GRHCAN CAN devices"
	depends on OF
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to use Aeroflex Gaisler GRCAN or GRHCAN.
	  Note that the driver supports little endian, even though little
	  endian syntheses of the cores would need some modifications on
	  the hardware level to work.

config CAN_RCAR
	tristate "Renesas R-Car CAN controller"
	depends on ARM
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to use CAN controller found on Renesas R-Car
	  SoCs.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called rcar_can.

config CAN_XILINXCAN
	tristate "Xilinx CAN"
	depends on ARCH_ZYNQ || MICROBLAZE || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on COMMON_CLK && HAS_IOMEM
	---help---
	  Xilinx CAN driver. This driver supports both soft AXI CAN IP and
	  Zynq CANPS IP.

config CAN_DEBUG_DEVICES
	bool "CAN devices debugging messages"
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want the CAN device drivers to produce a bunch of
	  debug messages to the system log.  Select this if you are having
	  a problem with CAN support and want to see more of what is going
	  on.
