menuconfig POWER_RESET
	bool "Board level reset or power off"
	help
	  Provides a number of drivers which either reset a complete board
	  or shut it down, by manipulating the main power supply on the board.

	  Say Y here to enable board reset and power off

if POWER_RESET

	bool "Atmel AT91 poweroff driver"
	depends on MACH_AT91
	default SOC_AT91SAM9 || SOC_SAMA5
	help
	  This driver supports poweroff for Atmel AT91SAM9 and SAMA5
	  SoCs

config POWER_RESET_AT91_RESET
	bool "Atmel AT91 reset driver"
	depends on MACH_AT91
	default SOC_AT91SAM9 || SOC_SAMA5
	help
	  This driver supports restart for Atmel AT91SAM9 and SAMA5
	  SoCs

config POWER_RESET_AXXIA
	bool "LSI Axxia reset driver"
	depends on ARCH_AXXIA
	help
	  This driver supports restart for Axxia SoC.

	  Say Y if you have an Axxia family SoC.

config POWER_RESET_GPIO
	bool "GPIO power-off driver"
	depends on OF_GPIO
	help
	  This driver supports turning off your board via a GPIO line.
	  If your board needs a GPIO high/low to power down, say Y and
	  create a binding in your devicetree.

config POWER_RESET_MSM
	bool "Qualcomm MSM power-off driver"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	help
	  Power off and restart support for Qualcomm boards.

config POWER_RESET_QNAP
	bool "QNAP power-off driver"
	depends on OF_GPIO && PLAT_ORION
	help
	  This driver supports turning off QNAP NAS devices by sending
	  commands to the microcontroller which controls the main power.

	  Say Y if you have a QNAP NAS.

config POWER_RESET_RESTART
	bool "Restart power-off driver"
	depends on ARM
