	  Say Y here to enable the power sequencing driver for Qualcomm
	  WCN Bluetooth/WLAN chipsets.

	  Typically, a package from the Qualcomm WCN family contains the BT
	  and WLAN modules whose power is controlled by the PMU module. As the
	  former two share the power-up sequence which is executed by the PMU,
	  this driver is needed for correct power control or else we'd risk not
	  respecting the required delays between enabling Bluetooth and WLAN.
