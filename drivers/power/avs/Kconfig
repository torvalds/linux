menuconfig POWER_AVS
	bool "Adaptive Voltage Scaling class support"
	help
	  AVS is a power management technique which finely controls the
	  operating voltage of a device in order to optimize (i.e. reduce)
	  its power consumption.
	  At a given operating point the voltage is adapted depending on
	  static factors (chip manufacturing process) and dynamic factors
	  (temperature depending performance).
	  AVS is also called SmartReflex on OMAP devices.

	  Say Y here to enable Adaptive Voltage Scaling class support.

config ROCKCHIP_IODOMAIN
        tristate "Rockchip IO domain support"
        depends on ARCH_ROCKCHIP && OF
        help
          Say y here to enable support io domains on Rockchip SoCs. It is
          necessary for the io domain setting of the SoC to match the
          voltage supplied by the regulators.
