menuconfig AUXDISPLAY
	bool "Auxiliary Display support"
	---help---
	  Say Y here to get to see options for auxiliary display drivers.
	  This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled.

if AUXDISPLAY

config KS0108
	tristate "KS0108 LCD Controller"
	depends on PARPORT_PC
	default n
	---help---
	  If you have a LCD controlled by one or more KS0108
	  controllers, say Y. You will need also another more specific
	  driver for your LCD.

	  Depends on Parallel Port support. If you say Y at
	  parport, you will be able to compile this as a module (M)
	  and built-in as well (Y).

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called ks0108.

	  If unsure, say N.

config KS0108_PORT
	hex "Parallel port where the LCD is connected"
	depends on KS0108
	default 0x378
	---help---
	  The address of the parallel port where the LCD is connected.

	  The first  standard parallel port address is 0x378.
	  The second standard parallel port address is 0x278.
	  The third  standard parallel port address is 0x3BC.

	  You can specify a different address if you need.

	  If you don't know what I'm talking about, load the parport module,
	  and execute "dmesg" or "cat /proc/ioports". You can see there how
	  many parallel ports are present and which address each one has.

	  Usually you only need to use 0x378.

	  If you compile this as a module, you can still override this
	  using the module parameters.

config KS0108_DELAY
	int "Delay between each control writing (microseconds)"
	depends on KS0108
	default "2"
	---help---
	  Amount of time the ks0108 should wait between each control write
	  to the parallel port.

	  If your LCD seems to miss random writings, increment this.

	  If you don't know what I'm talking about, ignore it.

	  If you compile this as a module, you can still override this
	  value using the module parameters.

config CFAG12864B
	tristate "CFAG12864B LCD"
	depends on X86
	depends on FB
	depends on KS0108
	select FB_SYS_FILLRECT
	select FB_SYS_COPYAREA
	select FB_SYS_IMAGEBLIT
	select FB_SYS_FOPS
	default n
	---help---
	  If you have a Crystalfontz 128x64 2-color LCD, cfag12864b Series,
	  say Y. You also need the ks0108 LCD Controller driver.

	  For help about how to wire your LCD to the parallel port,
	  check Documentation/auxdisplay/cfag12864b

	  Depends on the x86 arch and the framebuffer support.

	  The LCD framebuffer driver can be attached to a console.
	  It will work fine. However, you can't attach it to the fbdev driver
	  of the xorg server.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here:
	  the modules will be called cfag12864b and cfag12864bfb.

	  If unsure, say N.

config CFAG12864B_RATE
       int "Refresh rate (hertz)"
	depends on CFAG12864B
	default "20"
	---help---
	  Refresh rate of the LCD.

	  As the LCD is not memory mapped, the driver has to make the work by
	  software. This means you should be careful setting this value higher.
	  If your CPUs are really slow or you feel the system is slowed down,
	  decrease the value.

	  Be careful modifying this value to a very high value:
	  You can freeze the computer, or the LCD maybe can't draw as fast as you
	  are requesting.

	  If you don't know what I'm talking about, ignore it.

	  If you compile this as a module, you can still override this
	  value using the module parameters.

config IMG_ASCII_LCD
	tristate "Imagination Technologies ASCII LCD Display"
	default y if MIPS_MALTA || MIPS_SEAD3
	select SYSCON
	help
	  Enable this to support the simple ASCII LCD displays found on
	  development boards such as the MIPS Boston, MIPS Malta & MIPS SEAD3
	  from Imagination Technologies.

config HT16K33
	tristate "Holtek Ht16K33 LED controller with keyscan"
	depends on FB && OF && I2C && INPUT
	select FB_SYS_FOPS
	select FB_CFB_FILLRECT
	select FB_CFB_COPYAREA
	select FB_CFB_IMAGEBLIT
	select INPUT_MATRIXKMAP
	select FB_BACKLIGHT
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for Holtek HT16K33, RAM mapping 16*8
	  LED controller driver with keyscan.
