	tristate "ARM AMBA Multimedia Card Interface support"
	depends on ARM_AMBA
	help
	  This selects the ARM(R) AMBA(R) PrimeCell Multimedia Card
	  Interface (PL180 and PL181) support.  If you have an ARM(R)
	  platform with a Multimedia Card slot, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_PXA
	tristate "Intel PXA25x/26x/27x Multimedia Card Interface support"
	depends on ARCH_PXA
	help
	  This selects the Intel(R) PXA(R) Multimedia card Interface.
	  If you have a PXA(R) platform with a Multimedia Card slot,
	  say Y or M here.

config MMC_SDHCI
	tristate "Secure Digital Host Controller Interface support"
	depends on HAS_DMA
	help
	  This selects the generic Secure Digital Host Controller Interface.
	  It is used by manufacturers such as Texas Instruments(R), Ricoh(R)
	  and Toshiba(R). Most controllers found in laptops are of this type.

	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here. You
	  also need to enable an appropriate bus interface.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_SDHCI_IO_ACCESSORS
	bool
	depends on MMC_SDHCI
	help
	  This is silent Kconfig symbol that is selected by the drivers that
	  need to overwrite SDHCI IO memory accessors.

config MMC_SDHCI_BIG_ENDIAN_32BIT_BYTE_SWAPPER
	bool
	select MMC_SDHCI_IO_ACCESSORS
	help
	  This option is selected by drivers running on big endian hosts
	  and performing I/O to a SDHCI controller through a bus that
	  implements a hardware byte swapper using a 32-bit datum.
	  This endian mapping mode is called "data invariance" and
	  has the effect of scrambling the addresses and formats of data
	  accessed in sizes other than the datum size.

	  This is the case for the Freescale eSDHC and Nintendo Wii SDHCI.

config MMC_RICOH_MMC
	bool "Ricoh MMC Controller Disabler  (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on MMC_SDHCI_PCI
	help
	  This adds a pci quirk to disable Ricoh MMC Controller. This
	  proprietary controller is unnecessary because the SDHCI driver
	  supports MMC cards on the SD controller, but if it is not
	  disabled, it will steal the MMC cards away - rendering them
	  useless. It is safe to select this even if you don't
	  have a Ricoh based card reader.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  'Misc devices: TI Flash Media PCI74xx/PCI76xx host adapter support
	  (TIFM_7XX1)'.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	  Some systems access MMC/SD/SDIO cards using a SPI controller
	  instead of using a "native" MMC/SD/SDIO controller.  This has a

	  Use PIO to transfer data between memory and the hardware.

	  PIO is slower than DMA as it requires CPU instructions to
	  move the data. This has been the traditional default for
	  the S3C MCI driver.

config MMC_S3C_DMA
	bool "Use DMA transfers only (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Use DMA to transfer data between memory and the hardare.
