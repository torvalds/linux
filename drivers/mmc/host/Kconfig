	  also need to enable an appropriate bus interface.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_SDHCI_IO_ACCESSORS

	help
	  This option is selected by drivers running on big endian hosts
	  and performing I/O to a SDHCI controller through a bus that
	  implements a hardware byte swapper using a 32-bit datum.

	  supports MMC cards on the SD controller, but if it is not
