config ARCH_WANT_OPTIONAL_GPIOLIB
	bool
	help
	  Select this config option from the architecture Kconfig, if
	  it is possible to use gpiolib on the architecture, but let the
	  user decide whether to actually build it or not.
	  Select this instead of ARCH_REQUIRE_GPIOLIB, if your architecture does
	  not depend on GPIOs being available, but rather let the user
	  decide whether he needs it or not.

config ARCH_REQUIRE_GPIOLIB
	bool
	select GPIOLIB
	help
	  Platforms select gpiolib if they use this infrastructure
	  for all their GPIOs, usually starting with ones integrated
	  into SOC processors.
	  Selecting this from the architecture code will cause the gpiolib
	  code to always get built in.



menuconfig GPIOLIB
	bool "GPIO Support"
	depends on ARCH_WANT_OPTIONAL_GPIOLIB || ARCH_REQUIRE_GPIOLIB
	select GENERIC_GPIO
	help
	  This enables GPIO support through the generic GPIO library.
	  You only need to enable this, if you also want to enable
	  one or more of the GPIO drivers below.

	  If unsure, say N.

if GPIOLIB

config DEBUG_GPIO
	bool "Debug GPIO calls"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to add some extra checks and diagnostics to GPIO calls.
	  These checks help ensure that GPIOs have been properly initialized
	  before they are used, and that sleeping calls are not made from
	  non-sleeping contexts.  They can make bitbanged serial protocols
	  slower.  The diagnostics help catch the type of setup errors
	  that are most common when setting up new platforms or boards.

config GPIO_SYSFS
	bool "/sys/class/gpio/... (sysfs interface)"
	depends on SYSFS && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Say Y here to add a sysfs interface for GPIOs.

	  This is mostly useful to work around omissions in a system's
	  kernel support.  Those are common in custom and semicustom
	  hardware assembled using standard kernels with a minimum of
	  custom patches.  In those cases, userspace code may import
	  a given GPIO from the kernel, if no kernel driver requested it.

	  Kernel drivers may also request that a particular GPIO be
	  exported to userspace; this can be useful when debugging.

	  Say yes here to support the MAX7319, MAX7320-7327 series of I2C
	  Port Expanders. Each IO port on these chips has a fixed role of

	  Input and Output (designed by 'P'). The combinations are listed
	  below:

	  8 bits:	max7319 (8I), max7320 (8O), max7321 (8P),

	  16 bits:	max7324 (8I8O), max7325 (8P8O),

	  Say yes here to provide access to most "quasi-bidirectional" I2C
	  GPIO expanders used for additional digital outputs or inputs.

	            pca9670, pca9672, pca9674, pca9674a,

	  16 bits:  pcf8575, pcf8575c, pca8575,
	            pca9671, pca9673, pca9675

	  Your board setup code will need to declare the expanders in
	  use, and assign numbers to the GPIOs they expose.  Those GPIOs
	  can then be used from drivers and other kernel code, just like
	  other GPIOs, but only accessible from task contexts.

	  This driver provides an in-kernel interface to those GPIOs using
	  platform-neutral GPIO calls.
