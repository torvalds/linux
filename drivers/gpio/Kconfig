	  Say Y here to add a sysfs interface for GPIOs.

	  This is mostly useful to work around omissions in a system's
	  kernel support.  Those are common in custom and semicustom
	  hardware assembled using standard kernels with a minimum of
	  custom patches.  In those cases, userspace code may import
	  a given GPIO from the kernel, if no kernel driver requested it.

	  Kernel drivers may also request that a particular GPIO be
	  exported to userspace; this can be useful when debugging.
