	  Generic Thermal Sysfs driver offers a generic mechanism for
	  thermal management. Usually it's made up of one or more thermal
	  zone and cooling device.
	  Each thermal zone contains its own temperature, trip points,
	  cooling devices.
	  All platforms with ACPI thermal support can use this driver.
	  If you want this support, you should say Y here.
