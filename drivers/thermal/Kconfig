menuconfig THERMAL
	tristate "Generic Thermal sysfs driver"
	help
	  Generic Thermal Sysfs driver offers a generic mechanism for
	  thermal management. Usually it's made up of one or more thermal
	  zone and cooling device.
	  Each thermal zone contains its own temperature, trip points,
	  cooling devices.
	  All platforms with ACPI thermal support can use this driver.
	  If you want this support, you should say Y or M here.

if THERMAL

config THERMAL_HWMON
	bool
	prompt "Expose thermal sensors as hwmon device"
	depends on HWMON=y || HWMON=THERMAL
	default y
	help
	  In case a sensor is registered with the thermal
	  framework, this option will also register it
	  as a hwmon. The sensor will then have the common
	  hwmon sysfs interface.

	  Say 'Y' here if you want all thermal sensors to
	  have hwmon sysfs interface too.

config THERMAL_OF
	bool
	prompt "APIs to parse thermal data out of device tree"
	depends on OF
	default y
	help
	  This options provides helpers to add the support to
	  read and parse thermal data definitions out of the
	  device tree blob.

	  Say 'Y' here if you need to build thermal infrastructure
	  based on device tree.

config THERMAL_WRITABLE_TRIPS
	bool "Enable writable trip points"
	help
	  This option allows the system integrator to choose whether
	  trip temperatures can be changed from userspace. The
	  writable trips need to be specified when setting up the
	  thermal zone but the choice here takes precedence.

	  Say 'Y' here if you would like to allow userspace tools to
	  change trip temperatures.

choice
	prompt "Default Thermal governor"
	default THERMAL_DEFAULT_GOV_STEP_WISE
	help
	  This option sets which thermal governor shall be loaded at
	  startup. If in doubt, select 'step_wise'.

config THERMAL_DEFAULT_GOV_STEP_WISE
	bool "step_wise"
	select THERMAL_GOV_STEP_WISE
	help
	  Use the step_wise governor as default. This throttles the
	  devices one step at a time.

config THERMAL_DEFAULT_GOV_FAIR_SHARE
	bool "fair_share"
	select THERMAL_GOV_FAIR_SHARE
	help
	  Use the fair_share governor as default. This throttles the
	  devices based on their 'contribution' to a zone. The
	  contribution should be provided through platform data.

config THERMAL_DEFAULT_GOV_USER_SPACE
	bool "user_space"
	select THERMAL_GOV_USER_SPACE
	help
	  Select this if you want to let the user space manage the
	  platform thermals.

config THERMAL_DEFAULT_GOV_POWER_ALLOCATOR
	bool "power_allocator"
	select THERMAL_GOV_POWER_ALLOCATOR
	help
	  Select this if you want to control temperature based on
	  system and device power allocation. This governor can only
	  operate on cooling devices that implement the power API.

endchoice

config THERMAL_GOV_FAIR_SHARE
	bool "Fair-share thermal governor"
	help
	  Enable this to manage platform thermals using fair-share governor.

config THERMAL_GOV_STEP_WISE
	bool "Step_wise thermal governor"
	help
	  Enable this to manage platform thermals using a simple linear
	  governor.

config THERMAL_GOV_BANG_BANG
	bool "Bang Bang thermal governor"
	default n
	help
	  Enable this to manage platform thermals using bang bang governor.

	  Say 'Y' here if you want to use two point temperature regulation
	  used for fans without throttling.  Some fan drivers depend on this
	  governor to be enabled (e.g. acerhdf).

config THERMAL_GOV_USER_SPACE
	bool "User_space thermal governor"
	help
	  Enable this to let the user space manage the platform thermals.

config THERMAL_GOV_POWER_ALLOCATOR
	bool "Power allocator thermal governor"
	help
	  Enable this to manage platform thermals by dynamically
	  allocating and limiting power to devices.

config CPU_THERMAL
	bool "generic cpu cooling support"
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	depends on THERMAL_OF
	help
	  This implements the generic cpu cooling mechanism through frequency
	  reduction. An ACPI version of this already exists
	  (drivers/acpi/processor_thermal.c).
	  This will be useful for platforms using the generic thermal interface
	  and not the ACPI interface.

	  If you want this support, you should say Y here.

config CLOCK_THERMAL
	bool "Generic clock cooling support"
	depends on COMMON_CLK
	depends on PM_OPP
	help
	  This entry implements the generic clock cooling mechanism through
	  frequency clipping. Typically used to cool off co-processors. The
	  device that is configured to use this cooling mechanism will be
	  controlled to reduce clock frequency whenever temperature is high.

config DEVFREQ_THERMAL
	bool "Generic device cooling support"
	depends on PM_DEVFREQ
	depends on PM_OPP
	help
	  This implements the generic devfreq cooling mechanism through
	  frequency reduction for devices using devfreq.

	  This will throttle the device by limiting the maximum allowed DVFS
	  frequency corresponding to the cooling level.

	  In order to use the power extensions of the cooling device,
	  devfreq should use the simple_ondemand governor.

	  If you want this support, you should say Y here.

config THERMAL_EMULATION
	bool "Thermal emulation mode support"
	help
	  Enable this option to make a emul_temp sysfs node in thermal zone
	  directory to support temperature emulation. With emulation sysfs node,
	  user can manually input temperature and test the different trip
	  threshold behaviour for simulation purpose.

	  WARNING: Be careful while enabling this option on production systems,
	  because userland can easily disable the thermal policy by simply
	  flooding this sysfs node with low temperature values.
