	help
	  This driver provides support for the PS/2 ports on PA-RISC machines
	  over which HP PS/2 keyboards and PS/2 mice may be connected.
	  If you use these devices, you'll need to say Y here.

	  It's safe to enable this driver, so if unsure, say Y.

config HP_SDC
	tristate "HP System Device Controller i8042 Support"
	depends on (GSC || HP300) && SERIO
	default y
	---help---
	  This option enables support for the "System Device
	  Controller", an i8042 carrying microcode to manage a
	  few miscellaneous devices on some Hewlett Packard systems.
	  The SDC itself contains a 10ms resolution timer/clock capable
	  of delivering interrupts on a periodic and one-shot basis.
	  The SDC may also be connected to a battery-backed real-time
	  clock, a basic audio waveform generator, and an HP-HIL Master
	  Link Controller serving up to seven input devices.

	  By itself this option is rather useless, but enabling it will
	  enable selection of drivers for the abovementioned devices.
	  It is, however, incompatible with the old, reliable HIL keyboard
	  driver, and the new HIL driver is experimental, so if you plan
	  to use a HIL keyboard as your primary keyboard, you may wish
	  to keep using that driver until the new HIL drivers have had
	  more testing.

	  Say Y here if you have SGI O2 workstation and want to use its

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called maceps2.

config SERIO_LIBPS2
	tristate "PS/2 driver library" if EMBEDDED
	help
	  Say Y here if you are using a driver for device connected
	  to a PS/2 port, such as PS/2 mouse or standard AT keyboard.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called libps2.

config SERIO_RAW
	tristate "Raw access to serio ports"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to have raw access to serio ports, such as
	  AUX ports on i8042 keyboard controller. Each serio port that is
	  bound to this driver will be accessible via a char device with
	  major 10 and dynamically allocated minor. The driver will try
	  allocating minor 1 (that historically corresponds to /dev/psaux)
	  first. To bind this driver to a serio port use sysfs interface:

	      echo -n "serio_raw" > /sys/bus/serio/devices/serioX/drvctl

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called serio_raw.
