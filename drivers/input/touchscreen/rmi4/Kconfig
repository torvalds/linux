config RMI4_BUS
	bool "Synaptics RMI4 bus support"
	depends on TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_RMI4_I2C_RK
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support the Synaptics RMI4 bus.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  This feature is not currently available as
	  a loadable module.

config RMI4_DEBUG
	bool "Synaptics RMI4 debugging"
	depends on RMI4_BUS
	help
	  Say Y here to enable debug feature in the RMI4 driver.

	  Note that the RMI4 driver debug features can generate a lot of
	  output (potentially clogging up your dmesg output) and generally
	  slow down driver operation.  It's recommended to enable them only
	  if you are actively developing/debugging RMI4 features.

	  If unsure, say N.

config RMI4_I2C
	bool "RMI4 I2C Support"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && I2C
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support RMI4 devices connected to an I2C
	  bus.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  This feature is not currently available as a loadable module.

config RMI4_I2C_SCL_RATE
	int "RMI4 I2C SCL RATE Support"
	depends on RMI4_I2C

config RMI4_SPI
	bool "RMI4 SPI Support"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && SPI
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support RMI4 devices connected to an SPI
	  bus.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  This feature is not currently available as a loadable module.

config RMI4_GENERIC
	bool "RMI4 Generic driver"
	depends on RMI4_BUS
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support generic RMI4 devices.

	  This is pretty much required if you want to do anything useful with
	  your RMI device.

	  This feature is not currently available as a loadable module.


config RMI4_F1A
	tristate "RMI4 Function 1A (capacitive button sensor)"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && RMI4_GENERIC
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 function 1A.

	  Function 1A provides self testing for touchscreens and touchpads.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-f1a.

config RMI4_F09
	tristate "RMI4 Function 09 (self testing)"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && RMI4_GENERIC
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 function 09.

	  Function 09 provides self testing for touchscreens and touchpads.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-f09.

config RMI4_F11
	tristate "RMI4 Function 11 (2D pointing)"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && RMI4_GENERIC
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 function 11.

	  Function 11 provides 2D multifinger pointing for touchscreens and
	  touchpads.  For sensors that support relative pointing, F11 also
	  provides mouse input.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-f11.

config RMI4_F11_PEN
	bool "RMI4 F11 Pen Support"
	depends on RMI4_F11
	help
	  Say Y here to add support for pen input to RMI4 function 11.

	  If this feature is enabled, when pen inputs are detected they
	  will be reported to the input stream as MT_TOOL_PEN.  Otherwise,
	  pens will be treated the same as fingers.

	  Not all UI implementations deal gracefully with pen discrimination.
	  If your system is not recognizing pen touches and you know your
	  sensor supports pen input, you probably want to turn this feature
	  off.

config RMI4_VIRTUAL_BUTTON
	tristate "RMI4 Vitual Button"
	depends on RMI4_F11
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 virtual button to F11.

	  The virtual button feature implement the virtual button device in
	  certain RMI4 touch sensors.

	  This works only if your sensor supports F11 gestures.

config RMI4_F17
	tristate "RMI4 Function 17 (pointing sticks)"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && RMI4_GENERIC
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 function 17.

	  Function 19 provides support for capacitive and resistive
	  pointing sticks.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-f17.

config RMI4_F19
	tristate "RMI4 Function 19 (0D pointing)"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && RMI4_GENERIC
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 function 19.

	  Function 19 provides support for capacitive buttons for sensors
	  that implement capacitive buttons.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-f19.
	  
config RMI4_F21
	tristate "RMI4 Function 21 (2D Force)"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && RMI4_GENERIC
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 function 21.

	  Function 21 provides 2D Force Sensing for ForcePad products.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-f21.

config RMI4_F34
	tristate "RMI4 Function 34 (device reflash)"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && RMI4_GENERIC
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to add support for RMI4 function 34.

	  Function 34 provides firmware upgrade capability for your sensor.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rmi-f34.
config RMI4_REFLASH_WHEN_BOOT
	tristate "RMI4 Function 34 (device reflash when system boot)"
	depends on RMI4_BUS && RMI4_GENERIC

	  module will be called rmi-f54.

config RMI4_DEV
	tristate "Synaptics direct RMI device support (rmidev)"
	depends on GPIO_SYSFS && (RMI4_I2C || RMI4_SPI)
	help
	  Say Y here to add support for rmidev.

	  The rmidev feature implements a character device providing access
	  to RMI4 sensor register maps.
