config MOUSE_SYNAPTICS_I2C
	tristate "Synaptics I2C Touchpad support"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  This driver supports Synaptics I2C touchpad controller on eXeda
	  mobile device.
	  The device will not work the synaptics X11 driver because
	  (i) it  reports only relative coordinates and has no capabilities
	  to report absolute coordinates
	  (ii) the eXeda device itself uses Xfbdev as X Server and it does
	  not allow using xf86-input-* drivers.

	  Say y here if you have eXeda device and want to use a Synaptics
	  I2C Touchpad.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called synaptics_i2c.

	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use a Synaptics USB touchpad or pointing
	  stick.

	  While these devices emulate an USB mouse by default and can be used
	  with standard usbhid driver, this driver, together with its X.Org
	  counterpart, allows you to fully utilize capabilities of the device.
	  More information can be found at:
	  <http://jan-steinhoff.de/linux/synaptics-usb.html>

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called synaptics_usb.

config MOUSE_NAVPOINT_PXA27x
	tristate "Synaptics NavPoint (PXA27x SSP/SPI)"
	depends on PXA27x && PXA_SSP
	help
	  This driver adds support for the Synaptics NavPoint touchpad connected
	  to a PXA27x SSP port in SPI slave mode. The device emulates a mouse;
	  a tap or tap-and-a-half drag gesture emulates the left mouse button.
	  For example, use the xf86-input-evdev driver for an X pointing device.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called navpoint.
