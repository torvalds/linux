	  with the synaptics X11 driver to provide acceleration and
	  scrolling in X11.

	  For further information, see

	  Air (JAN2008) and Macbook Pro Penryn (FEB2008) laptops.

	  It is also found in the IPhone (2007) and Ipod Touch (2008).

	  This driver provides multitouch functionality together with
	  the synaptics X11 driver.

	help
	  This driver supports Synaptics I2C touchpad controller on eXeda
	  mobile device.
	  The device will not work the synaptics X11 driver because
	  (i) it  reports only relative coordinates and has no capabilities
	  to report absolute coordinates
	  (ii) the eXeda device itself uses Xfbdev as X Server and it does
	  not allow using xf86-input-* drivers.

	  Say y here if you have eXeda device and want to use a Synaptics
	  I2C Touchpad.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called synaptics_i2c.
