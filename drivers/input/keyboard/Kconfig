	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use a standard AT or PS/2 keyboard. Usually
	  you'll need this, unless you have a different type keyboard (USB, ADB
	  or other). This also works for AT and PS/2 keyboards connected over a
	  PS/2 to serial converter.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	default y
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a PA-RISC machine and want to use an AT or
	  PS/2 keyboard, and your keyboard uses keycodes that are specific to
	  PA-RISC keyboards.

	default n
	help
	  If you have an RDI PrecisionBook, say Y here if you want to use its
	  built-in keyboard (as opposed to an external keyboard).

	  The PrecisionBook has five keys that conflict with those used by most
	  AT and PS/2 keyboards. These are as follows:

	    PrecisionBook    Standard AT or PS/2

	    F1               F12
	    Left Ctrl        Left Alt
	    Caps Lock        Left Ctrl
	    Right Ctrl       Caps Lock
	    Left             102nd key (the key to the right of Left Shift)

	  If you say N here, and use the PrecisionBook keyboard, then each key
	  in the left-hand column will be interpreted as the corresponding key
	  in the right-hand column.

	  If you say Y here, and use an external keyboard, then each key in the
	  right-hand column will be interpreted as the key shown in the
	  left-hand column.

config KEYBOARD_HIL_OLD

	depends on GSC
	default y
	help
	  The "Human Interface Loop" is a older, 8-channel USB-like
	  controller used in several Hewlett Packard models. This driver
	  was adapted from the one written for m68k/hp300, and implements
	  support for a keyboard attached to the HIL port, but not for
	  any other types of HIL input devices like mice or tablets.
	  However, it has been thoroughly tested and is stable.

	  If you want full HIL support including support for multiple
	  keyboards, mices and tablets, you have to enable the
	  "HP System Device Controller i8042 Support" in the input/serio
	  submenu.

config KEYBOARD_HIL
	tristate "HP HIL keyboard support"
	depends on GSC
	default y

	help
	  The "Human Interface Loop" is a older, 8-channel USB-like
	  controller used in several Hewlett Packard models.
	  This driver implements support for HIL-keyboards attached
	  to your machine, so normally you should say Y here.
