	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	select RTC_LIB
	help
	  Generic RTC class support. If you say yes here, you will
 	  be allowed to plug one or more RTCs to your system. You will
	  probably want to enable one of more of the interfaces below.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-class.

config RTC_HCTOSYS
	bool "Set system time from RTC on startup"
	depends on RTC_CLASS = y
	default y
	help
	  If you say yes here, the system time will be set using
	  the value read from the specified RTC device. This is useful
	  in order to avoid unnecessary fschk runs.

	depends on RTC_HCTOSYS = y
	default "rtc0"
	help
	  The RTC device that will be used as the source for
	  the system time, usually rtc0.

	  should handle DS1307, DS1337, DS1338, DS1339, DS1340, ST M41T00,
	  and probably other chips.  In some cases the RTC must already
	  have been initialized (by manufacturing or a bootloader).

	  The first seven registers on these chips hold an RTC, and other
	  registers may add features such as NVRAM, a trickle charger for
	  the RTC/NVRAM backup power, and alarms.  This driver may not
	  expose all those available chip features.

	  the time from the system clock.
	  You want this driver only if you are doing development
	  on the RTC subsystem. Please read the source code
