	help
	  Generic RTC class support. If you say yes here, you will
 	  be allowed to plug one or more RTCs to your system. You will
	  probably want to enable one or more of the interfaces below.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-core.

config RTC_HCTOSYS
	bool "Set system time from RTC on startup and resume"
	depends on RTC_CLASS = y
	default y
	help
	  If you say yes here, the system time (wall clock) will be set using
	  the value read from a specified RTC device. This is useful to avoid
	  unnecessary fsck runs at boot time, and to network better.

config RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE
	string "RTC used to set the system time"
	depends on RTC_HCTOSYS = y
	default "rtc0"
	help
	  The RTC device that will be used to (re)initialize the system
	  clock, usually rtc0. Initialization is done when the system
	  starts up, and when it resumes from a low power state. This
	  device should record time in UTC, since the kernel won't do
	  timezone correction.

	  The driver for this RTC device must be loaded before late_initcall
	  functions run, so it must usually be statically linked.

	  This clock should be battery-backed, so that it reads the correct
	  time when the system boots from a power-off state. Otherwise, your
	  system will need an external clock source (like an NTP server).

	  If the clock you specify here is not battery backed, it may still
	  be useful to reinitialize system time when resuming from system
	  sleep states. Do not specify an RTC here unless it stays powered
	  during all this system's supported sleep states.

config RTC_DEBUG
	bool "RTC debug support"
	depends on RTC_CLASS = y
	help
	  Say yes here to enable debugging support in the RTC framework
	  and individual RTC drivers.

	depends on PROC_FS
	default RTC_CLASS
	help
	  Say yes here if you want to use your first RTC through the proc
	  interface, /proc/driver/rtc. Other RTCs will not be available
	  through that API.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config RTC_INTF_DEV
	boolean "/dev/rtcN (character devices)"
	default RTC_CLASS
	help
	  Say yes here if you want to use your RTCs using the /dev
	  interfaces, which "udev" sets up as /dev/rtc0 through
	  /dev/rtcN.

	  You may want to set up a symbolic link so one of these
	  can be accessed as /dev/rtc, which is a name
	  expected by "hwclock" and some other programs. Recent
	  versions of "udev" are known to set up the symlink for you.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config RTC_INTF_DEV_UIE_EMUL
	bool "RTC UIE emulation on dev interface"
	depends on RTC_INTF_DEV
	help
	  Provides an emulation for RTC_UIE if the underlying rtc chip
	  driver does not expose RTC_UIE ioctls. Those requests generate
	  once-per-second update interrupts, used for synchronization.

	  The emulation code will read the time from the hardware
	  clock several times per second, please enable this option
	  only if you know that you really need it.

config RTC_DRV_TEST
	tristate "Test driver/device"
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the
	  RTC test driver. It's a software RTC which can be
	  used to test the RTC subsystem APIs. It gets
	  the time from the system clock.
	  You want this driver only if you are doing development
	  on the RTC subsystem. Please read the source code
	  for further details.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module

	  must already have been initialized (by manufacturing or a
	  bootloader).

	  The first seven registers on these chips hold an RTC, and other
	  registers may add features such as NVRAM, a trickle charger for
	  the RTC/NVRAM backup power, and alarms. NVRAM is visible in

	  If you say yes here you get support for the Philips PCF8583
	  RTC chip found on Acorn RiscPCs. This driver supports the

	  counter) to be used as a RTC.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-au1xxx.

config RTC_DRV_BFIN
	tristate "Blackfin On-Chip RTC"
	depends on BLACKFIN && !BF561
	help
	  If you say yes here you will get support for the
	  Blackfin On-Chip Real Time Clock.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-bfin.

config RTC_DRV_RS5C313
	tristate "Ricoh RS5C313"
	depends on SH_LANDISK
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the Ricoh RS5C313 RTC chips.

config RTC_DRV_GENERIC
	tristate "Generic RTC support"
	# Please consider writing a new RTC driver instead of using the generic
	# RTC abstraction
	depends on PARISC || M68K || PPC
	help
	  Say Y or M here to enable RTC support on systems using the generic
	  RTC abstraction. If you do not know what you are doing, you should
	  just say Y.

config RTC_DRV_PXA
       tristate "PXA27x/PXA3xx"
       depends on ARCH_PXA
       help
         If you say Y here you will get access to the real time clock
         built into your PXA27x or PXA3xx CPU.

         This RTC driver uses PXA RTC registers available since pxa27x
         series (RDxR, RYxR) instead of legacy RCNR, RTAR.


config RTC_DRV_SUN4V
	bool "SUN4V Hypervisor RTC"
	depends on SPARC64
	help
	  If you say Y here you will get support for the Hypervisor
	  based RTC on SUN4V systems.

config RTC_DRV_STARFIRE
	bool "Starfire RTC"
	depends on SPARC64
	help
	  If you say Y here you will get support for the RTC found on
	  Starfire systems.

config RTC_DRV_TX4939
	tristate "TX4939 SoC"
	depends on SOC_TX4939
	help
	  Driver for the internal RTC (Realtime Clock) module found on
	  Toshiba TX4939 SoC.

config RTC_DRV_MV
	tristate "Marvell SoC RTC"
	depends on ARCH_KIRKWOOD
	help
	  If you say yes here you will get support for the in-chip RTC
	  that can be found in some of Marvell's SoC devices, such as
	  the Kirkwood 88F6281 and 88F6192.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-mv.

config RTC_DRV_PS3
	tristate "PS3 RTC"
	depends on PPC_PS3
	help
	  If you say yes here you will get support for the RTC on PS3.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-ps3.
