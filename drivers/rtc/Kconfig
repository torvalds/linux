	  Generic RTC class support. If you say yes here, you will
	  be allowed to plug one or more RTCs to your system. You will
	  probably want to enable one or more of the interfaces below.

config RTC_HCTOSYS
	bool "Set system time from RTC on startup and resume"
	default y
	help
	  If you say yes here, the system time (wall clock) will be set using
	  the value read from a specified RTC device. This is useful to avoid
	  unnecessary fsck runs at boot time, and to network better.

config RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE
	string "RTC used to set the system time"
	depends on RTC_HCTOSYS
	default "rtc0"
	help
	  The RTC device that will be used to (re)initialize the system
	  clock, usually rtc0. Initialization is done when the system
	  starts up, and when it resumes from a low power state. This
	  device should record time in UTC, since the kernel won't do
	  timezone correction.

	  The driver for this RTC device must be loaded before late_initcall
	  functions run, so it must usually be statically linked.

	  This clock should be battery-backed, so that it reads the correct
	  time when the system boots from a power-off state. Otherwise, your
	  system will need an external clock source (like an NTP server).

	  If the clock you specify here is not battery backed, it may still
	  be useful to reinitialize system time when resuming from system
	  sleep states. Do not specify an RTC here unless it stays powered
	  during all this system's supported sleep states.

config RTC_SYSTOHC
	bool "Set the RTC time based on NTP synchronization"
	default y
	help
	  If you say yes here, the system time (wall clock) will be stored
	  in the RTC specified by RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE approximately every 11
	  minutes if userspace reports synchronized NTP status.

config RTC_SYSTOHC_DEVICE
	string "RTC used to synchronize NTP adjustment"
	depends on RTC_SYSTOHC
	default RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE if RTC_HCTOSYS
	default "rtc0"
	help
	  The RTC device used for NTP synchronization. The main difference
	  between RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE and RTC_SYSTOHC_DEVICE is that this
	  one can sleep when setting time, because it runs in the workqueue
	  context.

config RTC_DEBUG
	bool "RTC debug support"
	help
	  Say yes here to enable debugging support in the RTC framework
	  and individual RTC drivers.

	  Say yes here if you want to use your system clock RTC through
	  the proc interface, /proc/driver/rtc.
	  Other RTCs will not be available through that API.
	  If there is no RTC for the system clock, then the first RTC(rtc0)
	  is used by default.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config RTC_INTF_DEV
	bool "/dev/rtcN (character devices)"
	default RTC_CLASS
	help
	  Say yes here if you want to use your RTCs using the /dev
	  interfaces, which "udev" sets up as /dev/rtc0 through
	  /dev/rtcN.

	  You may want to set up a symbolic link so one of these
	  can be accessed as /dev/rtc, which is a name
	  expected by "hwclock" and some other programs. Recent
	  versions of "udev" are known to set up the symlink for you.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config RTC_INTF_DEV_UIE_EMUL
	bool "RTC UIE emulation on dev interface"
	depends on RTC_INTF_DEV
	help
	  Provides an emulation for RTC_UIE if the underlying rtc chip
	  driver does not expose RTC_UIE ioctls. Those requests generate
	  once-per-second update interrupts, used for synchronization.

	  The emulation code will read the time from the hardware
	  clock several times per second, please enable this option
	  only if you know that you really need it.

config RTC_DRV_TEST
	tristate "Test driver/device"
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the
	  RTC test driver. It's a software RTC which can be
	  used to test the RTC subsystem APIs. It gets
	  the time from the system clock.
	  You want this driver only if you are doing development
	  on the RTC subsystem. Please read the source code
	  for further details.

	  If you say yes here you get support for various compatible RTC

	  EPSON RX-8025, Intersil ISL12057 and probably other chips. In some

	  registers may add features such as NVRAM, a trickle charger for

	  The DS1307 driver suffered from a bug where it was enabling the
	  century bit inconditionnally but never used it when reading the time.
	  It made the driver unable to support dates beyond 2099.
	  Setting this option will add proper support for the century bit but if
	  the time was previously set using a kernel predating this option,
	  reading the date will return a date in the next century.
	  To solve that, you could boot a kernel without this option set, set
