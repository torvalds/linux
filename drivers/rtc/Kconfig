	  Generic RTC class support. If you say yes here, you will
 	  be allowed to plug one or more RTCs to your system. You will
	  probably want to enable one of more of the interfaces below.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-class.

config RTC_HCTOSYS
	bool "Set system time from RTC on startup"
	depends on RTC_CLASS = y
	default y
	help
	  If you say yes here, the system time will be set using
	  the value read from the specified RTC device. This is useful
	  in order to avoid unnecessary fschk runs.

config RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE
	string "The RTC to read the time from"
	depends on RTC_HCTOSYS = y
	default "rtc0"
	help
	  The RTC device that will be used as the source for
	  the system time, usually rtc0.
