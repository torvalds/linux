config RTC_LIB

config RTC_CLASS
	tristate "RTC class"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	select RTC_LIB
	help
	  Generic RTC class support. If you say yes here, you will
 	  be allowed to plug one or more RTCs to your system. You will
	  probably want to enable one or more of the interfaces below.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-class.

config RTC_HCTOSYS
	bool "Set system time from RTC on startup"
	depends on RTC_CLASS = y
	default y
	help
	  If you say yes here, the system time will be set using
	  the value read from the specified RTC device. This is useful
	  in order to avoid unnecessary fsck runs.

config RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE
	string "The RTC to read the time from"
	depends on RTC_HCTOSYS = y
	default "rtc0"
	help
	  The RTC device that will be used as the source for
	  the system time, usually rtc0.

config RTC_DEBUG
	bool "RTC debug support"
	depends on RTC_CLASS = y
	help
	  Say yes here to enable debugging support in the RTC framework
	  and individual RTC drivers.

comment "RTC interfaces"
	depends on RTC_CLASS

config RTC_INTF_SYSFS
	tristate "sysfs"
	depends on RTC_CLASS && SYSFS
	default RTC_CLASS
	help
	  Say yes here if you want to use your RTCs using sysfs interfaces,
	  /sys/class/rtc/rtc0 through /sys/.../rtcN.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-sysfs.

config RTC_INTF_PROC
	tristate "proc"
	depends on RTC_CLASS && PROC_FS
	default RTC_CLASS
	help
	  Say yes here if you want to use your first RTC through the proc
	  interface, /proc/driver/rtc.  Other RTCs will not be available
	  through that API.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-proc.

config RTC_INTF_DEV
	tristate "dev"
	depends on RTC_CLASS
	default RTC_CLASS
	help
	  Say yes here if you want to use your RTCs using the /dev
	  interfaces, which "udev" sets up as /dev/rtc0 through
	  /dev/rtcN.  You may want to set up a symbolic link so one
	  of these can be accessed as /dev/rtc, which is a name
	  expected by "hwclock" and some other programs.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-dev.

config RTC_INTF_DEV_UIE_EMUL
	bool "RTC UIE emulation on dev interface"
	depends on RTC_INTF_DEV
	help
	  Provides an emulation for RTC_UIE if the underlaying rtc chip
	  driver does not expose RTC_UIE ioctls.  Those requests generate
	  once-per-second update interrupts, used for synchronization.

comment "RTC drivers"
	depends on RTC_CLASS

# this 'CMOS' RTC driver is arch dependent because <asm-generic/rtc.h>
# requires <asm/mc146818rtc.h> defining CMOS_READ/CMOS_WRITE, and a
# global rtc_lock ... it's not yet just another platform_device.

config RTC_DRV_CMOS
	tristate "PC-style 'CMOS' real time clock"
	depends on RTC_CLASS && (X86 || ALPHA || ARM26 || ARM \
		|| M32R || ATARI || POWERPC)
	help
	  Say "yes" here to get direct support for the real time clock
	  found in every PC or ACPI-based system, and some other boards.
	  Specifically the original MC146818, compatibles like those in
	  PC south bridges, the DS12887 or M48T86, some multifunction
	  or LPC bus chips, and so on.

	  Your system will need to define the platform device used by
	  this driver, otherwise it won't be accessible.  This means
	  you can safely enable this driver if you don't know whether
	  or not your board has this kind of hardware.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called rtc-cmos.

	depends on RTC_CLASS && I2C
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for various compatible RTC
	  chips (often with battery backup) connected with I2C.  This driver
	  should handle DS1307, DS1337, DS1338, DS1339, DS1340, ST M41T00,
	  and probably other chips.  In some cases the RTC must already
	  have been initialized (by manufacturing or a bootloader).

	  The first seven registers on these chips hold an RTC, and other
	  registers may add features such as NVRAM, a trickle charger for
	  the RTC/NVRAM backup power, and alarms.  This driver may not
	  expose all those available chip features.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
