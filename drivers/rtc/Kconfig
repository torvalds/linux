menuconfig RTC_CLASS
	bool "Real Time Clock"
	default n
	depends on !S390
	select RTC_LIB
	help
	  Generic RTC class support. If you say yes here, you will
 	  be allowed to plug one or more RTCs to your system. You will
	  probably want to enable one or more of the interfaces below.

config RTC_HCTOSYS
	bool "Set system time from RTC on startup and resume"
	depends on RTC_CLASS = y
	default y
	help
	  If you say yes here, the system time (wall clock) will be set using
	  the value read from a specified RTC device. This is useful to avoid
	  unnecessary fsck runs at boot time, and to network better.

config RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE
	string "RTC used to set the system time"
	depends on RTC_HCTOSYS = y
	default "rtc0"
	help
	  The RTC device that will be used to (re)initialize the system
	  clock, usually rtc0. Initialization is done when the system
	  starts up, and when it resumes from a low power state. This
	  device should record time in UTC, since the kernel won't do
	  timezone correction.

	  The driver for this RTC device must be loaded before late_initcall
	  functions run, so it must usually be statically linked.

	  This clock should be battery-backed, so that it reads the correct
	  time when the system boots from a power-off state. Otherwise, your
	  system will need an external clock source (like an NTP server).

	  If the clock you specify here is not battery backed, it may still
	  be useful to reinitialize system time when resuming from system
	  sleep states. Do not specify an RTC here unless it stays powered
	  during all this system's supported sleep states.

config RTC_DEBUG
	bool "RTC debug support"
	depends on RTC_CLASS = y
	help
	  Say yes here to enable debugging support in the RTC framework
	  and individual RTC drivers.

	  through that API.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config RTC_INTF_DEV
	boolean "/dev/rtcN (character devices)"
	default RTC_CLASS
	help
	  Say yes here if you want to use your RTCs using the /dev
	  interfaces, which "udev" sets up as /dev/rtc0 through
	  /dev/rtcN.

	  You may want to set up a symbolic link so one of these
	  can be accessed as /dev/rtc, which is a name
	  expected by "hwclock" and some other programs. Recent
	  versions of "udev" are known to set up the symlink for you.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config RTC_INTF_DEV_UIE_EMUL

	depends on RTC_INTF_DEV
	help
	  Provides an emulation for RTC_UIE if the underlying rtc chip
	  driver does not expose RTC_UIE ioctls. Those requests generate
	  once-per-second update interrupts, used for synchronization.

	  The emulation code will read the time from the hardware
	  clock several times per second, please enable this option
	  only if you know that you really need it.

config RTC_INTF_ALARM
	bool "Android alarm driver"
	depends on RTC_CLASS
	default y
	help
	  Provides non-wakeup and rtc backed wakeup alarms based on rtc or
	  elapsed realtime, and a non-wakeup alarm on the monotonic clock.
	  Also provides an interface to set the wall time which must be used
	  for elapsed realtime to work.

config RTC_INTF_ALARM_DEV

config RTC_DRV_TEST
	tristate "Test driver/device"
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the
	  RTC test driver. It's a software RTC which can be
	  used to test the RTC subsystem APIs. It gets
	  the time from the system clock.
	  You want this driver only if you are doing development
	  on the RTC subsystem. Please read the source code
