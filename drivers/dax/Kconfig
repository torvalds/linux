	  Support raw access to differentiated (persistence, bandwidth,
	  latency...) memory via an mmap(2) capable character
	  device.  Platform firmware or a device driver may identify a
	  platform memory resource that is differentiated from the
	  baseline memory pool.  Mappings of a /dev/daxX.Y device impose
	  restrictions that make the mapping behavior deterministic.
