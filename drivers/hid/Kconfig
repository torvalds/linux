	  A human interface device (HID) is a type of computer device that
	  interacts directly with and takes input from humans. The term "HID"
	  most commonly used to refer to the USB-HID specification, but other
	  devices (such as, but not strictly limited to, Bluetooth) are
	  designed using HID specification (this involves certain keyboards,
	  mice, tablets, etc). This option compiles into kernel the generic
	  HID layer code (parser, usages, etc.), which can then be used by
	  transport-specific HID implementation (like USB or Bluetooth).

	  For docs and specs, see http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/

	  If unsure, say Y

config HID_DEBUG
	bool "HID debugging support"
	default y if !EMBEDDED
	depends on HID
	---help---
	This option lets the HID layer output diagnostics about its internal
	state, resolve HID usages, dump HID fields, etc. Individual HID drivers
	use this debugging facility to output information about individual HID
	devices, etc.

	This feature is useful for those who are either debugging the HID parser
	or any HID hardware device.

	If unsure, say N
