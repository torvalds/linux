config HID
	tristate "Generic HID support"
	depends on INPUT
	default y
	---help---
	  A human interface device (HID) is a type of computer device that
	  interacts directly with and takes input from humans. The term "HID"
	  most commonly used to refer to the USB-HID specification, but other
	  devices (such as, but not strictly limited to, Bluetooth) are
	  designed using HID specification (this involves certain keyboards,
	  mice, tablets, etc). This option compiles into kernel the generic
	  HID layer code (parser, usages, etc.), which can then be used by
	  transport-specific HID implementation (like USB or Bluetooth).

	  For docs and specs, see http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/

	  If unsure, say Y.

config HID_DEBUG
	bool "HID debugging support"
	default y
	depends on HID
	---help---
	This option lets the HID layer output diagnostics about its internal
	state, resolve HID usages, dump HID fields, etc. Individual HID drivers
	use this debugging facility to output information about individual HID
	devices, etc.

	This feature is useful for those who are either debugging the HID parser
	or any HID hardware device.

	If unsure, say Y.

config HIDRAW
	bool "/dev/hidraw raw HID device support"
	depends on HID
	---help---
	Say Y here if you want to support HID devices (from the USB
	specification standpoint) that aren't strictly user interface
	devices, like monitor controls and Uninterruptable Power Supplies.

	This module supports these devices separately using a separate
	event interface on /dev/hidraw.

	There is also a /dev/hiddev configuration option in the USB HID
	configuration menu. In comparison to hiddev, this device does not process
	the hid events at all (no parsing, no lookups). This lets applications
	to work on raw hid events when they want to, and avoid using transport-specific
	userspace libhid/libusb libraries.

	If unsure, say Y.
