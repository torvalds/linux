config HID
	tristate "HID bus support"
	depends on INPUT
	default y
	---help---
	  A human interface device (HID) is a type of computer device that
	  interacts directly with and takes input from humans. The term "HID"
	  most commonly used to refer to the USB-HID specification, but other
	  devices (such as, but not strictly limited to, Bluetooth) are
	  designed using HID specification (this involves certain keyboards,
	  mice, tablets, etc). This option adds the HID bus to the kernel,
	  together with generic HID layer code. The HID devices are added and
	  removed from the HID bus by the transport-layer drivers, such as
	  usbhid (USB_HID) and hidp (BT_HIDP).

	  For docs and specs, see http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/

	  If unsure, say Y.

	This option adds support of reporting battery strength (for HID devices
	that support this feature) through power_supply class so that userspace
	tools, such as upower, can display it.

config HIDRAW
	bool "/dev/hidraw raw HID device support"
	depends on HID
	---help---
	Say Y here if you want to support HID devices (from the USB
	specification standpoint) that aren't strictly user interface
	devices, like monitor controls and Uninterruptable Power Supplies.

	This module supports these devices separately using a separate
	event interface on /dev/hidraw.

	There is also a /dev/hiddev configuration option in the USB HID
	configuration menu. In comparison to hiddev, this device does not process
	the hid events at all (no parsing, no lookups). This lets applications
	to work on raw hid events when they want to, and avoid using transport-specific
	userspace libhid/libusb libraries.

	If unsure, say Y.

config HID_GENERIC
	tristate "Generic HID driver"
	depends on HID
	default HID
	---help---
