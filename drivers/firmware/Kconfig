config ARM_PSCI_FW
	bool

config ARM_PSCI_CHECKER
	bool "ARM PSCI checker"
	depends on ARM_PSCI_FW && HOTPLUG_CPU && CPU_IDLE && !TORTURE_TEST
	help
	  Run the PSCI checker during startup. This checks that hotplug and
	  suspend operations work correctly when using PSCI.

	  The torture tests may interfere with the PSCI checker by turning CPUs
	  on and off through hotplug, so for now torture tests and PSCI checker
	  are mutually exclusive.

config ARM_SCMI_PROTOCOL
	bool "ARM System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) Message Protocol"
	depends on ARM || ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on MAILBOX
	help
	  ARM System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) protocol is a
	  set of operating system-independent software interfaces that are
	  used in system management. SCMI is extensible and currently provides
	  interfaces for: Discovery and self-description of the interfaces
	  it supports, Power domain management which is the ability to place
	  a given device or domain into the various power-saving states that
	  it supports, Performance management which is the ability to control
	  the performance of a domain that is composed of compute engines
	  such as application processors and other accelerators, Clock
	  management which is the ability to set and inquire rates on platform
	  managed clocks and Sensor management which is the ability to read
	  sensor data, and be notified of sensor value.

	  This protocol library provides interface for all the client drivers
	  making use of the features offered by the SCMI.

config ARM_SCMI_POWER_DOMAIN
	tristate "SCMI power domain driver"
	depends on ARM_SCMI_PROTOCOL || (COMPILE_TEST && OF)
	default y
	select PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS if PM
	help
	  This enables support for the SCMI power domains which can be
	  enabled or disabled via the SCP firmware

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called scmi_pm_domain. Note this may needed early in boot
	  before rootfs may be available.

config ARM_SCPI_PROTOCOL
	tristate "ARM System Control and Power Interface (SCPI) Message Protocol"
	depends on ARM || ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on MAILBOX
	help
	  System Control and Power Interface (SCPI) Message Protocol is
	  defined for the purpose of communication between the Application
	  Cores(AP) and the System Control Processor(SCP). The MHU peripheral
	  provides a mechanism for inter-processor communication between SCP
	  and AP.

	  SCP controls most of the power managament on the Application
	  Processors. It offers control and management of: the core/cluster
	  power states, various power domain DVFS including the core/cluster,
	  certain system clocks configuration, thermal sensors and many
	  others.

	  This protocol library provides interface for all the client drivers
	  making use of the features offered by the SCP.

	depends on ARM64
	help
	  The Software Delegated Exception Interface (SDEI) is an ARM
	  standard for registering callbacks from the platform firmware
	  into the OS. This is typically used to implement RAS notifications.

config EDD
	tristate "BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive calls determine boot disk"
	depends on X86
	help
	  Say Y or M here if you want to enable BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive
	  Services real mode BIOS calls to determine which disk
	  BIOS tries boot from.  This information is then exported via sysfs.

	  This option is experimental and is known to fail to boot on some
          obscure configurations. Most disk controller BIOS vendors do
          not yet implement this feature.

config EDD_OFF
	bool "Sets default behavior for EDD detection to off"
	depends on EDD
	default n
	help
	  Say Y if you want EDD disabled by default, even though it is compiled into the
	  kernel. Say N if you want EDD enabled by default. EDD can be dynamically set
	  using the kernel parameter 'edd={on|skipmbr|off}'.

config FIRMWARE_MEMMAP
    bool "Add firmware-provided memory map to sysfs" if EXPERT
    default X86
    help
      Add the firmware-provided (unmodified) memory map to /sys/firmware/memmap.
      That memory map is used for example by kexec to set up parameter area
      for the next kernel, but can also be used for debugging purposes.

      See also Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-firmware-memmap.

config EFI_PCDP
	bool "Console device selection via EFI PCDP or HCDP table"
	depends on ACPI && EFI && IA64
	default y if IA64
	help
	  If your firmware supplies the PCDP table, and you want to
	  automatically use the primary console device it describes
	  as the Linux console, say Y here.

	  If your firmware supplies the HCDP table, and you want to
	  use the first serial port it describes as the Linux console,
	  say Y here.  If your EFI ConOut path contains only a UART
	  device, it will become the console automatically.  Otherwise,
	  you must specify the "console=hcdp" kernel boot argument.

	  Neither the PCDP nor the HCDP affects naming of serial devices,
	  so a serial console may be /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, etc, depending
	  on how the driver discovers devices.

	  You must also enable the appropriate drivers (serial, VGA, etc.)

	  See DIG64_HCDPv20_042804.pdf available from
	  <http://www.dig64.org/specifications/>
