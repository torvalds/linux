config ARM_SCPI_PROTOCOL
	tristate "ARM System Control and Power Interface (SCPI) Message Protocol"
	depends on ARM || ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on MAILBOX
	help
	  System Control and Power Interface (SCPI) Message Protocol is
	  defined for the purpose of communication between the Application
	  Cores(AP) and the System Control Processor(SCP). The MHU peripheral
	  provides a mechanism for inter-processor communication between SCP
	  and AP.

	  SCP controls most of the power management on the Application
	  Processors. It offers control and management of: the core/cluster
	  power states, various power domain DVFS including the core/cluster,
	  certain system clocks configuration, thermal sensors and many
	  others.

	  This protocol library provides interface for all the client drivers
	  making use of the features offered by the SCP.

config ARM_SDE_INTERFACE
	bool "ARM Software Delegated Exception Interface (SDEI)"
	depends on ARM64
	help
	  The Software Delegated Exception Interface (SDEI) is an ARM
	  standard for registering callbacks from the platform firmware
	  into the OS. This is typically used to implement RAS notifications.

config EDD
	tristate "BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive calls determine boot disk"
	depends on X86
	help
	  Say Y or M here if you want to enable BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive
	  Services real mode BIOS calls to determine which disk
	  BIOS tries boot from.  This information is then exported via sysfs.

	  This option is experimental and is known to fail to boot on some
          obscure configurations. Most disk controller BIOS vendors do
          not yet implement this feature.

config EDD_OFF
	bool "Sets default behavior for EDD detection to off"
	depends on EDD
	default n
	help
	  Say Y if you want EDD disabled by default, even though it is compiled into the
	  kernel. Say N if you want EDD enabled by default. EDD can be dynamically set
	  using the kernel parameter 'edd={on|skipmbr|off}'.

config FIRMWARE_MEMMAP
    bool "Add firmware-provided memory map to sysfs" if EXPERT
    default X86
    help
      Add the firmware-provided (unmodified) memory map to /sys/firmware/memmap.
      That memory map is used for example by kexec to set up parameter area
      for the next kernel, but can also be used for debugging purposes.

      See also Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-firmware-memmap.

config DMIID
    bool "Export DMI identification via sysfs to userspace"
    depends on DMI
    default y
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to query SMBIOS/DMI system identification
	  information from userspace through /sys/class/dmi/id/ or if you want
	  DMI-based module auto-loading.

config DMI_SYSFS
	tristate "DMI table support in sysfs"
	depends on SYSFS && DMI
	default n
	help
	  Say Y or M here to enable the exporting of the raw DMI table
	  data via sysfs.  This is useful for consuming the data without
	  requiring any access to /dev/mem at all.  Tables are found
	  under /sys/firmware/dmi when this option is enabled and
	  loaded.

config DMI_SCAN_MACHINE_NON_EFI_FALLBACK
	bool

config ISCSI_IBFT_FIND
	bool "iSCSI Boot Firmware Table Attributes"
	depends on X86 && ISCSI_IBFT
	default n
	help
	  This option enables the kernel to find the region of memory
	  in which the ISCSI Boot Firmware Table (iBFT) resides. This
	  is necessary for iSCSI Boot Firmware Table Attributes module to work
	  properly.

config ISCSI_IBFT
	tristate "iSCSI Boot Firmware Table Attributes module"
	select ISCSI_BOOT_SYSFS
	select ISCSI_IBFT_FIND if X86
	depends on ACPI && SCSI && SCSI_LOWLEVEL
	default n
	help
	  This option enables support for detection and exposing of iSCSI
	  Boot Firmware Table (iBFT) via sysfs to userspace. If you wish to
	  detect iSCSI boot parameters dynamically during system boot, say Y.
	  Otherwise, say N.

config RASPBERRYPI_FIRMWARE
	tristate "Raspberry Pi Firmware Driver"
	depends on BCM2835_MBOX
	help
	  This option enables support for communicating with the firmware on the
	  Raspberry Pi.

config FW_CFG_SYSFS
	tristate "QEMU fw_cfg device support in sysfs"
	depends on SYSFS && (ARM || ARM64 || PARISC || PPC_PMAC || RISCV || SPARC || X86)
	depends on HAS_IOPORT_MAP
	default n
	help
	  Say Y or M here to enable the exporting of the QEMU firmware
	  configuration (fw_cfg) file entries via sysfs. Entries are
	  found under /sys/firmware/fw_cfg when this option is enabled
	  and loaded.

config FW_CFG_SYSFS_CMDLINE
	bool "QEMU fw_cfg device parameter parsing"
	depends on FW_CFG_SYSFS
	help
	  Allow the qemu_fw_cfg device to be initialized via the kernel
	  command line or using a module parameter.
	  WARNING: Using incorrect parameters (base address in particular)
	  may crash your system.

config INTEL_STRATIX10_SERVICE
	tristate "Intel Stratix10 Service Layer"
	depends on ARCH_INTEL_SOCFPGA && ARM64 && HAVE_ARM_SMCCC
	default n
	help
	  Intel Stratix10 service layer runs at privileged exception level,
	  interfaces with the service providers (FPGA manager is one of them)
	  and manages secure monitor call to communicate with secure monitor
	  software at secure monitor exception level.

	  Say Y here if you want Stratix10 service layer support.

config INTEL_STRATIX10_RSU
	tristate "Intel Stratix10 Remote System Update"
	depends on INTEL_STRATIX10_SERVICE
	help
	  The Intel Remote System Update (RSU) driver exposes interfaces
	  access through the Intel Service Layer to user space via sysfs
	  device attribute nodes. The RSU interfaces report/control some of
	  the optional RSU features of the Stratix 10 SoC FPGA.

	  The RSU provides a way for customers to update the boot
	  configuration of a Stratix 10 SoC device with significantly reduced
	  risk of corrupting the bitstream storage and bricking the system.

	  Enable RSU support if you are using an Intel SoC FPGA with the RSU
	  feature enabled and you want Linux user space control.

	  Say Y here if you want Intel RSU support.

config MTK_ADSP_IPC
	tristate "MTK ADSP IPC Protocol driver"
	depends on MTK_ADSP_MBOX
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek ADSP IPC
	  between host AP (Linux) and the firmware running on ADSP.
	  ADSP exists on some mtk processors.
	  Client might use shared memory to exchange information with ADSP.

config SYSFB
	bool
	select BOOT_VESA_SUPPORT
	select SCREEN_INFO

config SYSFB_SIMPLEFB
	bool "Mark VGA/VBE/EFI FB as generic system framebuffer"
	depends on X86 || EFI
	select SYSFB
	help
	  Firmwares often provide initial graphics framebuffers so the BIOS,
	  bootloader or kernel can show basic video-output during boot for
	  user-guidance and debugging. Historically, x86 used the VESA BIOS
	  Extensions and EFI-framebuffers for this, which are mostly limited
	  to x86 BIOS or EFI systems.
	  This option, if enabled, marks VGA/VBE/EFI framebuffers as generic
	  framebuffers so the new generic system-framebuffer drivers can be
	  used instead. If the framebuffer is not compatible with the generic
	  modes, it is advertised as fallback platform framebuffer so legacy
	  drivers like efifb, vesafb and uvesafb can pick it up.
	  If this option is not selected, all system framebuffers are always
	  marked as fallback platform framebuffers as usual.

	  Note: Legacy fbdev drivers, including vesafb, efifb, uvesafb, will
	  not be able to pick up generic system framebuffers if this option
	  is selected. You are highly encouraged to enable simplefb as
	  replacement if you select this option. simplefb can correctly deal
	  with generic system framebuffers. But you should still keep vesafb
	  and others enabled as fallback if a system framebuffer is
	  incompatible with simplefb.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config TH1520_AON_PROTOCOL
	tristate "Always-On firmware protocol"
	depends on ARCH_THEAD || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on MAILBOX
	help
	  Power, clock, and resource management capabilities on the TH1520 SoC are
	  managed by the E902 core. Firmware running on this core communicates with
	  the kernel through the Always-On protocol, using hardware mailbox as a medium.
	  Say yes if you need such capabilities.

config TI_SCI_PROTOCOL
	tristate "TI System Control Interface (TISCI) Message Protocol"
	depends on TI_MESSAGE_MANAGER
	default ARCH_K3
	help
	  TI System Control Interface (TISCI) Message Protocol is used to manage
	  compute systems such as ARM, DSP etc with the system controller in
	  complex System on Chip(SoC) such as those found on certain keystone
	  generation SoC from TI.

	  System controller provides various facilities including power
	  management function support.

	  This protocol library is used by client drivers to use the features
	  provided by the system controller.

config TRUSTED_FOUNDATIONS
	bool "Trusted Foundations secure monitor support"
	depends on ARM && CPU_V7
	help
	  Some devices (including most early Tegra-based consumer devices on
	  the market) are booted with the Trusted Foundations secure monitor
	  active, requiring some core operations to be performed by the secure
	  monitor instead of the kernel.

	  This option allows the kernel to invoke the secure monitor whenever
	  required on devices using Trusted Foundations. See the functions and
	  comments in linux/firmware/trusted_foundations.h or the device tree
	  bindings for "tlm,trusted-foundations" for details on how to use it.

	  Choose N if you don't know what this is about.

config TURRIS_MOX_RWTM
	tristate "Turris Mox rWTM secure firmware driver"
	depends on ARCH_MVEBU || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on HAS_DMA && OF
	depends on MAILBOX
	select HW_RANDOM
	select ARMADA_37XX_RWTM_MBOX
	help
	  This driver communicates with the firmware on the Cortex-M3 secure
	  processor of the Turris Mox router. Enable if you are building for
	  Turris Mox, and you will be able to read the device serial number and
	  other manufacturing data and also utilize the Entropy Bit Generator
	  for hardware random number generation.

if TURRIS_MOX_RWTM

config TURRIS_MOX_RWTM_KEYCTL
	bool "Turris Mox rWTM ECDSA message signing"
	default y
	depends on KEYS
	depends on ASYMMETRIC_KEY_TYPE
	select CZNIC_PLATFORMS
	select TURRIS_SIGNING_KEY
	help
	  Say Y here to add support for ECDSA message signing with board private
	  key (each Turris Mox has an ECDSA private key generated in the secure
	  coprocessor when manufactured). This functionality is exposed via the
	  keyctl() syscall.
