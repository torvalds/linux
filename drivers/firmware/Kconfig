config EDD
	tristate "BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive calls determine boot disk"
	depends on !IA64
	help
	  Say Y or M here if you want to enable BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive
	  Services real mode BIOS calls to determine which disk
	  BIOS tries boot from.  This information is then exported via sysfs.

	  This option is experimental and is known to fail to boot on some
          obscure configurations. Most disk controller BIOS vendors do
          not yet implement this feature.

config EFI_VARS
	tristate "EFI Variable Support via sysfs"
	depends on EFI
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, you are able to get EFI (Extensible Firmware
	  Interface) variable information via sysfs.  You may read,
	  write, create, and destroy EFI variables through this interface.

	  Note that using this driver in concert with efibootmgr requires
	  at least test release version 0.5.0-test3 or later, which is
	  available from Matt Domsch's website located at:
	  <http://linux.dell.com/efibootmgr/testing/efibootmgr-0.5.0-test3.tar.gz>

	  Subsequent efibootmgr releases may be found at:
	  <http://linux.dell.com/efibootmgr>

config EFI_PCDP
	bool "Console device selection via EFI PCDP or HCDP table"
	depends on ACPI && EFI && IA64
	default y if IA64
	help
	  If your firmware supplies the PCDP table, and you want to
	  automatically use the primary console device it describes
	  as the Linux console, say Y here.

	  If your firmware supplies the HCDP table, and you want to
	  use the first serial port it describes as the Linux console,
	  say Y here.  If your EFI ConOut path contains only a UART
	  device, it will become the console automatically.  Otherwise,
	  you must specify the "console=hcdp" kernel boot argument.

	  Neither the PCDP nor the HCDP affects naming of serial devices,
	  so a serial console may be /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, etc, depending
	  on how the driver discovers devices.

	  You must also enable the appropriate drivers (serial, VGA, etc.)

	  See <http://www.dig64.org/specifications/DIG64_HCDPv20_042804.pdf>

config DELL_RBU
	tristate "BIOS update support for DELL systems via sysfs"
	depends on X86
	select FW_LOADER
	help
	 Say m if you want to have the option of updating the BIOS for your
	 DELL system. Note you need a Dell OpenManage or Dell Update package (DUP)
	 supporting application to communicate with the BIOS regarding the new
	 image for the image update to take effect.
	 See <file:Documentation/dell_rbu.txt> for more details on the driver.

config DCDBAS
	tristate "Dell Systems Management Base Driver"
	depends on X86
	help
	  The Dell Systems Management Base Driver provides a sysfs interface
	  for systems management software to perform System Management
	  Interrupts (SMIs) and Host Control Actions (system power cycle or
	  power off after OS shutdown) on certain Dell systems.

	  See <file:Documentation/dcdbas.txt> for more details on the driver
	  and the Dell systems on which Dell systems management software makes
	  use of this driver.

	  Say Y or M here to enable the driver for use by Dell systems
	  management software such as Dell OpenManage.

config DMIID
    bool "Export DMI identification via sysfs to userspace"
    depends on DMI
    default y
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to query SMBIOS/DMI system identification
	  information from userspace through /sys/class/dmi/id/ or if you want
	  DMI-based module auto-loading.

config ISCSI_IBFT_FIND
	bool "iSCSI Boot Firmware Table Attributes"
	depends on X86
	default n
	help
	  This option enables the kernel to find the region of memory
	  in which the ISCSI Boot Firmware Table (iBFT) resides. This
	  is necessary for iSCSI Boot Firmware Table Attributes module to work
	  properly.

config ISCSI_IBFT
	tristate "iSCSI Boot Firmware Table Attributes module"
	depends on ISCSI_IBFT_FIND
	default	n
	help
	  This option enables support for detection and exposing of iSCSI
	  Boot Firmware Table (iBFT) via sysfs to userspace. If you wish to
	  detect iSCSI boot parameters dynamically during system boot, say Y.
	  Otherwise, say N.
