	  Broadcom home routers contain flash partition called "nvram" with all
	  important hardware configuration as well as some minor user setup.
	  NVRAM partition contains a text-like data representing name=value
	  pairs.
	  This driver provides an easy way to get value of requested parameter.
	  It simply reads content of NVRAM and parses it. It doesn't control any
	  hardware part itself.

	  Broadcom devices store configuration data in SPROM. Accessing it is
	  specific to the bus host type, e.g. PCI(e) devices have it mapped in
	  a PCI BAR.
	  In case of SoC devices SPROM content is stored on a flash used by
	  bootloader firmware CFE. This driver provides method to ssb and bcma
	  drivers to read SPROM on SoC.
