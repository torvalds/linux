	  This enables DSP IPC protocol between host AP (Linux)
	  and the firmware running on DSP.
	  DSP exists on some i.MX8 processors (e.g i.MX8QM, i.MX8QXP).

	  It acts like a doorbell. Client might use shared memory to
	  exchange information with DSP side.

	  The System Controller Firmware (SCFW) is a low-level system function
	  which runs on a dedicated Cortex-M core to provide power, clock, and
	  resource management. It exists on some i.MX8 processors. e.g. i.MX8QM
	  (QM, QP), and i.MX8QX (QXP, DX).

	  This driver manages the IPC interface between host CPU and the
	  SCU firmware running on M4.

	  The System Controller Management Interface firmware (SCMI FW) is
	  a low-level system function which runs on a dedicated Cortex-M
	  core that could provide misc functions such as board control.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.
