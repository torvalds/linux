	  IVC (Inter-VM Communication) protocol is part of the IPC
	  (Inter Processor Communication) framework on Tegra. It maintains the
	  data and the different communication channels in SysRAM or RAM and
	  keeps the content is synchronization between host CPU and remote
	  processors.

	  BPMP (Boot and Power Management Processor) is designed to off-loading
	  the PM functions which include clock/DVFS/thermal/power from the CPU.
	  It needs HSP as the HW synchronization and notification module and
	  IVC module as the message communication protocol.

	  This driver manages the IPC interface between host CPU and the
	  firmware running on BPMP.
