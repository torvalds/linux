config EFI_VARS
	tristate "EFI Variable Support via sysfs"
	depends on EFI && (X86 || IA64)
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, you are able to get EFI (Extensible Firmware
	  Interface) variable information via sysfs.  You may read,
	  write, create, and destroy EFI variables through this interface.
	  Note that this driver is only retained for compatibility with
	  legacy users: new users should use the efivarfs filesystem
	  instead.

config EFI_ESRT

	default y

config EFI_VARS_PSTORE
	tristate "Register efivars backend for pstore"
	depends on PSTORE
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to enable use efivars as a backend to pstore. This
	  will allow writing console messages, crash dumps, or anything
	  else supported by pstore to EFI variables.

config EFI_VARS_PSTORE_DEFAULT_DISABLE
	bool "Disable using efivars as a pstore backend by default"
	depends on EFI_VARS_PSTORE
	default n
	help
	  Saying Y here will disable the use of efivars as a storage
	  backend for pstore by default. This setting can be overridden
	  using the efivars module's pstore_disable parameter.

config EFI_RUNTIME_MAP
	bool "Export efi runtime maps to sysfs"
	depends on X86 && EFI && KEXEC_CORE
	default y
	help
	  Export efi runtime memory maps to /sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map.
	  That memory map is used for example by kexec to set up efi virtual
	  mapping the 2nd kernel, but can also be used for debugging purposes.

	  See also Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-firmware-efi-runtime-map.

config EFI_FAKE_MEMMAP
	bool "Enable EFI fake memory map"
	depends on EFI && X86
	default n
	help
	  Saying Y here will enable "efi_fake_mem" boot option.
	  By specifying this parameter, you can add arbitrary attribute
	  to specific memory range by updating original (firmware provided)
	  EFI memmap.
	  This is useful for debugging of EFI memmap related feature.
	  e.g. Address Range Mirroring feature.

config EFI_MAX_FAKE_MEM
	int "maximum allowable number of ranges in efi_fake_mem boot option"
	depends on EFI_FAKE_MEMMAP
	range 1 128
	default 8
	help
	  Maximum allowable number of ranges in efi_fake_mem boot option.
	  Ranges can be set up to this value using comma-separated list.
	  The default value is 8.

config EFI_SOFT_RESERVE
	bool "Reserve EFI Specific Purpose Memory"
	depends on EFI && EFI_STUB && ACPI_HMAT
	default ACPI_HMAT
	help
	  On systems that have mixed performance classes of memory EFI
	  may indicate specific purpose memory with an attribute (See
	  EFI_MEMORY_SP in UEFI 2.8). A memory range tagged with this
	  attribute may have unique performance characteristics compared
	  to the system's general purpose "System RAM" pool. On the
	  expectation that such memory has application specific usage,
	  and its base EFI memory type is "conventional" answer Y to
	  arrange for the kernel to reserve it as a "Soft Reserved"
	  resource, and set aside for direct-access (device-dax) by
	  default. The memory range can later be optionally assigned to
	  the page allocator by system administrator policy via the
	  device-dax kmem facility. Say N to have the kernel treat this
	  memory as "System RAM" by default.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config EFI_PARAMS_FROM_FDT
	bool
	help
	  Select this config option from the architecture Kconfig if
	  the EFI runtime support gets system table address, memory
          map address, and other parameters from the device tree.

config EFI_ARMSTUB_DTB_LOADER
	bool "Enable the DTB loader"
	depends on EFI_GENERIC_STUB && !RISCV
	default y
	help
	  Select this config option to add support for the dtb= command
	  line parameter, allowing a device tree blob to be loaded into
	  memory from the EFI System Partition by the stub.

	  If the device tree is provided by the platform or by
	  the bootloader this option may not be needed.
	  But, for various development reasons and to maintain existing
	  functionality for bootloaders that do not have such support
	  this option is necessary.

config EFI_GENERIC_STUB_INITRD_CMDLINE_LOADER
	bool "Enable the command line initrd loader" if !X86
	depends on EFI_STUB && (EFI_GENERIC_STUB || X86)
	default y if X86
	depends on !RISCV
	help
	  Select this config option to add support for the initrd= command
	  line parameter, allowing an initrd that resides on the same volume
	  as the kernel image to be loaded into memory.

	  This method is deprecated.

config EFI_BOOTLOADER_CONTROL
	tristate "EFI Bootloader Control"
	default n
	help
	  This module installs a reboot hook, such that if reboot() is
	  invoked with a string argument NNN, "NNN" is copied to the
	  "LoaderEntryOneShot" EFI variable, to be read by the
	  bootloader. If the string matches one of the boot labels
	  defined in its configuration, the bootloader will boot once
	  to that label. The "LoaderEntryRebootReason" EFI variable is
	  set with the reboot reason: "reboot" or "shutdown". The
	  bootloader reads this reboot reason and takes particular
	  action according to its policy.

config EFI_CAPSULE_LOADER
	tristate "EFI capsule loader"
	depends on EFI && !IA64
	help
	  This option exposes a loader interface "/dev/efi_capsule_loader" for
	  users to load EFI capsules. This driver requires working runtime
	  capsule support in the firmware, which many OEMs do not provide.

	  Most users should say N.

config EFI_CAPSULE_QUIRK_QUARK_CSH
	bool "Add support for Quark capsules with non-standard headers"
	depends on X86 && !64BIT
	select EFI_CAPSULE_LOADER
	default y
	help
	  Add support for processing Quark X1000 EFI capsules, whose header
	  layout deviates from the layout mandated by the UEFI specification.

config EFI_TEST
	tristate "EFI Runtime Service Tests Support"
	depends on EFI
	default n
	help
	  This driver uses the efi.<service> function pointers directly instead
	  of going through the efivar API, because it is not trying to test the
	  kernel subsystem, just for testing the UEFI runtime service
	  interfaces which are provided by the firmware. This driver is used
	  by the Firmware Test Suite (FWTS) for testing the UEFI runtime
	  interfaces readiness of the firmware.
	  Details for FWTS are available from:
	  <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirmwareTestSuite>

	  Say Y here to enable the runtime services support via /dev/efi_test.
	  If unsure, say N.

config APPLE_PROPERTIES
	bool "Apple Device Properties"
	depends on EFI_STUB && X86
	select EFI_DEV_PATH_PARSER
	select UCS2_STRING
	help
	  Retrieve properties from EFI on Apple Macs and assign them to
	  devices, allowing for improved support of Apple hardware.
	  Properties that would otherwise be missing include the
	  Thunderbolt Device ROM and GPU configuration data.

	  If unsure, say Y if you have a Mac.  Otherwise N.

config RESET_ATTACK_MITIGATION
	bool "Reset memory attack mitigation"
	depends on EFI_STUB
	help
	  Request that the firmware clear the contents of RAM after a reboot
	  using the TCG Platform Reset Attack Mitigation specification. This
	  protects against an attacker forcibly rebooting the system while it
	  still contains secrets in RAM, booting another OS and extracting the
	  secrets. This should only be enabled when userland is configured to
	  clear the MemoryOverwriteRequest flag on clean shutdown after secrets
	  have been evicted, since otherwise it will trigger even on clean
	  reboots.

config EFI_RCI2_TABLE
	bool "EFI Runtime Configuration Interface Table Version 2 Support"
	depends on X86 || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  Displays the content of the Runtime Configuration Interface
	  Table version 2 on Dell EMC PowerEdge systems as a binary
	  attribute 'rci2' under /sys/firmware/efi/tables directory.

	  RCI2 table contains BIOS HII in XML format and is used to populate
	  BIOS setup page in Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator tool.
	  The BIOS setup page contains BIOS tokens which can be configured.

	  Say Y here for Dell EMC PowerEdge systems.

config EFI_DISABLE_PCI_DMA
       bool "Clear Busmaster bit on PCI bridges during ExitBootServices()"
       help
	  Disable the busmaster bit in the control register on all PCI bridges
	  while calling ExitBootServices() and passing control to the runtime
	  kernel. System firmware may configure the IOMMU to prevent malicious
	  PCI devices from being able to attack the OS via DMA. However, since
	  firmware can't guarantee that the OS is IOMMU-aware, it will tear
	  down IOMMU configuration when ExitBootServices() is called. This
	  leaves a window between where a hostile device could still cause
	  damage before Linux configures the IOMMU again.

	  If you say Y here, the EFI stub will clear the busmaster bit on all
	  PCI bridges before ExitBootServices() is called. This will prevent
	  any malicious PCI devices from being able to perform DMA until the
	  kernel reenables busmastering after configuring the IOMMU.

	  This option will cause failures with some poorly behaved hardware
	  and should not be enabled without testing. The kernel commandline
	  options "efi=disable_early_pci_dma" or "efi=no_disable_early_pci_dma"
	  may be used to override this option.

config EFI_DISABLE_RUNTIME
	bool "Disable EFI runtime services support by default"
	default y if PREEMPT_RT
	help
	  Allow to disable the EFI runtime services support by default. This can
	  already be achieved by using the efi=noruntime option, but it could be
	  useful to have this default without any kernel command line parameter.

	  The EFI runtime services are disabled by default when PREEMPT_RT is
	  enabled, because measurements have shown that some EFI functions calls
	  might take too much time to complete, causing large latencies which is
	  an issue for Real-Time kernels.

	  This default can be overridden by using the efi=runtime option.
