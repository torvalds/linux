config EFI_VARS
	tristate "EFI Variable Support via sysfs"
	depends on EFI
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, you are able to get EFI (Extensible Firmware
	  Interface) variable information via sysfs.  You may read,
	  write, create, and destroy EFI variables through this interface.

	  Note that using this driver in concert with efibootmgr requires
	  at least test release version 0.5.0-test3 or later, which is
	  available from:
	  <http://linux.dell.com/efibootmgr/testing/efibootmgr-0.5.0-test3.tar.gz>

	  Subsequent efibootmgr releases may be found at:

config EFI_VARS_PSTORE
	tristate "Register efivars backend for pstore"
	depends on EFI_VARS && PSTORE
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to enable use efivars as a backend to pstore. This
	  will allow writing console messages, crash dumps, or anything
	  else supported by pstore to EFI variables.

config EFI_VARS_PSTORE_DEFAULT_DISABLE
	bool "Disable using efivars as a pstore backend by default"
	depends on EFI_VARS_PSTORE
	default n
	help
	  Saying Y here will disable the use of efivars as a storage
	  backend for pstore by default. This setting can be overridden
	  using the efivars module's pstore_disable parameter.

config EFI_RUNTIME_MAP
	bool "Export efi runtime maps to sysfs"
	depends on X86 && EFI && KEXEC_CORE
	default y
	help
	  Export efi runtime memory maps to /sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map.
	  That memory map is used for example by kexec to set up efi virtual
	  mapping the 2nd kernel, but can also be used for debugging purposes.

	  See also Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-firmware-efi-runtime-map.

config EFI_FAKE_MEMMAP
	bool "Enable EFI fake memory map"
	depends on EFI && X86
	default n
	help
	  Saying Y here will enable "efi_fake_mem" boot option.
	  By specifying this parameter, you can add arbitrary attribute
	  to specific memory range by updating original (firmware provided)
	  EFI memmap.
	  This is useful for debugging of EFI memmap related feature.
	  e.g. Address Range Mirroring feature.

config EFI_MAX_FAKE_MEM
	int "maximum allowable number of ranges in efi_fake_mem boot option"
	depends on EFI_FAKE_MEMMAP
	range 1 128
	default 8
	help
	  Maximum allowable number of ranges in efi_fake_mem boot option.
	  Ranges can be set up to this value using comma-separated list.
	  The default value is 8.

config EFI_PARAMS_FROM_FDT
	bool
	help
	  Select this config option from the architecture Kconfig if
	  the EFI runtime support gets system table address, memory
          map address, and other parameters from the device tree.

config EFI_BOOTLOADER_CONTROL
	tristate "EFI Bootloader Control"
	depends on EFI_VARS
	default n
	---help---
	  This module installs a reboot hook, such that if reboot() is
	  invoked with a string argument NNN, "NNN" is copied to the
	  "LoaderEntryOneShot" EFI variable, to be read by the
	  bootloader. If the string matches one of the boot labels
	  defined in its configuration, the bootloader will boot once
	  to that label. The "LoaderEntryRebootReason" EFI variable is
	  set with the reboot reason: "reboot" or "shutdown". The
	  bootloader reads this reboot reason and takes particular
	  action according to its policy.

config EFI_CAPSULE_LOADER
	tristate "EFI capsule loader"
	depends on EFI
	help
	  This option exposes a loader interface "/dev/efi_capsule_loader" for
	  users to load EFI capsules. This driver requires working runtime
	  capsule support in the firmware, which many OEMs do not provide.

	  Most users should say N.

config EFI_CAPSULE_QUIRK_QUARK_CSH
	bool "Add support for Quark capsules with non-standard headers"
	depends on X86 && !64BIT
	select EFI_CAPSULE_LOADER
	default y
	help
	  Add support for processing Quark X1000 EFI capsules, whose header
	  layout deviates from the layout mandated by the UEFI specification.

config EFI_TEST
	tristate "EFI Runtime Service Tests Support"
	depends on EFI
	default n
	help
	  This driver uses the efi.<service> function pointers directly instead
	  of going through the efivar API, because it is not trying to test the
	  kernel subsystem, just for testing the UEFI runtime service
	  interfaces which are provided by the firmware. This driver is used
	  by the Firmware Test Suite (FWTS) for testing the UEFI runtime
	  interfaces readiness of the firmware.
	  Details for FWTS are available from:
	  <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirmwareTestSuite>

	  Say Y here to enable the runtime services support via /dev/efi_test.
	  If unsure, say N.

config APPLE_PROPERTIES
	bool "Apple Device Properties"
	depends on EFI_STUB && X86
	select EFI_DEV_PATH_PARSER
	select UCS2_STRING
	help
	  Retrieve properties from EFI on Apple Macs and assign them to
	  devices, allowing for improved support of Apple hardware.
	  Properties that would otherwise be missing include the
	  Thunderbolt Device ROM and GPU configuration data.

	  If unsure, say Y if you have a Mac.  Otherwise N.

config RESET_ATTACK_MITIGATION
	bool "Reset memory attack mitigation"
	depends on EFI_STUB
	help
	  Request that the firmware clear the contents of RAM after a reboot
	  using the TCG Platform Reset Attack Mitigation specification. This
	  protects against an attacker forcibly rebooting the system while it
	  still contains secrets in RAM, booting another OS and extracting the
	  secrets. This should only be enabled when userland is configured to
	  clear the MemoryOverwriteRequest flag on clean shutdown after secrets
	  have been evicted, since otherwise it will trigger even on clean
	  reboots.
