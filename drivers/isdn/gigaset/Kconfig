	  This driver supports the Siemens Gigaset SX205/255 family of
	  ISDN DECT bases, including the predecessors Gigaset 3070/3075
	  and 4170/4175 and their T-Com versions Sinus 45isdn and Sinus
	  721X.
	  If you have one of these devices, say M here and for at least
	  one of the connection specific parts that follow.
	  This will build a module called "gigaset".
