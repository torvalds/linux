	depends on ISA
	help
	  This enables support for two kinds of ISDN-cards made by a German
	  company called ICN.  2B is the standard version for a single ISDN
	  line with two B-channels, 4B supports two ISDN lines.  For running
	  this card, additional firmware is necessary, which has to be
	  downloaded into the card using a utility which is distributed
	  separately.  See <file:Documentation/isdn/README> and
	  <file:Documentation/isdn/README.icn> for more
	  information.
