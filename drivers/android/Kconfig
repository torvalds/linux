	---help---
	  Binder is used in Android for both communication between processes,
	  and remote method invocation.

	  This means one Android process can call a method/routine in another
	  Android process, using Binder to identify, invoke and pass arguments
	  between said processes.

config ANDROID_BINDER_DEVICES
	string "Android Binder devices"
	depends on ANDROID_BINDER_IPC
	default "binder,hwbinder"
	---help---
	  Default value for the binder.devices parameter.

	  The binder.devices parameter is a comma-separated list of strings
	  that specifies the names of the binder device nodes that will be
	  created. Each binder device has its own context manager, and is
	  therefore logically separated from the other devices.

config ANDROID_BINDER_IPC_32BIT
	bool
	depends on !64BIT && ANDROID_BINDER_IPC
	default y
	---help---
	  The Binder API has been changed to support both 32 and 64bit
	  applications in a mixed environment.

	  Enable this to support an old 32-bit Android user-space (v4.4 and
	  earlier).

	  Note that enabling this will break newer Android user-space.
