	help
	  Enable this to support the High-Speed USB transceivers that are part
	  of some STMicroelectronics STM32 SoCs.

	  This driver controls the entire USB PHY block: the USB PHY controller
	  (USBPHYC) and the two 8-bit wide UTMI+ interfaces. First interface is
	  used by an HS USB Host controller, and the second one is shared
	  between an HS USB OTG controller and an HS USB Host controller,
	  selected by a USB switch.
