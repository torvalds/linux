	  Generic PHY support.

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface for PHY
	  devices present in the kernel. This layer will have the generic
	  API by which phy drivers can create PHY using the phy framework and
	  phy users can obtain reference to the PHY. All the users of this
	  framework should select this config.
