	  This can be used to test the driver in a simulated environment

	help
	  Select this option to enable additional checking and reporting on the
	  use of sync fences in the Mali driver.

	  This will add a 3s timeout to all sync fence waits in the Mali
	  driver, so that when work for Mali has been waiting on a sync fence
	  for a long time a debug message will be printed, detailing what fence
	  is causing the block, and which dependent Mali atoms are blocked as a
	  result of this.

	  The timeout can be changed at runtime through the js_soft_timeout

	  This feature is unsupported and unstable, and may break at any time.
	  Enabling this option will prevent power management from working
	  optimally and may cause instrumentation tools to return bogus results.

	  No validation is done on the debugfs input. Invalid input could cause
