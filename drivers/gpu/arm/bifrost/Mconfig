menuconfig MALI_BIFROST
	bool "Mali Midgard series support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this option to build support for a ARM Mali Midgard GPU.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  this will generate a single module, called mali_kbase.

config MALI_PLATFORM_NAME

	string "Platform name"
	default "hisilicon" if PLATFORM_HIKEY960
	default "hisilicon" if PLATFORM_HIKEY970
	default "devicetree"
	help
	  Enter the name of the desired platform configuration directory to
	  include in the build. 'platform/$(MALI_PLATFORM_NAME)/Kbuild' must
	  exist.

	  When PLATFORM_CUSTOM is set, this needs to be set manually to
	  pick up the desired platform files.

	  Enables support for CSF based GPUs.

config MALI_BIFROST_DEVFREQ
	bool "Enable devfreq support for Mali"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST
	default y
	help
	  Support devfreq for Mali.

	  Using the devfreq framework and, by default, the simple on-demand
	  governor, the frequency of Mali will be dynamically selected from the
	  available OPPs.

config MALI_BIFROST_DVFS
	bool "Enable legacy DVFS"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && !MALI_BIFROST_DEVFREQ
	default n

	  Choose this option to enable legacy DVFS in the Mali Midgard DDK.

config MALI_BIFROST_GATOR_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable Streamline tracing support"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && !BACKEND_USER
	default y
	help
	  Enables kbase tracing used by the Arm Streamline Performance Analyzer.
	  The tracepoints are used to derive GPU activity charts in Streamline.

config MALI_BIFROST_ENABLE_TRACE
	bool "Enable kbase tracing"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST
	default y if MALI_BIFROST_DEBUG
	default n
	help
	  Enables tracing in kbase. Trace log available through
	  the "mali_trace" debugfs file, when the CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is enabled

config MALI_BIFROST_DMA_FENCE
	bool "Enable DMA_BUF fence support for Mali"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST
	default n
	help
	  Support DMA_BUF fences for Mali.

	  This option should only be enabled if the Linux Kernel has built in
	  support for DMA_BUF fences.

config MALI_ARBITER_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable arbiter support for Mali"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && !MALI_CSF_SUPPORT
	default n
	help
	  Enable support for the arbiter interface in the driver.
	  This allows an external arbiter to manage driver access
	  to GPU hardware in a virtualized environment

	  If unsure, say N.

config DMA_BUF_SYNC_IOCTL_SUPPORTED
	bool "Enable Kernel DMA buffers support DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC"

	bool "Enable map imported dma-bufs on demand"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST
	default n
	default y if !DMA_BUF_SYNC_IOCTL_SUPPORTED
	help
	  This option caused kbase to set up the GPU mapping of imported
	  dma-buf when needed to run atoms. This is the legacy behavior.

	  This is intended for testing and the option will get removed in the
	  future.

config MALI_DMA_BUF_LEGACY_COMPAT
	bool "Enable legacy compatibility cache flush on dma-buf map"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && !MALI_DMA_BUF_MAP_ON_DEMAND
	default n

	  This option enables compatibility with legacy dma-buf mapping
	  behavior, then the dma-buf is mapped on import, by adding cache
	  maintenance where MALI_DMA_BUF_MAP_ON_DEMAND would do the mapping,
	  including a cache flush.

	  This option might work-around issues related to missing cache
	  flushes in other drivers. This only has an effect for clients using
	  UK 11.18 or older. For later UK versions it is not possible.

menuconfig MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT
	depends on MALI_BIFROST
	bool "Enable Expert Settings"
	default y
	help
	  Enabling this option and modifying the default settings may produce
	  a driver with performance or other limitations.

config MALI_2MB_ALLOC
	bool "Attempt to allocate 2MB pages"

	default n
	help
	  Rather than allocating all GPU memory page-by-page, attempt to
	  allocate 2MB pages from the kernel. This reduces TLB pressure and
	  helps to prevent memory fragmentation.

	  If in doubt, say N

config MALI_MEMORY_FULLY_BACKED
	bool "Enable memory fully physically-backed"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	  This option enables full physical backing of all virtual
	  memory allocations in the kernel. Notice that this build
	  option only affects allocations of grow-on-GPU-page-fault
	  memory.

config MALI_CORESTACK
	bool "Enable support of GPU core stack power control"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this feature on supported GPUs will let the driver powering
	  on/off the GPU core stack independently without involving the Power
	  Domain Controller. This should only be enabled on platforms which
	  integration of the PDC to the Mali GPU is known to be problematic.
	  This feature is currently only supported on t-Six and t-HEx GPUs.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MALI_FW_CORE_DUMP
	bool "Enable support for FW core dump"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT && MALI_CSF_SUPPORT
	default n
	help
	  Adds ability to request firmware core dump

	  Example:
	  * To explicitly request core dump:
		echo 1 >/sys/kernel/debug/mali0/fw_core_dump
	  * To output current core dump (after explicitly requesting a core dump,
	    or kernel driver reported an internal firmware error):
                cat /sys/kernel/debug/mali0/fw_core_dump

	default y if MALI_BIFROST_DEBUG
	help
	  Select this option to enable additional checking and reporting on the
	  use of sync fences in the Mali driver.

	  This will add a 3s timeout to all sync fence waits in the Mali
	  driver, so that when work for Mali has been waiting on a sync fence
	  for a long time a debug message will be printed, detailing what fence
	  is causing the block, and which dependent Mali atoms are blocked as a
	  result of this.

	  The timeout can be changed at runtime through the js_soft_timeout
	  device attribute, where the timeout is specified in milliseconds.

	  PWRSOFT-765 fixes devfreq cooling devices issues. The fix was merged
