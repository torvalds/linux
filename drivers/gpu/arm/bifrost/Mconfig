menuconfig MALI_BIFROST
	bool "Mali Midgard series support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this option to build support for a ARM Mali Midgard GPU.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  this will generate a single module, called mali_kbase.

config MALI_BIFROST_GATOR_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable Streamline tracing support"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && !BACKEND_USER
	default y
	help
	  Enables kbase tracing used by the Arm Streamline Performance Analyzer.
	  The tracepoints are used to derive GPU activity charts in Streamline.

config MALI_BIFROST_DVFS
	bool "Enable legacy DVFS"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && !MALI_BIFROST_DEVFREQ
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to enable legacy DVFS in the Mali Midgard DDK.

config MALI_BIFROST_ENABLE_TRACE
	bool "Enable kbase tracing"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST
	default n
	help
	  Enables tracing in kbase.  Trace log available through
	  the "mali_trace" debugfs file, when the CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is enabled

config MALI_BIFROST_DEVFREQ
	bool "devfreq support for Mali"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST
	default y if PLATFORM_JUNO
	default y if PLATFORM_CUSTOM
	help
	  Support devfreq for Mali.

	  Using the devfreq framework and, by default, the simpleondemand
	  governor, the frequency of Mali will be dynamically selected from the
	  available OPPs.

config MALI_BIFROST_DMA_FENCE
	bool "DMA_BUF fence support for Mali"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST
	default n
	help
	  Support DMA_BUF fences for Mali.

	  This option should only be enabled if the Linux Kernel has built in
	  support for DMA_BUF fences.

config MALI_PLATFORM_NAME
	depends on MALI_BIFROST
	string "Platform name"
	default "hisilicon" if PLATFORM_HIKEY960
	default "hisilicon" if PLATFORM_HIKEY970
	default "devicetree"
	help
	  Enter the name of the desired platform configuration directory to
	  include in the build. 'platform/$(MALI_PLATFORM_NAME)/Kbuild' must
	  exist.

	  When PLATFORM_CUSTOM is set, this needs to be set manually to
	  pick up the desired platform files.

# MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT configuration options

menuconfig MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT
	depends on MALI_BIFROST
	bool "Enable Expert Settings"
	default y
	help
	  Enabling this option and modifying the default settings may produce a driver with performance or
	  other limitations.

config MALI_CORESTACK
	bool "Support controlling power to the GPU core stack"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this feature on supported GPUs will let the driver powering
	  on/off the GPU core stack independently without involving the Power
	  Domain Controller. This should only be enabled on platforms which
	  integration of the PDC to the Mali GPU is known to be problematic.
	  This feature is currently only supported on t-Six and t-HEx GPUs.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MALI_BIFROST_DEBUG
	bool "Debug build"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT
	default y if DEBUG
	default n
	help
	  Select this option for increased checking and reporting of errors.

config MALI_BIFROST_FENCE_DEBUG
	bool "Debug sync fence usage"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT
	default y if MALI_BIFROST_DEBUG
	help
	  Select this option to enable additional checking and reporting on the
	  use of sync fences in the Mali driver.

	  This will add a 3s timeout to all sync fence waits in the Mali
	  driver, so that when work for Mali has been waiting on a sync fence
	  for a long time a debug message will be printed, detailing what fence
	  is causing the block, and which dependent Mali atoms are blocked as a
	  result of this.

	  The timeout can be changed at runtime through the js_soft_timeout
	  device attribute, where the timeout is specified in milliseconds.

choice
	prompt "Error injection level"
	default MALI_ERROR_INJECT_NONE
	help
	  Enables insertion of errors to test module failure and recovery mechanisms.

config MALI_ERROR_INJECT_NONE
	bool "disabled"
	help
	  Error injection is disabled.

config MALI_ERROR_INJECT_TRACK_LIST
	bool "error track list"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT && NO_MALI
	help
	  Errors to inject are pre-configured by the user.

config MALI_ERROR_INJECT_RANDOM
	bool "random error injection"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT && NO_MALI
	help
	  Injected errors are random, rather than user-driven.

config MALI_BIFROST_SYSTEM_TRACE
	bool "Enable system event tracing support"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to enable system trace events for each
	  kbase event.	This is typically used for debugging but has
	  minimal overhead when not in use. Enable only if you know what
	  you are doing.

config MALI_2MB_ALLOC
	bool "Attempt to allocate 2MB pages"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	  Rather than allocating all GPU memory page-by-page, attempt to
	  allocate 2MB pages from the kernel. This reduces TLB pressure and
	  helps to prevent memory fragmentation.

	  If in doubt, say N

config MALI_PWRSOFT_765
	bool "PWRSOFT-765 ticket"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT
	default n
	help
	  PWRSOFT-765 fixes devfreq cooling devices issues. However, they are
	  not merged in mainline kernel yet. So this define helps to guard those
	  parts of the code.

config MALI_MEMORY_FULLY_BACKED
	bool "Memory fully physically-backed"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables full backing of all virtual memory allocations
	  for the kernel. This only affects grow-on-GPU-page-fault memory.

	bool "Map imported dma-bufs on demand"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST
	default n
	default y if !DMA_BUF_SYNC_IOCTL_SUPPORTED
	help
	  This option caused kbase to set up the GPU mapping of imported
	  dma-buf when needed to run atoms.  This is the legacy behaviour.

config MALI_DMA_BUF_LEGACY_COMPAT
	bool "Enable legacy compatibility cache flush on dma-buf map"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && !MALI_DMA_BUF_MAP_ON_DEMAND
	default y
	help
	  This option enables compatibility with legacy dma-buf mapping
	  behavior, then the dma-buf is mapped on import, by adding cache
	  maintenance where MALI_DMA_BUF_MAP_ON_DEMAND would do the mapping,
	  including a cache flush.

	default n
	default y if PLATFORM_JUNO
	help
	  This option disables the default workaround for GPU2017-1336. The
	  workaround keeps the L2 cache powered up except for powerdown and reset.

	  The workaround introduces a limitation that will prevent the running of
	  protected mode content on fully coherent platforms, as the switch to IO
	  coherency mode requires the L2 to be turned off.

config MALI_HW_ERRATA_1485982_USE_CLOCK_ALTERNATIVE
	bool "Use alternative workaround for BASE_HW_ISSUE_GPU2017_1336"
	depends on MALI_BIFROST && MALI_BIFROST_EXPERT && !MALI_HW_ERRATA_1485982_NOT_AFFECTED
	default n
	help
	  This option uses an alternative workaround for GPU2017-1336. Lowering
	  the GPU clock to a, platform specific, known good frequeuncy before
	  powering down the L2 cache. The clock can be specified in the device
	  tree using the property, opp-mali-errata-1485982. Otherwise the
	  slowest clock will be selected.
