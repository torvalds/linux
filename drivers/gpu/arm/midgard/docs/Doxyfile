# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories
# with spaces.

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that acts
# as commands in the documentation. An alias has the form "name=value".
# For example adding "sideeffect=\par Side Effects:\n" will allow you to
# put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the documentation, which
# will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading "Side Effects:".
# You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert newlines.

# The ENABLED_SECTIONS tag can be used to enable conditional
# documentation sections, marked by \if sectionname ... \endif.

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left
# blank the following patterns are tested:
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh *.hxx
# *.hpp *.h++ *.idl *.odl *.cs *.php *.php3 *.inc *.m *.mm *.py *.f90

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the

# against the file with absolute path, so to exclude all test directories
# for example use the pattern */test/*

EXCLUDE_PATTERNS       +=

# The EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS tag can be used to specify one or more symbol names
# (namespaces, classes, functions, etc.) that should be excluded from the
# output. The symbol name can be a fully qualified name, a word, or if the
# wildcard * is used, a substring. Examples: ANamespace, AClass,
# AClass::ANamespace, ANamespace::*Test

# the preprocessor.

INCLUDE_PATH           +=

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that
# are defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name
# or name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the = are
# omitted =1 is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being
# undefined via #undef or recursively expanded use the := operator
# instead of the = operator.

PREDEFINED             +=

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION and EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF tags are set to YES then
# this tag can be used to specify a list of macro names that should be expanded.
# The macro definition that is found in the sources will be used.
# Use the PREDEFINED tag if you want to use a different macro definition.

# The DOTFILE_DIRS tag can be used to specify one or more directories that
