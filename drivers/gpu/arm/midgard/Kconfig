	default n
	help
	  Enable this option to build support for a ARM Mali Midgard GPU.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  this will generate a single module, called mali_kbase.

choice
	prompt "Streamline support"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD
	default MALI_TIMELINE_DISABLED
	help
	  Select streamline support configuration.

config MALI_TIMELINE_DISABLED
	bool "Streamline support disabled"
	help
	  Disable support for ARM Streamline Performance Analyzer.

	  Timeline support will not be included in
	  kernel code.
	  Debug stream will not be generated.

config MALI_GATOR_SUPPORT
	bool "Streamline support via Gator"
	help
	  Adds diagnostic support for use with the ARM Streamline Performance Analyzer.
	  You will need the Gator device driver already loaded before loading this driver when enabling
	  Streamline debug support.

config MALI_MIPE_ENABLED
	bool "Streamline support via MIPE"
	help
	  Adds diagnostic support for use with the ARM Streamline Performance Analyzer.

	  Stream will be transmitted directly to Mali GPU library.
	  Compatible version of the library is required to read debug stream generated by kernel.
