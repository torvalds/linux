	  Kernel-level support for the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)
	  introduced in XFree86 4.0. If you say Y here, you need to select
	  the module that's right for your graphics card from the list below.
	  These modules provide support for synchronization, security, and
	  DMA transfers. Please see <http://dri.sourceforge.net/> for more
	  details.  You should also select and configure AGP
	  (/dev/agpgart) support if it is available for your platform.

	  Say Y here, if you want to use EDID data to be loaded from the
	  /lib/firmware directory or one of the provided built-in
	  data sets. This may be necessary, if the graphics adapter or
	  monitor are unable to provide appropriate EDID data. Since this
	  feature is provided as a workaround for broken hardware, the
	  default case is N. Details and instructions how to build your own
	  EDID data are given in Documentation/EDID/HOWTO.txt.
