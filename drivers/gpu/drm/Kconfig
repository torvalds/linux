	  Kernel-level support for the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)
	  introduced in XFree86 4.0. If you say Y here, you need to select
	  the module that's right for your graphics card from the list below.
	  These modules provide support for synchronization, security, and
	  DMA transfers. Please see <http://dri.sourceforge.net/> for more
	  details.  You should also select and configure AGP
	  (/dev/agpgart) support if it is available for your platform.

config DRM_TTM

	help
	  GPU memory management subsystem for devices with multiple
	  GPU memory types. Will be enabled automatically if a device driver
	  uses it.

config DRM_TDFX
	tristate "3dfx Banshee/Voodoo3+"
	depends on DRM && PCI
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a 3dfx Banshee or Voodoo3 (or later),
	  graphics card.  If M is selected, the module will be called tdfx.

config DRM_R128
	tristate "ATI Rage 128"
	depends on DRM && PCI
	select FW_LOADER
	help
	  Choose this option if you have an ATI Rage 128 graphics card.  If M
	  is selected, the module will be called r128.  AGP support for
	  this card is strongly suggested (unless you have a PCI version).

config DRM_RADEON

	select HWMON
	help
	  Choose this option if you have an ATI Radeon graphics card.  There
	  are both PCI and AGP versions.  You don't need to choose this to
	  run the Radeon in plain VGA mode.

	  If M is selected, the module will be called radeon.

config DRM_I810

	# !PREEMPT because of missing ioctl locking
	depends on DRM && AGP && AGP_INTEL && (!PREEMPT || BROKEN)
	help
	  Choose this option if you have an Intel I810 graphics card.  If M is
	  selected, the module will be called i810.  AGP support is required
	  for this driver to work.

	  Choose this option if you have a system that has "Intel Graphics
	  Media Accelerator" or "HD Graphics" integrated graphics,
	  including 830M, 845G, 852GM, 855GM, 865G, 915G, 945G, 965G,
	  G35, G41, G43, G45 chipsets and Celeron, Pentium, Core i3,
	  Core i5, Core i7 as well as Atom CPUs with integrated graphics.
	  If M is selected, the module will be called i915.  AGP support
	  is required for this driver to work. This driver is used by
	  the Intel driver in X.org 6.8 and XFree86 4.4 and above. It
	  replaces the older i830 module that supported a subset of the
	  hardware in older X.org releases.

	  Note that the older i810/i815 chipsets require the use of the
	  i810 driver instead, and the Atom z5xx series has an entirely
	  different implementation.

config DRM_I915_KMS
	bool "Enable modesetting on intel by default"
	depends on DRM_I915
	help
	  Choose this option if you want kernel modesetting enabled by default,
	  and you have a new enough userspace to support this. Running old
	  userspaces with this enabled will cause pain.  Note that this causes
	  the driver to bind to PCI devices, which precludes loading things
	  like intelfb.

config DRM_MGA
	tristate "Matrox g200/g400"
	depends on DRM && PCI
	select FW_LOADER
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a Matrox G200, G400 or G450 graphics
	  card.  If M is selected, the module will be called mga.  AGP
	  support is required for this driver to work.

config DRM_SIS
	tristate "SiS video cards"
	depends on DRM && AGP
	depends on FB_SIS || FB_SIS=n
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a SiS 630 or compatible video
          chipset. If M is selected the module will be called sis. AGP
          support is required for this driver to work.

config DRM_VIA
	tristate "Via unichrome video cards"
	depends on DRM && PCI
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a Via unichrome or compatible video
	  chipset. If M is selected the module will be called via.

config DRM_SAVAGE
	tristate "Savage video cards"
	depends on DRM && PCI
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a Savage3D/4/SuperSavage/Pro/Twister
	  chipset. If M is selected the module will be called savage.
