	  This is a KMS driver for the virtual Graphics Card used in
	  Virtual Box virtual machines.

	  Although it is possible to build this driver built-in to the
	  kernel, it is advised to build it as a module, so that it can
	  be updated independently of the kernel. Select M to build this
	  driver as a module and add support for these devices via drm/kms
	  interfaces.
