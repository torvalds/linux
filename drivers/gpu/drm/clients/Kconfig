	  Enables the DRM client selection. DRM drivers that support the

	  Choose this option if you have a need for the legacy fbdev
	  support. Note that this support also provides the linux console
	  support on top of your modesetting driver.

	  Defines the fbdev buffer overallocation in percent. Default
	  is 100. Typical values for double buffering will be 200,
	  triple buffering 300.

config DRM_FBDEV_LEAK_PHYS_SMEM

	default n
	help
	  In order to keep user-space compatibility, we want in certain
	  use-cases to keep leaking the fbdev physical address to the
	  user-space program handling the fbdev buffer.
	  This affects, not only, Amlogic, Allwinner or Rockchip devices
	  with ARM Mali GPUs using a userspace Blob.
	  This option is not supported by upstream developers and should be
	  removed as soon as possible and be considered as a broken and
	  legacy behaviour from a modern fbdev device driver.

	  Please send any bug reports when using this to your proprietary
	  software vendor that requires this.

	  If in doubt, say "N" or spread the word to your closed source
	  library vendor.

	  This enable a drm logger, that will print the kernel messages to the

	  The selection made here can be overridden by using the kernel
	  command line 'drm_client_lib.active=fbdev' option.

config DRM_CLIENT_DEFAULT_FBDEV
	bool "fbdev"
	depends on DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION
	help
	  Use fbdev emulation as default drm client. This is needed to have
	  fbcon on top of a drm driver.

config DRM_CLIENT_DEFAULT_LOG
	bool "log"
	depends on DRM_CLIENT_LOG
	help
	  Use drm log as default drm client. This will display boot logs on the
	  screen, but doesn't implement a full terminal. For that you will need
	  a userspace terminal using drm/kms.
