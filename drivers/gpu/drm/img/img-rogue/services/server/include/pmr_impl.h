@Description    Called to lock down the physical addresses for all pages

                The default implementation is to simply increment a

                be called when someone first requires a physical address,
                and the PFN_UNLOCK_PHYS_ADDRESSES_FN counterpart will be
                called when the last such reference is released.
                The PMR implementation may assume that physical addresses
                will have been "locked" in this manner before any call is
                made to the pfnDevPhysAddr() callback
