config VGA_ARB
	bool "VGA Arbitration" if EXPERT
	default y
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Some "legacy" VGA devices implemented on PCI typically have the same
	  hard-decoded addresses as they did on ISA. When multiple PCI devices
	  are accessed at same time they need some kind of coordination. Please
	  see Documentation/vgaarbiter.txt for more details. Select this to
	  enable VGA arbiter.

config VGA_ARB_MAX_GPUS
	int "Maximum number of GPUs"
	default 16
	depends on VGA_ARB
	help
	  Reserves space in the kernel to maintain resource locking for
	  multiple GPUS.  The overhead for each GPU is very small.

config VGA_SWITCHEROO
	bool "Laptop Hybrid Graphics - GPU switching support"
	depends on X86
	depends on ACPI
	help
	  Many laptops released in 2008/9/10 have two GPUs with a multiplexer
	  to switch between them. This adds support for dynamic switching when
          X isn't running and delayed switching until the next logoff. This
	  feature is called hybrid graphics, ATI PowerXpress, and Nvidia
	  HybridPower.
