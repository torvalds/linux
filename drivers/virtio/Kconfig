	help
	  This driver provides support for virtio based paravirtual device
	  drivers over PCI.  This requires that your VMM has appropriate PCI
	  virtio backends.  Most QEMU based VMMs should support these devices
	  (like KVM or Xen).

	  If unsure, say M.

	help
          Virtio PCI Card 0.9.X Draft (circa 2014) and older device support.

	  This option enables building a transitional driver, supporting
	  both devices conforming to Virtio 1 specification, and legacy devices.
	  If disabled, you get a slightly smaller, non-transitional driver,
	  with no legacy compatibility.

          So look out into your driveway.  Do you have a flying car?  If
          so, you can happily disable this option and virtio will not
          break.  Otherwise, leave it set.  Unless you're testing what
          life will be like in The Future.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	select VIRTIO
	help
	  This driver provides support for virtio based paravirtual
	  device driver over vDPA bus. For this to be useful, you need
	  an appropriate vDPA device implementation that operates on a
	  physical device to allow the datapath of virtio to be
	  offloaded to hardware.
