	  If you say yes here you get support for the generic Intel PECI
	  cputemp driver which provides Digital Thermal Sensor (DTS) thermal
	  readings of the CPU package and CPU cores that are accessible via
	  the processor PECI interface.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called peci-cputemp.
