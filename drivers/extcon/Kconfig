	  Say Y here to enable external connector class (extcon) support.
	  This allows monitoring external connectors by userspace
	  via sysfs and uevent and supports external connectors with
	  multiple states; i.e., an extcon that may have multiple
	  cables attached. For example, an external connector of a device
	  may be used to connect an HDMI cable and a AC adaptor, and to
	  host USB ports. Many of 30-pin connectors including PDMI are
	  also good examples.
