 * See Documentation/cdrom/ide-cd for usage information.
 *
 * Suggestions are welcome. Patches that work are more welcome though. ;-)
 * For those wishing to work on this driver, please be sure you download
 * and comply with the latest Mt. Fuji (SFF8090 version 4) and ATAPI 
 * (SFF-8020i rev 2.6) standards. These documents can be obtained by 
 * anonymous ftp from:
 * ftp://fission.dt.wdc.com/pub/standards/SFF_atapi/spec/SFF8020-r2.6/PS/8020r26.ps
 * ftp://ftp.avc-pioneer.com/Mtfuji4/Spec/Fuji4r10.pdf
 *
 * Drives that deviate from these standards will be accommodated as much
 * as possible via compile time or command-line options.  Since I only have
 * a few drives, you generally need to send me patches...

 *                        blocks (like Pioneer drives).  Thanks to

 *                         was never returned due to a comparison on data
 *                         types of limited range.
 * 4.12  Mar 29, 1998  -- Fixed bug in CDROM_SELECT_SPEED so write speed is 
 *                         now set ionly for CD-R and CD-RW drives.  I had 
 *                         removed this support because it produced errors.
 *                         It produced errors _only_ for non-writers. duh.
 * 4.13  May 05, 1998  -- Suppress useless "in progress of becoming ready"
 *                         messages, since this is not an error.
 *                     -- Change error messages to be const

 * 4.14  July 17, 1998 -- Change to pointing to .ps version of ATAPI spec

 *
 * 4.15  Aug 25, 1998  -- Updated ide-cd.h to respect mechine endianess,

 *
 * 4.51  Dec 23, 1998  -- Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
 *                      - ide_cdrom_reset enabled since the ide subsystem
 *                         handles resets fine now. <axboe@image.dk>
 *                      - Transfer size fix for Samsung CD-ROMs, thanks to
 *                        "Ville Hallik" <ville.hallik@mail.ee>.
 *                      - other minor stuff.
 *
 * 4.52  Jan 19, 1999  -- Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
 *                      - Detect DVD-ROM/RAM drives
 *
 * 4.53  Feb 22, 1999   - Include other model Samsung and one Goldstar
 *                         drive in transfer size limit.
 *                      - Fix the I/O error when doing eject without a medium
 *                         loaded on some drives.
 *                      - CDROMREADMODE2 is now implemented through
 *                         CDROMREADRAW, since many drives don't support
 *                         MODE2 (even though ATAPI 2.6 says they must).
 *                      - Added ignore parameter to ide-cd (as a module), eg
 *                         	insmod ide-cd ignore='hda hdb'
 *                         Useful when using ide-cd in conjunction with
 *                         ide-scsi. TODO: non-modular way of doing the
 *                         same.
 *
 * 4.54  Aug 5, 1999	- Support for MMC2 class commands through the generic
 *			  packet interface to cdrom.c.
 *			- Unified audio ioctl support, most of it.
 *			- cleaned up various deprecated verify_area().
 *			- Added ide_cdrom_packet() as the interface for
 *			  the Uniform generic_packet().
 *			- bunch of other stuff, will fill in logs later.
 *			- report 1 slot for non-changers, like the other
 *			  cd-rom drivers. don't report select disc for
 *			  non-changers as well.
 *			- mask out audio playing, if the device can't do it.
 *
 * 4.55  Sep 1, 1999	- Eliminated the rest of the audio ioctls, except
 *			  for CDROMREADTOC[ENTRY|HEADER]. Some of the drivers
 *			  use this independently of the actual audio handling.
 *			  They will disappear later when I get the time to
 *			  do it cleanly.
 *			- Minimize the TOC reading - only do it when we
 *			  know a media change has occurred.
 *			- Moved all the CDROMREADx ioctls to the Uniform layer.
 *			- Heiko Eissfeldt <heiko@colossus.escape.de> supplied
 *			  some fixes for CDI.
 *			- CD-ROM leaving door locked fix from Andries
 *			  Brouwer <Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl>
 *			- Erik Andersen <andersen@xmission.com> unified
 *			  commands across the various drivers and how
 *			  sense errors are handled.
 *
 * 4.56  Sep 12, 1999	- Removed changer support - it is now in the
 *			  Uniform layer.
 *			- Added partition based multisession handling.
 *			- Mode sense and mode select moved to the
 *			  Uniform layer.
 *			- Fixed a problem with WPI CDS-32X drive - it
 *			  failed the capabilities 
 *
 * 4.57  Apr 7, 2000	- Fixed sense reporting.
 *			- Fixed possible oops in ide_cdrom_get_last_session()
 *			- Fix locking mania and make ide_cdrom_reset relock
 *			- Stop spewing errors to log when magicdev polls with
 *			  TEST_UNIT_READY on some drives.
 *			- Various fixes from Tobias Ringstrom:
 *			  tray if it was locked prior to the reset.
 *			  - cdrom_read_capacity returns one frame too little.
 *			  - Fix real capacity reporting.
 *
 * 4.58  May 1, 2000	- Clean up ACER50 stuff.
 *			- Fix small problem with ide_cdrom_capacity
 *
 * 4.59  Aug 11, 2000	- Fix changer problem in cdrom_read_toc, we weren't
 *			  correctly sensing a disc change.
 *			- Rearranged some code
 *			- Use extended sense on drives that support it for
 *			  correctly reporting tray status -- from
 *			  Michael D Johnson <johnsom@orst.edu>
 * 4.60  Dec 17, 2003	- Add mt rainier support
