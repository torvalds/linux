	  Say Y here if you want to enable checking if the bootloader has
	  already initialized the display controller. In this case the

	  Increase the DMA consistent memory size according to your video
	  memory needs, for example if you want to use multiple planes.
	  The size must be 2MB aligned.
	  If unsure say 1.

          On systems in which video memory is in system memory
          (SDRAM) this will speed up graphics DMA operations.
          If you have such a system and want to use rotation
          answer yes. Answer no if you have a dedicated video
          memory, or don't use any of the accelerated features.
