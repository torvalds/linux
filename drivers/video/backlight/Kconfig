config LCD_CLASS_DEVICE
        tristate "Lowlevel LCD controls"
	depends on BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT
	default m
	help
	  This framework adds support for low-level control of LCD.
	  Some framebuffer devices connect to platform-specific LCD modules
	  in order to have a platform-specific way to control the flat panel
	  (contrast and applying power to the LCD (not to the backlight!)).

	  To have support for your specific LCD panel you will have to
	  select the proper drivers which depend on this option.

config LCD_CORGI
	tristate "LCD Panel support for SHARP corgi/spitz model"
	depends on LCD_CLASS_DEVICE && SPI_MASTER && PXA_SHARPSL
	help
	  Say y here to support the LCD panels usually found on SHARP
	  corgi (C7x0) and spitz (Cxx00) models.

config LCD_LTV350QV
	tristate "Samsung LTV350QV LCD Panel"
	depends on LCD_CLASS_DEVICE && SPI_MASTER
	default n
	help
	  If you have a Samsung LTV350QV LCD panel, say y to include a
	  power control driver for it.  The panel starts up in power
	  off state, so you need this driver in order to see any
	  output.

	  The LTV350QV panel is present on all ATSTK1000 boards.

config LCD_ILI9320
	tristate
	depends on LCD_CLASS_DEVICE && BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT
	default n
	help
	  If you have a panel based on the ILI9320 controller chip
	  then say y to include a power driver for it.

config LCD_TDO24M

config BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
        tristate "Lowlevel Backlight controls"
	depends on BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT
	default m
	help
	  This framework adds support for low-level control of the LCD
          backlight. This includes support for brightness and power.

	  To have support for your specific LCD panel you will have to
	  select the proper drivers which depend on this option.

config BACKLIGHT_ATMEL_LCDC
	bool "Atmel LCDC Contrast-as-Backlight control"
	depends on BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE && FB_ATMEL
	default y if MACH_SAM9261EK || MACH_SAM9263EK
	help
	  This provides a backlight control internal to the Atmel LCDC
	  driver.  If the LCD "contrast control" on your board is wired
	  so it controls the backlight brightness, select this option to
	  export this as a PWM-based backlight control.

	  If in doubt, it's safe to enable this option; it doesn't kick
	  in unless the board's description says it's wired that way.

config BACKLIGHT_ATMEL_PWM
	tristate "Atmel PWM backlight control"
	depends on BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE && ATMEL_PWM
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use the PWM peripheral in Atmel AT91 and
	  AVR32 devices. This driver will need additional platform data to know
	  which PWM instance to use and how to configure it.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called atmel-pwm-bl.

config BACKLIGHT_GENERIC
	tristate "Generic (aka Sharp Corgi) Backlight Driver"
	depends on BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
	default y
	help
	  Say y to enable the generic platform backlight driver previously
	  known as the Corgi backlight driver. If you have a Sharp Zaurus
	  SL-C7xx, SL-Cxx00 or SL-6000x say y.

config BACKLIGHT_LOCOMO
	tristate "Sharp LOCOMO LCD/Backlight Driver"
	depends on BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE && SHARP_LOCOMO
