config LCD_CLASS_DEVICE
        tristate "Lowlevel LCD controls"
	depends on BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT
	default m
	help
	  This framework adds support for low-level control of LCD.
	  Some framebuffer devices connect to platform-specific LCD modules
	  in order to have a platform-specific way to control the flat panel
	  (contrast and applying power to the LCD (not to the backlight!)).

	  To have support for your specific LCD panel you will have to
	  select the proper drivers which depend on this option.

	help
	  This provides a backlight control internal to the Atmel LCDC
	  driver.  If the LCD "contrast control" on your board is wired
	  so it controls the backlight brightness, select this option to
	  export this as a PWM-based backlight control.

	  If in doubt, it's safe to enable this option; it doesn't kick
	  in unless the board's description says it's wired that way.

config BACKLIGHT_ATMEL_PWM
