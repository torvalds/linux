config TEGRA_GRHOST
	tristate "Tegra graphics host driver"

	  Driver for the Tegra graphics host hardware.

config TEGRA_DC
	tristate "Tegra Display Contoller"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA
	select FB_MODE_HELPERS
	select I2C
	help
	  Tegra display controller support.

	depends on TEGRA_DC && FB = y
	select FB_CFB_FILLRECT
	select FB_CFB_COPYAREA
	select FB_CFB_IMAGEBLIT
	default FB
	help
	  Framebuffer device support for the Tegra display controller.

config TEGRA_NVMAP
	bool "Tegra GPU memory management driver (nvmap)"
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to include the memory management driver for the Tegra
	  GPU, multimedia and display subsystems

config NVMAP_RECLAIM_UNPINNED_VM
	bool "Virtualize IOVMM memory in nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP && TEGRA_IOVMM
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to enable nvmap to reclaim I/O virtual memory after
	  it has been unpinned, and re-use it for other handles. This can
	  allow a larger virtual I/O VM space than would normally be
	  supported by the hardware, at a slight cost in performance.

config NVMAP_ALLOW_SYSMEM
	bool "Allow physical system memory to be used by nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to allow nvmap to use physical system memory (i.e.,
	  shared with the operating system but not translated through
	  an IOVMM device) for allocations.

config NVMAP_HIGHMEM_ONLY
	bool "Use only HIGHMEM for nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP && (NVMAP_ALLOW_SYSMEM || TEGRA_IOVMM) && HIGHMEM
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to restrict nvmap system memory allocations (both
	  physical system memory and IOVMM) to just HIGHMEM pages.

config NVMAP_CARVEOUT_KILLER
	bool "Reclaim nvmap carveout by killing processes"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to allow the system to reclaim carveout space by killing
	  processes. This will kill the largest consumers of lowest priority
	  first.
