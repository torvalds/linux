config VGA_CONSOLE
	bool "VGA text console" if EMBEDDED || !X86
	depends on !ARCH_ACORN && !ARCH_EBSA110 && !4xx && !8xx && !SPARC && !M68K && !PARISC && !FRV && !ARCH_VERSATILE && !SUPERH && !BLACKFIN && !AVR32 && !MN10300
	default y
	help
	  Saying Y here will allow you to use Linux in text mode through a
	  display that complies with the generic VGA standard. Virtually
	  everyone wants that.

	  The program SVGATextMode can be used to utilize SVGA video cards to
	  their full potential in text mode. Download it from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/console/>.

	  Say Y.

config VGACON_SOFT_SCROLLBACK
       bool "Enable Scrollback Buffer in System RAM"
       depends on VGA_CONSOLE
       default n
       help
         The scrollback buffer of the standard VGA console is located in
	 the VGA RAM.  The size of this RAM is fixed and is quite small.
	 If you require a larger scrollback buffer, this can be placed in
	 System RAM which is dynamically allocated during initialization.
	 Placing the scrollback buffer in System RAM will slightly slow
	 down the console.

	 If you want this feature, say 'Y' here and enter the amount of
	 RAM to allocate for this buffer.  If unsure, say 'N'.

config VGACON_SOFT_SCROLLBACK_SIZE
       int "Scrollback Buffer Size (in KB)"
       depends on VGACON_SOFT_SCROLLBACK
       default "64"
       help
         Enter the amount of System RAM to allocate for the scrollback
	 buffer.  Each 64KB will give you approximately 16 80x25
	 screenfuls of scrollback buffer

config MDA_CONSOLE
	depends on !M68K && !PARISC && ISA
	tristate "MDA text console (dual-headed) (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have an old MDA or monochrome Hercules graphics
	  adapter in your system acting as a second head ( = video card). You
	  will then be able to use two monitors with your Linux system. Do not
	  say Y here if your MDA card is the primary card in your system; the
	  normal VGA driver will handle it.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called mdacon.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SGI_NEWPORT_CONSOLE
        tristate "SGI Newport Console support"
        depends on SGI_IP22 
        help
          Say Y here if you want the console on the Newport aka XL graphics
          card of your Indy.  Most people say Y here.

#  bool 'IODC console' CONFIG_IODC_CONSOLE

config DUMMY_CONSOLE
	bool
	depends on VGA_CONSOLE!=y || SGI_NEWPORT_CONSOLE!=y 
	default y

config DUMMY_CONSOLE_COLUMNS
        int "Initial number of console screen columns"
        depends on PARISC && DUMMY_CONSOLE
        default "160"
        help
          The default value is 160, which should fit a 1280x1024 monitor.
          Select 80 if you use a 640x480 resolution by default.

config DUMMY_CONSOLE_ROWS
        int "Initial number of console screen rows"
        depends on PARISC && DUMMY_CONSOLE
        default "64"
        help
          The default value is 64, which should fit a 1280x1024 monitor.
          Select 25 if you use a 640x480 resolution by default.

config FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE
	tristate "Framebuffer Console support"
	depends on FB
	select CRC32
	help
	  Low-level framebuffer-based console driver.

config FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_DETECT_PRIMARY
       bool "Map the console to the primary display device"
       depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE
       default n
       ---help---
         If this option is selected, the framebuffer console will
         automatically select the primary display device (if the architecture
	 supports this feature).  Otherwise, the framebuffer console will
         always select the first framebuffer driver that is loaded. The latter
         is the default behavior.

	 You can always override the automatic selection of the primary device
	 by using the fbcon=map: boot option.

	 If unsure, select n.

config FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_ROTATION
       bool "Framebuffer Console Rotation"
       depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE
       help
         Enable display rotation for the framebuffer console.  This is done
         in software and may be significantly slower than a normally oriented
         display.  Note that the rotation is done at the console level only
         such that other users of the framebuffer will remain normally
         oriented.

config STI_CONSOLE
        bool "STI text console"
        depends on PARISC
        default y
        help
          The STI console is the builtin display/keyboard on HP-PARISC
          machines.  Say Y here to build support for it into your kernel.
          The alternative is to use your primary serial port as a console.

config FONTS
	bool "Select compiled-in fonts"
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE || STI_CONSOLE
	help
	  Say Y here if you would like to use fonts other than the default
	  your frame buffer console usually use.

	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about foreign fonts.

	  If unsure, say N (the default choices are safe).

config FONT_8x8
	bool "VGA 8x8 font" if FONTS
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE || STI_CONSOLE
	default y if !SPARC && !FONTS
	help
	  This is the "high resolution" font for the VGA frame buffer (the one
	  provided by the text console 80x50 (and higher) modes).

	  Note that this is a poor quality font. The VGA 8x16 font is quite a
	  lot more readable.

	  Given the resolution provided by the frame buffer device, answer N
	  here is safe.

config FONT_8x16
	bool "VGA 8x16 font" if FONTS
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE || SGI_NEWPORT_CONSOLE || STI_CONSOLE || USB_SISUSBVGA_CON
	default y if !SPARC && !FONTS
	help
	  This is the "high resolution" font for the VGA frame buffer (the one
	  provided by the VGA text console 80x25 mode.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config FONT_6x11
	bool "Mac console 6x11 font (not supported by all drivers)" if FONTS
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE || STI_CONSOLE
	default y if !SPARC && !FONTS && MAC
	help
	  Small console font with Macintosh-style high-half glyphs.  Some Mac
	  framebuffer drivers don't support this one at all.

config FONT_7x14
	bool "console 7x14 font (not supported by all drivers)" if FONTS
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE
	help
	  Console font with characters just a bit smaller than the default.
	  If the standard 8x16 font is a little too big for you, say Y.
	  Otherwise, say N.

config FONT_PEARL_8x8
	bool "Pearl (old m68k) console 8x8 font" if FONTS
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE
	default y if !SPARC && !FONTS && AMIGA
	help
	  Small console font with PC-style control-character and high-half
	  glyphs.

config FONT_ACORN_8x8
	bool "Acorn console 8x8 font" if FONTS
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE
	default y if !SPARC && !FONTS && ARM && ARCH_ACORN
	help
	  Small console font with PC-style control characters and high-half
	  glyphs.

config FONT_MINI_4x6

	depends on !SPARC && FONTS

config FONT_SUN8x16
	bool "Sparc console 8x16 font"
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE && (!SPARC && FONTS || SPARC)
	help
	  This is the high resolution console font for Sun machines. Say Y.

config FONT_SUN12x22
	bool "Sparc console 12x22 font (not supported by all drivers)"
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE && (!SPARC && FONTS || SPARC)
	help
	  This is the high resolution console font for Sun machines with very
	  big letters (like the letters used in the SPARC PROM). If the
	  standard font is unreadable for you, say Y, otherwise say N.

config FONT_10x18
	bool "console 10x18 font (not supported by all drivers)" if FONTS
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE
	help
	  This is a high resolution console font for machines with very
	  big letters. It fits between the sun 12x22 and the normal 8x16 font.
	  If other fonts are too big or too small for you, say Y, otherwise say N.
