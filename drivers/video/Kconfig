config FB
	tristate "Support for frame buffer devices"
	---help---
	  The frame buffer device provides an abstraction for the graphics
	  hardware. It represents the frame buffer of some video hardware and
	  allows application software to access the graphics hardware through
	  a well-defined interface, so the software doesn't need to know
	  anything about the low-level (hardware register) stuff.

	  Frame buffer devices work identically across the different
	  architectures supported by Linux and make the implementation of
	  application programs easier and more portable; at this point, an X
	  server exists which uses the frame buffer device exclusively.
	  On several non-X86 architectures, the frame buffer device is the
	  only way to use the graphics hardware.

	  The device is accessed through special device nodes, usually located
	  in the /dev directory, i.e. /dev/fb*.

	  You need an utility program called fbset to make full use of frame
	  buffer devices. Please read <file:Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt>
	  and the Framebuffer-HOWTO at
	  <http://www.tahallah.demon.co.uk/programming/prog.html> for more
	  information.

	  Say Y here and to the driver for your graphics board below if you
	  are compiling a kernel for a non-x86 architecture.

	  If you are compiling for the x86 architecture, you can say Y if you
	  want to play with it, but it is not essential. Please note that
	  running graphical applications that directly touch the hardware
	  (e.g. an accelerated X server) and that are not frame buffer
	  device-aware may cause unexpected results. If unsure, say N.

config FB_CFB_FILLRECT
	tristate
	depends on FB
	default n
	---help---
	  Include the cfb_fillrect function for generic software rectangle
	  filling. This is used by drivers that don't provide their own
	  (accelerated) version.

config FB_CFB_COPYAREA
	tristate
	depends on FB
	default n
	---help---
	  Include the cfb_copyarea function for generic software area copying.
	  This is used by drivers that don't provide their own (accelerated)
	  version.

config FB_CFB_IMAGEBLIT
	tristate
	depends on FB
	default n
	---help---
	  Include the cfb_imageblit function for generic software image
	  blitting. This is used by drivers that don't provide their own
	  (accelerated) version.

config FB_MACMODES

config FB_FIRMWARE_EDID
       bool "Enable firmware EDID"
       depends on FB
       default y
       ---help---
         This enables access to the EDID transferred from the firmware.
	 On the i386, this is from the Video BIOS. Enable this if DDC/I2C
	 transfers do not work for your driver and if you are using
	 nvidiafb, i810fb or savagefb.

	 In general, choosing Y for this option is safe.  If you
	 experience extremely long delays while booting before you get
	 something on your display, try setting this to N.  Matrox cards in
	 combination with certain motherboards and monitors are known to
	 suffer from this problem.

config FB_MODE_HELPERS
        bool "Enable Video Mode Handling Helpers"
        depends on FB
	default n
	---help---
	  This enables functions for handling video modes using the
	  Generalized Timing Formula and the EDID parser. A few drivers rely
          on this feature such as the radeonfb, rivafb, and the i810fb. If
	  your driver does not take advantage of this feature, choosing Y will
	  just increase the kernel size by about 5K.

config FB_TILEBLITTING
       bool "Enable Tile Blitting Support"
       depends on FB
       default n
       ---help---
         This enables tile blitting.  Tile blitting is a drawing technique
	 where the screen is divided into rectangular sections (tiles), whereas
	 the standard blitting divides the screen into pixels. Because the
	 default drawing element is a tile, drawing functions will be passed
	 parameters in terms of number of tiles instead of number of pixels.
	 For example, to draw a single character, instead of using bitmaps,
	 an index to an array of bitmaps will be used.  To clear or move a
	 rectangular section of a screen, the rectangle will be described in
	 terms of number of tiles in the x- and y-axis.

	 This is particularly important to one driver, matroxfb.  If
	 unsure, say N.

	  If you say Y, then the VESA standard, Generalized Timing Formula 
          or GTF, will be used to calculate the required video timing values
	  per video mode.  Since the GTF allows nondiscrete timings 
          (nondiscrete being a range of values as opposed to discrete being a
          set of values), you'll be able to use any combination of horizontal 
	  and vertical resolutions, and vertical refresh rates without having
	  to specify your own timing parameters.  This is especially useful
	  to maximize the performance of an aging display, or if you just 
          have a display with nonstandard dimensions. A VESA compliant 
	  monitor is recommended, but can still work with non-compliant ones.
	  If you need or want this, then select this option. The timings may 
	  not be compliant with Intel's recommended values. Use at your own 
	  risk.

          If you say N, the driver will revert to discrete video timings 
	  using a set recommended by Intel in their documentation.

	  This is a `virtual' frame buffer device. It operates on a chunk of
	  unswappable kernel memory instead of on the memory of a graphics
	  board. This means you cannot see any output sent to this frame
	  buffer device, while it does consume precious memory. The main use
	  of this frame buffer device is testing and debugging the frame
	  buffer subsystem. Do NOT enable it for normal systems! To protect
	  the innocent, it has to be enabled explicitly at boot time using the
	  kernel option `video=vfb:'.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called vfb.

	  If unsure, say N.
