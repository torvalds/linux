	help
	  The frame buffer device provides an abstraction for the graphics
	  hardware. It represents the frame buffer of some video hardware and
	  allows application software to access the graphics hardware through
	  a well-defined interface, so the software doesn't need to know
	  anything about the low-level (hardware register) stuff.

	  Frame buffer devices work identically across the different
	  architectures supported by Linux and make the implementation of
	  application programs easier and more portable; at this point, an X
	  server exists which uses the frame buffer device exclusively.
	  On several non-X86 architectures, the frame buffer device is the
	  only way to use the graphics hardware.

	  The device is accessed through special device nodes, usually located
	  in the /dev directory, i.e. /dev/fb*.

	  You need an utility program called fbset to make full use of frame
	  buffer devices. Please read <file:Documentation/fb/framebuffer.rst>
	  and the Framebuffer-HOWTO at
	  <http://www.munted.org.uk/programming/Framebuffer-HOWTO-1.3.html> for more
	  information.

	  Say Y here and to the driver for your graphics board below if you
	  are compiling a kernel for a non-x86 architecture.

	  If you are compiling for the x86 architecture, you can say Y if you
	  want to play with it, but it is not essential. Please note that
	  running graphical applications that directly touch the hardware
	  (e.g. an accelerated X server) and that are not frame buffer
	  device-aware may cause unexpected results. If unsure, say N.

config FIRMWARE_EDID

	  This enables access to the EDID transferred from the firmware.
	  On the i386, this is from the Video BIOS. Enable this if DDC/I2C
	  transfers do not work for your driver and if you are using
	  nvidiafb, i810fb or savagefb.

	  In general, choosing Y for this option is safe.  If you
	  experience extremely long delays while booting before you get
	  something on your display, try setting this to N.  Matrox cards in
	  combination with certain motherboards and monitors are known to
	  suffer from this problem.

config FB_TILEBLITTING
	bool "Enable Tile Blitting Support"
	depends on FB
	help
	  This enables tile blitting.  Tile blitting is a drawing technique
	  where the screen is divided into rectangular sections (tiles), whereas
	  the standard blitting divides the screen into pixels. Because the
	  default drawing element is a tile, drawing functions will be passed
	  parameters in terms of number of tiles instead of number of pixels.
	  For example, to draw a single character, instead of using bitmaps,
	  an index to an array of bitmaps will be used.  To clear or move a
	  rectangular section of a screen, the rectangle will be described in
	  terms of number of tiles in the x- and y-axis.

	  This is particularly important to one driver, matroxfb.  If
	  unsure, say N.

	  This is a `virtual' frame buffer device. It operates on a chunk of
	  unswappable kernel memory instead of on the memory of a graphics
	  board. This means you cannot see any output sent to this frame
	  buffer device, while it does consume precious memory. The main use
	  of this frame buffer device is testing and debugging the frame
	  buffer subsystem. Do NOT enable it for normal systems! To protect
	  the innocent, it has to be enabled explicitly at boot time using the
	  kernel option `video=vfb:'.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called vfb. In order to load it, you must use
	  the vfb_enable=1 option.

	  If unsure, say N.
