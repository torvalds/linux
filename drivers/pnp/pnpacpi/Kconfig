	  Linux uses the PNPACPI to autodetect built-in
	  mainboard resources (e.g. parallel port resources).

          Some features (e.g. real hotplug) are not currently
          implemented.

          If you would like the kernel to detect and allocate resources to
          your mainboard devices (on some systems they are disabled by the
          BIOS) say Y here.  Also the PNPACPI can help prevent resource
          conflicts between mainboard devices and other bus devices.
