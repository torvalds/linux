	  The Gunyah drivers are the helper interfaces that runs on the
	  virtual machines that provides support such as memory/device
	  sharing, IRQ sharing, IPC/signalling mechanisms, and so on.

	  Say Y here to enable the drivers needed to work on Gunyah
	  virtualization environment.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled.

config GH_DBL
	tristate "Gunyah Doorbell driver"
	help
	  Gunyah offers a simple inter VMs(Virtual Machines) communication
	  through the use of doorbell interrupts. A single doorbell instance
	  provides an unidirectional communication between two VMs and it acts
	  like either a source(Tx) or generate(Rx). Individual VMs make use of
	  these doorbells by calling send and/or a receive primitives exposed by
	  driver and trigger an interrupt to each other and exchange the data.

config GH_MSGQ
	tristate "Gunyah Message Queue driver"
	help
	  Gunyah offers message-queues as one of the IPC mechanisms to
	  communicate among the Virtual Machines. The message queue drivers
	  runs on the Virtual machines to provide an interface to the clients
	  who wish to communicate to other clients on a different VM. Currently,
	  the services offered by the drivers is simply to send and receive
	  messages in a blocking manner.
