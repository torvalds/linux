	  This is a driver for the Virtual Box Guest PCI device used in
	  Virtual Box virtual machines. Enabling this driver will add
	  support for Virtual Box Guest integration features such as
	  copy-and-paste, seamless mode and OpenGL pass-through.

	  This driver also offers vboxguest IPC functionality which is needed
	  for the vboxfs driver which offers folder sharing support.

	  If you enable this driver you should also enable the VBOXVIDEO option.

	  Although it is possible to build this module in, it is advised
	  to build this driver as a module, so that it can be updated
	  independently of the kernel. Select M to build this driver as a
	  module.
