          The Freescale hypervisor management driver provides several services
	  to drivers and applications related to the Freescale hypervisor:

          1) An ioctl interface for querying and managing partitions.

          2) A file interface to reading incoming doorbells.

          3) An interrupt handler for shutting down the partition upon
	     receiving the shutdown doorbell from a manager partition.

          4) A kernel interface for receiving callbacks when a managed
	     partition shuts down.

config JAILHOUSE_DBGCON
	tristate "Jailhouse console driver"
	depends on X86 || ARM || ARM64
	help
	  The Jailhouse hypervisor provides a simple write-only console for
	  debugging the bootstrap process of its cells. This driver registers
	  a console with the kernel to make use of it.

	  Note that Jailhouse has to be configured to permit a cell the usage
	  of the console interface.
