	  This is a driver for accessing the EFI secret area via securityfs.
	  The EFI secret area is a memory area designated by the firmware for
	  confidential computing secret injection (for example for AMD SEV
	  guests).  The driver exposes the secrets as files in
	  <securityfs>/secrets/coco.  Files can be read and deleted (deleting
	  a file wipes the secret from memory).

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.
	  The module will be called efi_secret.
