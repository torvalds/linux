config I8254
	tristate
	select COUNTER
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Enables support for the i8254 interface library functions. The i8254
	  interface library provides functions to facilitate communication with
	  interfaces compatible with the venerable Intel 8254 Programmable
	  Interval Timer (PIT). The Intel 825x family of chips was first
	  released in the early 1980s but compatible interfaces are nowadays
	  typically found embedded in larger VLSI processing chips and FPGA
	  components.

	  If built as a module its name will be i8254.

menuconfig COUNTER
	tristate "Counter support"
	help
	  This enables counter device support through the Generic Counter
	  interface. You only need to enable this, if you also want to enable
	  one or more of the counter device drivers below.

	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the ACCES 104-QUAD-8 quadrature
	  encoder counter/interface device family (104-QUAD-8, 104-QUAD-4).

	  A counter's respective error flag may be cleared by performing a write
	  operation on the respective count value attribute. The 104-QUAD-8
	  counters may be set either directly or via the counter's preset
	  attribute.

	  The base port addresses for the devices may be configured via the base
	  array module parameter. The interrupt line numbers for the devices may
	  be configured via the irq array module parameter.
