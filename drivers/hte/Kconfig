	  Hardware Timestamping Engine (HTE) Support.

	  Some devices provide a hardware timestamping engine which can
	  timestamp certain device lines/signals in realtime. It comes with a
	  benefit for the applications needing accurate timestamping event with
	  less jitter. This framework provides a generic interface to such HTE
	  providers and consumer devices.

	  If unsure, say no.

	  Enable this option for integrated hardware timestamping engine also
	  known as generic timestamping engine (GTE) support on NVIDIA Tegra194
	  systems-on-chip. The driver supports 352 LIC IRQs and 39 AON GPIOs
	  lines for timestamping in realtime.

	  The NVIDIA Tegra194 GTE test driver demonstrates how to use HTE
	  framework to timestamp GPIO and LIC IRQ lines.
