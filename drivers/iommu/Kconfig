	help
	  Trusted devices use translation to restrict their access to only
	  DMA-mapped pages, but with "lazy" batched TLB invalidation. This
	  mode allows higher performance with some IOMMUs due to reduced TLB
	  flushing, but at the cost of reduced isolation since devices may be
	  able to access memory for some time after it has been unmapped.
	  Equivalent to passing "iommu.passthrough=0 iommu.strict=0" on the
