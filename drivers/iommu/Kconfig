	  Say Y here if you want to compile device drivers for IO Memory
	  Management Units into the kernel. These devices usually allow to

	---help---
	  With this option you can enable support for AMD IOMMU hardware in
	  your system. An IOMMU is a hardware component which provides
	  remapping of DMA memory accesses from devices. With an AMD IOMMU you
	  can isolate the DMA memory of different devices and protect the
	  system from misbehaving device drivers or hardware.

	  You can find out if your system has an AMD IOMMU if you look into
	  your BIOS for an option to enable it or if you have an IVRS ACPI
	  table.

config AMD_IOMMU_STATS
	bool "Export AMD IOMMU statistics to debugfs"

	---help---
	  This option enables code in the AMD IOMMU driver to collect various
	  statistics about whats happening in the driver and exports that
	  information to userspace via debugfs.
	  If unsure, say N.

	  This option enables support for the AMD IOMMUv2 features of the IOMMU

	  the PCI PRI and PASID interface.

	  DMA remapping (DMAR) devices support enables independent address

	  be enabled by passing intel_iommu=on to the kernel.

config INTEL_IOMMU_BROKEN_GFX_WA
	bool "Workaround broken graphics drivers (going away soon)"
	depends on INTEL_IOMMU && BROKEN && X86
	---help---
	  Current Graphics drivers tend to use physical address
	  for DMA and avoid using DMA APIs. Setting this config
	  option permits the IOMMU driver to set a unity map for
	  all the OS-visible memory. Hence the driver can continue
	  to use physical addresses for DMA, at least until this
	  option is removed in the 2.6.32 kernel.

config INTEL_IOMMU_FLOPPY_WA
	def_bool y
	depends on INTEL_IOMMU && X86
	---help---
	  Floppy disk drivers are known to bypass DMA API calls
	  thereby failing to work when IOMMU is enabled. This
	  workaround will setup a 1:1 mapping for the first
	  16MiB to make floppy (an ISA device) work.
