	  Multiplexer controller subsystem. Multiplexers are used in a
	  variety of settings, and this subsystem abstracts their use
	  so that the rest of the kernel sees a common interface. When
	  multiple parallel multiplexers are controlled by one single
	  multiplexer controller, this subsystem also coordinates the
	  multiplexer accesses.

	  To compile the subsystem as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called mux-core.

	  ADG792A and ADG792G Wide Bandwidth Triple 4:1 Multiplexers

	  The driver supports both operating the three multiplexers in
	  parallel and operating them independently.

	  To compile the driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called mux-adg792a.

config MUX_GPIO
	tristate "GPIO-controlled Multiplexer"
	depends on GPIOLIB || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  GPIO-controlled Multiplexer controller.

	  The driver builds a single multiplexer controller using a number
	  of gpio pins. For N pins, there will be 2^N possible multiplexer
	  states. The GPIO pins can be connected (by the hardware) to several
	  multiplexers, which in that case will be operated in parallel.

	  To compile the driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called mux-gpio.
