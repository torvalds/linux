	  This driver lets you combine several hard disk partitions into one
	  logical block device. This can be used to simply append one
	  partition to another one or to combine several redundant hard disks
	  into a RAID1/4/5 device so as to provide protection against hard
	  disk failures. This is called "Software RAID" since the combining of
	  the partitions is done by the kernel. "Hardware RAID" means that the
	  combining is done by a dedicated controller; if you have such a
	  controller, you do not need to say Y here.

	  More information about Software RAID on Linux is contained in the

	help
	  If you say Y here, then the kernel will try to autodetect raid

	  If you don't use raid and say Y, this autodetection can cause

	  If unsure, say Y.

	help
	  If you say Y here, support for write intent bitmaps in files on an

	  will continue to use the operational mirrors in the set, providing
	  an error free MD (multiple device) to the higher levels of the

	  Unlike RAID-0, but like RAID-1, RAID-10 requires all devices to
