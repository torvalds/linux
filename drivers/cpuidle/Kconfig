	  CPU idle is a generic framework for supporting software-controlled
	  idle processor power management.  It includes modular cross-platform
	  governors that can be swapped during runtime.

	  If you're using an ACPI-enabled platform, you should say Y here.

config CPU_IDLE_GOV_TEO
	bool "Timer events oriented (TEO) governor (for tickless systems)"
	help
	  This governor implements a simplified idle state selection method
	  focused on timer events and does not do any interactivity boosting.

	  Some workloads benefit from using it and it generally should be safe
	  to use.  Say Y here if you are not happy with the alternatives.

config CPU_IDLE_GOV_HALTPOLL
	bool "Haltpoll governor (for virtualized systems)"
	depends on KVM_GUEST
	help
	  This governor implements haltpoll idle state selection, to be
	  used in conjunction with the haltpoll cpuidle driver, allowing
	  for polling for a certain amount of time before entering idle
	  state.

	  Some virtualized workloads benefit from using it.

    help
      This governor implements effective cpu and cluster idle state
      selection with help of scheduler inputs, cpu idle state prediction
      and cluster idle state prediction algorithms.

      The predicted sleep time, latency requirement for the
      CPU and the idle state chosen based on the parameters are all
      logged in the trace.

	depends on ARM_PSCI_CPUIDLE
	help
	  This governor allows the cpu and cluster to deeper idle states more aggressively
	  by reducing cpuidle parameters such as the entry, exit latencies and the residency.

	  This provides the provision to user to update cpuidle parameters so that it can
	  allow or restrict particular Idle state more aggressively.
