	  This is a generic driver that controls the power state of different
	  PCI slots. The voltage regulators powering the rails of the PCI slots
	  are expected to be defined in the devicetree node of the PCI bridge.

	  switch.

	  This driver enables power and configures the TC9563 PCIe switch
	  through i2c. TC9563 is a PCIe switch which has one upstream and three
	  downstream ports. To one of the downstream ports integrated ethernet
	  MAC is connected as endpoint device. Other two downstream ports are
	  supposed to connect to external device.
