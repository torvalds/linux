	help
	  Say Y here to enable PCIe controller support for Sigma Designs
	  Tango SMP8759-based systems.

	  Note: The SMP8759 controller multiplexes PCI config and MMIO
	  accesses, and Linux doesn't provide a way to serialize them.
	  This can lead to data corruption if drivers perform concurrent
	  config and MMIO accesses.

config VMD
	depends on PCI_MSI && X86_64 && SRCU
	tristate "Intel Volume Management Device Driver"
	---help---
	  Adds support for the Intel Volume Management Device (VMD). VMD is a
	  secondary PCI host bridge that allows PCI Express root ports,
	  and devices attached to them, to be removed from the default
	  PCI domain and placed within the VMD domain. This provides
	  more bus resources than are otherwise possible with a
	  single domain. If you know your system provides one of these and
	  has devices attached to it, say Y; if you are not sure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called vmd.
