	help
	   Enable this configuration option to support configurable PCI
	   endpoint. This should be enabled if the platform has a PCI
	   controller that can operate in endpoint mode.

	   Enabling this option will build the endpoint library, which
	   includes endpoint controller library and endpoint function
	   library.

	   If in doubt, say "N" to disable Endpoint support.
