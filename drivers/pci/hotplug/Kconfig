	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have a motherboard with a PCI Hotplug controller.
	  This allows you to add and remove PCI cards while the machine is
	  powered up and running.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called pci_hotplug.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config HOTPLUG_PCI_FAKE
	tristate "Fake PCI Hotplug driver"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use the fake PCI hotplug driver. It can
	  be used to simulate PCI hotplug events if even if your system is
	  not PCI hotplug capable.

	  This driver will "emulate" removing PCI devices from the system.
	  If the "power" file is written to with "0" then the specified PCI
	  device will be completely removed from the kernel.

	  WARNING, this does NOT turn off the power to the PCI device.
	  This is a "logical" removal, not a physical or electrical
	  removal.

	  Use this module at your own risk.  You have been warned!

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called fakephp.

	  When in doubt, say N.
