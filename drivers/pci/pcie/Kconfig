	  This enables OS control over PCI Express ASPM (Active State
	  Power Management) and Clock Power Management. ASPM supports
	  state L0/L0s/L1.

	  ASPM is initially set up by the firmware. With this option enabled,
	  Linux can modify this state in order to disable ASPM on known-bad
	  hardware or configurations and enable it when known-safe.

	  ASPM can be disabled or enabled at runtime via
	  /sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy

	  When in doubt, say Y.
