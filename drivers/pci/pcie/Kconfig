# PCI Express Port Bus Configuration

config PCIEPORTBUS
	bool "PCI Express Port Bus support"
	default y if USB4
	help
	  This enables PCI Express Port Bus support. Users can then enable
	  support for Native Hot-Plug, Advanced Error Reporting, Power
	  Management Events, and Downstream Port Containment.

# Include service Kconfig here

config HOTPLUG_PCI_PCIE
	bool "PCI Express Hotplug driver"
	depends on HOTPLUG_PCI && PCIEPORTBUS
	default y if USB4
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a motherboard that supports PCIe native
	  hotplug.

	  Thunderbolt/USB4 PCIe tunneling depends on native PCIe hotplug.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config PCIEAER
	bool "PCI Express Advanced Error Reporting support"
	depends on PCIEPORTBUS
	select RAS
	help
	  This enables PCI Express Root Port Advanced Error Reporting
	  (AER) driver support. Error reporting messages sent to Root
	  Port will be handled by PCI Express AER driver.

config PCIEAER_INJECT
	tristate "PCI Express error injection support"
	depends on PCIEAER
	select GENERIC_IRQ_INJECTION
	help
	  This enables PCI Express Root Port Advanced Error Reporting
	  (AER) software error injector.

	  Debugging AER code is quite difficult because it is hard
	  to trigger various real hardware errors. Software-based
	  error injection can fake almost all kinds of errors with the
	  help of a user space helper tool aer-inject, which can be
	  gotten from:
	     https://github.com/intel/aer-inject.git

config PCIEAER_CXL
	bool "PCI Express CXL RAS support"
	default y
	depends on PCIEAER && CXL_PCI
	help
	  Enables CXL error handling.

	  If unsure, say Y.

# PCI Express ECRC

config PCIE_ECRC
	bool "PCI Express ECRC settings control"
	depends on PCIEAER
	help
	  Used to override firmware/bios settings for PCI Express ECRC
	  (transaction layer end-to-end CRC checking).

	  When in doubt, say N.

#
# PCI Express ASPM
#
config PCIEASPM
	bool "PCI Express ASPM control" if EXPERT
	default y
	help
	  This enables OS control over PCI Express ASPM (Active State
	  Power Management) and Clock Power Management. ASPM supports
	  state L0/L0s/L1.

	  ASPM is initially set up by the firmware. With this option enabled,
	  Linux can modify this state in order to disable ASPM on known-bad
	  hardware or configurations and enable it when known-safe.

	  ASPM can be disabled or enabled at runtime via
	  /sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy

	  When in doubt, say Y.

config PCIEASPM_DEFAULT

	  Use the BIOS defaults for PCI Express ASPM.

config PCIEASPM_POWERSAVE
	bool "Powersave"

	  Enable PCI Express ASPM L0s and L1 where possible, even if the
	  BIOS did not.

config PCIEASPM_POWER_SUPERSAVE
	bool "Power Supersave"
	depends on PCIEASPM
	help
	  Same as PCIEASPM_POWERSAVE, except it also enables L1 substates where
	  possible. This would result in higher power savings while staying in L1
	  where the components support it.

config PCIEASPM_PERFORMANCE
	bool "Performance"
	depends on PCIEASPM
	help
	  Disable PCI Express ASPM L0s and L1, even if the BIOS enabled them.

config PCIE_DPC
	bool "PCI Express Downstream Port Containment support"
	depends on PCIEPORTBUS && PCIEAER
	help
	  This enables PCI Express Downstream Port Containment (DPC)
	  driver support.  DPC events from Root and Downstream ports
	  will be handled by the DPC driver.  If your system doesn't
	  have this capability or you do not want to use this feature,
	  it is safe to answer N.

config PCIE_PTM
	bool "PCI Express Precision Time Measurement support"
	help
	  This enables PCI Express Precision Time Measurement (PTM)
	  support.

	  This is only useful if you have devices that support PTM, but it
	  is safe to enable even if you don't.

config PCIE_EDR
	bool "PCI Express Error Disconnect Recover support"
	depends on PCIE_DPC && ACPI
	help
	  This option adds Error Disconnect Recover support as specified
	  in the Downstream Port Containment Related Enhancements ECN to
	  the PCI Firmware Specification r3.2.  Enable this if you want to
	  support hybrid DPC model which uses both firmware and OS to
	  implement DPC.
