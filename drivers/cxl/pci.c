 * DOC: cxl pci
 *
 * This implements the PCI exclusive functionality for a CXL device as it is
 * defined by the Compute Express Link specification. CXL devices may surface
 * certain functionality even if it isn't CXL enabled.
 *
 * The driver has several responsibilities, mainly:
 *  - Create the memX device and register on the CXL bus.
 *  - Enumerate device's register interface and map them.
 *  - Probe the device attributes to establish sysfs interface.
 *  - Provide an IOCTL interface to userspace to communicate with the device for
 *    things like firmware update.
