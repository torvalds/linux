config IEEE1394
	tristate "IEEE 1394 (FireWire) support"
	depends on PCI || BROKEN
	select NET
	help
	  IEEE 1394 describes a high performance serial bus, which is also
	  known as FireWire(tm) or i.Link(tm) and is used for connecting all
	  sorts of devices (most notably digital video cameras) to your
	  computer.

	  If you have FireWire hardware and want to use it, say Y here.  This
	  is the core support only, you will also need to select a driver for
	  your IEEE 1394 adapter.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the
	  module will be called ieee1394.

comment "Subsystem Options"
	depends on IEEE1394

config IEEE1394_VERBOSEDEBUG
	bool "Excessive debugging output"
	depends on IEEE1394
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will get very verbose debugging logs from
	  the subsystem which includes a dump of the header of every sent
	  and received packet.  This can amount to a high amount of data
	  collected in a very short time which is usually also saved to
	  disk by the system logging daemons.

	  Say Y if you really want or need the debugging output, everyone
	  else says N.

config IEEE1394_OUI_DB
	bool "OUI Database built-in"
	depends on IEEE1394
	help
	  If you say Y here, then an OUI list (vendor unique ID's) will be
	  compiled into the ieee1394 module. This doesn't really do much
	  except being able to display the vendor of a hardware node. The
	  downside is that it adds about 300k to the size of the module,
	  or kernel (depending on whether you compile ieee1394 as a
	  module, or static in the kernel).

	  This option is not needed for userspace programs like gscanbus
	  to show this information.

config IEEE1394_EXTRA_CONFIG_ROMS
	bool "Build in extra config rom entries for certain functionality"
	depends on IEEE1394
	help
	  Some IEEE1394 functionality depends on extra config rom entries
	  being available in the host adapters CSR. These options will
	  allow you to choose which ones.

config IEEE1394_CONFIG_ROM_IP1394
	bool "IP-1394 Entry"
	depends on IEEE1394_EXTRA_CONFIG_ROMS && IEEE1394
	help
	  Adds an entry for using IP-over-1394. If you want to use your
	  IEEE1394 bus as a network for IP systems (including interacting
	  with MacOSX and WinXP IP-over-1394), enable this option and the
	  eth1394 option below.

config IEEE1394_EXPORT_FULL_API
	bool "Export all symbols of ieee1394's API"
	depends on IEEE1394
	default n
	help
	  Export all symbols of ieee1394's driver programming interface, even
	  those that are not currently used by the standard IEEE 1394 drivers.

	  This option does not affect the interface to userspace applications.
	  Say Y here if you want to compile externally developed drivers that
	  make extended use of ieee1394's API. It is otherwise safe to say N.

config IEEE1394_PCILYNX
	tristate "Texas Instruments PCILynx support"
	depends on PCI && IEEE1394 && I2C
	select I2C_ALGOBIT
	help
	  Say Y here if you have an IEEE-1394 controller with the Texas
	  Instruments PCILynx chip.  Note: this driver is written for revision
	  2 of this chip and may not work with revision 0.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the
	  module will be called pcilynx.

config IEEE1394_OHCI1394
	tristate "OHCI-1394 support"
	depends on PCI && IEEE1394
	help
	  Enable this driver if you have an IEEE 1394 controller based on the
	  OHCI-1394 specification. The current driver is only tested with OHCI
	  chipsets made by Texas Instruments and NEC. Most third-party vendors
	  use one of these chipsets.  It should work with any OHCI-1394
	  compliant card, however.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the
	  module will be called ohci1394.

config IEEE1394_VIDEO1394
	tristate "OHCI-1394 Video support"
	depends on IEEE1394 && IEEE1394_OHCI1394
	help
	  This option enables video device usage for OHCI-1394 cards.  Enable
	  this option only if you have an IEEE 1394 video device connected to
	  an OHCI-1394 card.

config IEEE1394_SBP2
	tristate "SBP-2 support (Harddisks etc.)"
	depends on IEEE1394 && SCSI && (PCI || BROKEN)
	help
	  This option enables you to use SBP-2 devices connected to your IEEE
	  1394 bus.  SBP-2 devices include harddrives and DVD devices.

config IEEE1394_SBP2_PHYS_DMA
	bool "Enable Phys DMA support for SBP2 (Debug)"

	depends on IEEE1394 && EXPERIMENTAL && INET
	select IEEE1394_CONFIG_ROM_IP1394
	select IEEE1394_EXTRA_CONFIG_ROMS
	help
	  This driver implements a functional majority of RFC 2734: IPv4 over
	  1394.  It will provide IP connectivity with implementations of RFC
	  2734 found on other operating systems.  It will not communicate with
	  older versions of this driver found in stock kernels prior to 2.6.3.
	  This driver is still considered experimental.  It does not yet support
	  MCAP, therefore multicast support is significantly limited.

config IEEE1394_DV1394
	tristate "OHCI-DV I/O support"
	depends on IEEE1394 && IEEE1394_OHCI1394
	help
	  This driver allows you to transmit and receive DV (digital video)
	  streams on an OHCI-1394 card using a simple frame-oriented
	  interface.

	  The user-space API for dv1394 is documented in dv1394.h.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the
	  module will be called dv1394.

config IEEE1394_RAWIO
	tristate "Raw IEEE1394 I/O support"
	depends on IEEE1394
	help
	  Say Y here if you want support for the raw device. This is generally
	  a good idea, so you should say Y here. The raw device enables
	  direct communication of user programs with the IEEE 1394 bus and
	  thus with the attached peripherals.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the
	  module will be called raw1394.

config IEEE1394_CMP
	tristate "IEC61883-1 Plug support"
	depends on IEEE1394
	help
	  This option enables the Connection Management Procedures
	  (IEC61883-1) driver, which implements input and output plugs.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the
	  module will be called cmp.

config IEEE1394_AMDTP
	tristate "IEC61883-6 (Audio transmission) support"
	depends on IEEE1394 && IEEE1394_OHCI1394 && IEEE1394_CMP
	help
	  This option enables the Audio & Music Data Transmission Protocol
	  (IEC61883-6) driver, which implements audio transmission over
	  IEEE1394.

	  The userspace interface is documented in amdtp.h.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the
	  module will be called amdtp.
