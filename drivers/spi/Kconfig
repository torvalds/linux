menuconfig SPI
	bool "SPI support"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  The "Serial Peripheral Interface" is a low level synchronous
	  protocol.  Chips that support SPI can have data transfer rates
	  up to several tens of Mbit/sec.  Chips are addressed with a
	  controller and a chipselect.  Most SPI slaves don't support
	  dynamic device discovery; some are even write-only or read-only.

	  SPI is widely used by microcontrollers to talk with sensors,
	  eeprom and flash memory, codecs and various other controller
	  chips, analog to digital (and d-to-a) converters, and more.
	  MMC and SD cards can be accessed using SPI protocol; and for
	  DataFlash cards used in MMC sockets, SPI must always be used.

	  SPI is one of a family of similar protocols using a four wire
	  interface (select, clock, data in, data out) including Microwire
	  (half duplex), SSP, SSI, and PSP.  This driver framework should
	  work with most such devices and controllers.

	  If your system has an master-capable SPI controller (which
	  provides the clock and chipselect), you can enable that
	  controller and the protocol drivers for the SPI slave chips
	  that are connected.

	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  Au1550 SPI controller (may also work with Au1200,Au1210,Au1250).

config SPI_BITBANG
	tristate "Bitbanging SPI master"
	depends on SPI_MASTER && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  With a few GPIO pins, your system can bitbang the SPI protocol.
	  Select this to get SPI support through I/O pins (GPIO, parallel
	  port, etc).  Or, some systems' SPI master controller drivers use
	  this code to manage the per-word or per-transfer accesses to the
	  hardware shift registers.

	  This is library code, and is automatically selected by drivers that
	  need it.  You only need to select this explicitly to support driver
	  modules that aren't part of this kernel tree.

	  controllers in master mode.

	  Note, this driver uniquely supports the SPI controller on the MPC83xx
	  family of PowerPC processors, plus processors with QUICC Engine
	  technology. This driver uses a simple set of shift registers for data
