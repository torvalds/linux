	bool "SPI support"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  The "Serial Peripheral Interface" is a low level synchronous
	  protocol.  Chips that support SPI can have data transfer rates
	  up to several tens of Mbit/sec.  Chips are addressed with a
	  controller and a chipselect.  Most SPI slaves don't support
	  dynamic device discovery; some are even write-only or read-only.

	  SPI is widely used by microcontrollers to talk with sensors,
	  eeprom and flash memory, codecs and various other controller
	  chips, analog to digital (and d-to-a) converters, and more.
	  MMC and SD cards can be accessed using SPI protocol; and for
	  DataFlash cards used in MMC sockets, SPI must always be used.

	  SPI is one of a family of similar protocols using a four wire
	  interface (select, clock, data in, data out) including Microwire
	  (half duplex), SSP, SSI, and PSP.  This driver framework should
	  work with most such devices and controllers.
