menuconfig SPI
	bool "SPI support"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  The "Serial Peripheral Interface" is a low level synchronous
	  protocol.  Chips that support SPI can have data transfer rates
	  up to several tens of Mbit/sec.  Chips are addressed with a
	  controller and a chipselect.  Most SPI slaves don't support
	  dynamic device discovery; some are even write-only or read-only.

	  SPI is widely used by microcontrollers to talk with sensors,
	  eeprom and flash memory, codecs and various other controller
	  chips, analog to digital (and d-to-a) converters, and more.
	  MMC and SD cards can be accessed using SPI protocol; and for
	  DataFlash cards used in MMC sockets, SPI must always be used.

	  SPI is one of a family of similar protocols using a four wire
	  interface (select, clock, data in, data out) including Microwire
	  (half duplex), SSP, SSI, and PSP.  This driver framework should
	  work with most such devices and controllers.

	  With a few GPIO pins, your system can bitbang the SPI protocol.
	  Select this to get SPI support through I/O pins (GPIO, parallel
	  port, etc).  Or, some systems' SPI master controller drivers use
	  this code to manage the per-word or per-transfer accesses to the
	  hardware shift registers.

	  This is library code, and is automatically selected by drivers that
	  need it.  You only need to select this explicitly to support driver
	  modules that aren't part of this kernel tree.

	  slaves connected to a bus using this driver are configured as usual,
	  except that the spi_board_info.controller_data holds the GPIO number
	  for the chipselect used by this controller driver.

	  Note that this driver often won't achieve even 1 Mbit/sec speeds,

	  GPIO operations, you should be able to leverage that for better
	  speed with a custom version of this driver; see the source code.
