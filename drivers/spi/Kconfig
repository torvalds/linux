config SPI
	bool "SPI support"
	help
	  The "Serial Peripheral Interface" is a low level synchronous
	  protocol.  Chips that support SPI can have data transfer rates
	  up to several tens of Mbit/sec.  Chips are addressed with a
	  controller and a chipselect.  Most SPI slaves don't support
	  dynamic device discovery; some are even write-only or read-only.

	  SPI is widely used by microcontollers to talk with sensors,
	  eeprom and flash memory, codecs and various other controller
	  chips, analog to digital (and d-to-a) converters, and more.
	  MMC and SD cards can be accessed using SPI protocol; and for
	  DataFlash cards used in MMC sockets, SPI must always be used.

	  SPI is one of a family of similar protocols using a four wire
	  interface (select, clock, data in, data out) including Microwire
	  (half duplex), SSP, SSI, and PSP.  This driver framework should
	  work with most such devices and controllers.

config SPI_DEBUG
	boolean "Debug support for SPI drivers"
	depends on SPI && DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say "yes" to enable debug messaging (like dev_dbg and pr_debug),
	  sysfs, and debugfs support in SPI controller and protocol drivers.

config SPI_MASTER
#	boolean "SPI Master Support"
	boolean
	default SPI
	help
	  If your system has an master-capable SPI controller (which
	  provides the clock and chipselect), you can enable that
	  controller and the protocol drivers for the SPI slave chips
	  that are connected.

config SPI_BITBANG
	tristate "Bitbanging SPI master"
	depends on SPI_MASTER && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  With a few GPIO pins, your system can bitbang the SPI protocol.
	  Select this to get SPI support through I/O pins (GPIO, parallel
	  port, etc).  Or, some systems' SPI master controller drivers use
	  this code to manage the per-word or per-transfer accesses to the
	  hardware shift registers.

	  This is library code, and is automatically selected by drivers that
	  need it.  You only need to select this explicitly to support driver
	  modules that aren't part of this kernel tree.

config SPI_BUTTERFLY

	select SPI_BITBANG
	help
	  This uses a custom parallel port cable to connect to an AVR
	  Butterfly <http://www.atmel.com/products/avr/butterfly>, an
	  inexpensive battery powered microcontroller evaluation board.
	  This same cable can be used to flash new firmware.
