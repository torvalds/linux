	bool "Enable GPMC debug output and skip reset of GPMC during init"
	depends on OMAP_GPMC
	help
	  Enables verbose debugging mostly to decode the bootloader provided
	  timings. To preserve the bootloader provided timings, the reset
	  of GPMC is skipped during init. Enable this during development to
	  configure devices connected to the GPMC bus.

	  NOTE: In addition to matching the register setup with the bootloader
	  you also need to match the GPMC FCLK frequency used by the
	  bootloader or else the GPMC timings won't be identical with the
	  bootloader timings.
