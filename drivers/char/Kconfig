	bool "/dev/kmem virtual device support"
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support the /dev/kmem device. The

	  kind of kernel debugging operations.
	  When in doubt, say "N".

config STALDRV
	bool "Stallion multiport serial support"
	depends on SERIAL_NONSTANDARD
	help
	  Stallion cards give you many serial ports.  You would need something
	  like this to connect more than two modems to your Linux box, for
	  instance in order to become a dial-in server.  If you say Y here,
	  you will be asked for your specific card model in the next
	  questions.  Make sure to read <file:Documentation/serial/stallion.txt>
	  in this case.  If you have never heard about all this, it's safe to
	  say N.

config SGI_SNSC

	depends on EXPERT
	default n
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, the support for writing user messages (i.e.
	  console messages) via printk is available.

	  The feature is useful to inline user messages with kernel
	  messages.
	  In order to use this feature, you should output user messages
	  to /dev/ttyprintk or redirect console to this TTY.

	  If unsure, say N.

config BRIQ_PANEL
	tristate 'Total Impact briQ front panel driver'
	depends on PPC_CHRP
	---help---
	  The briQ is a small footprint CHRP computer with a frontpanel VFD, a
	  tristate led and two switches. It is the size of a CDROM drive.

	  If you have such one and want anything showing on the VFD then you
	  must answer Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called briq_panel.

	  It's safe to say N here.

config BFIN_OTP
	tristate "Blackfin On-Chip OTP Memory Support"
	depends on BLACKFIN && (BF51x || BF52x || BF54x)
	default y
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will get support for a character device
	  interface into the One Time Programmable memory pages that are
	  stored on the Blackfin processor.  This will not get you access
	  to the secure memory pages however.  You will need to write your
	  own secure code and reader for that.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called bfin-otp.

	  If unsure, it is safe to say Y.

config BFIN_OTP_WRITE_ENABLE
	bool "Enable writing support of OTP pages"
	depends on BFIN_OTP
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will enable support for writing of the
	  OTP pages.  This is dangerous by nature as you can only program
	  the pages once, so only enable this option when you actually
	  need it so as to not inadvertently clobber data.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PRINTER
	tristate "Parallel printer support"
	depends on PARPORT
	---help---
	  If you intend to attach a printer to the parallel port of your Linux
	  box (as opposed to using a serial printer; if the connector at the
	  printer has 9 or 25 holes ["female"], then it's serial), say Y.
	  Also read the Printing-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  It is possible to share one parallel port among several devices
	  (e.g. printer and ZIP drive) and it is safe to compile the
	  corresponding drivers into the kernel.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/parport.txt>.  The module will be called lp.

	  If you have several parallel ports, you can specify which ports to
	  use with the "lp" kernel command line option.  (Try "man bootparam"
	  or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about
	  how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  The syntax of the
	  "lp" command line option can be found in <file:drivers/char/lp.c>.

	  If you have more than 8 printers, you need to increase the LP_NO
	  macro in lp.c and the PARPORT_MAX macro in parport.h.

config LP_CONSOLE
	bool "Support for console on line printer"
	depends on PRINTER
	---help---
	  If you want kernel messages to be printed out as they occur, you
	  can have a console on the printer. This option adds support for
	  doing that; to actually get it to happen you need to pass the
	  option "console=lp0" to the kernel at boot time.

	  If the printer is out of paper (or off, or unplugged, or too
	  busy..) the kernel will stall until the printer is ready again.
	  By defining CONSOLE_LP_STRICT to 0 (at your own risk) you
	  can make the kernel continue when this happens,
	  but it'll lose the kernel messages.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PPDEV
	tristate "Support for user-space parallel port device drivers"
	depends on PARPORT
	---help---
	  Saying Y to this adds support for /dev/parport device nodes.  This
	  is needed for programs that want portable access to the parallel
	  port, for instance deviceid (which displays Plug-and-Play device
	  IDs).

	  This is the parallel port equivalent of SCSI generic support (sg).
	  It is safe to say N to this -- it is not needed for normal printing
	  or parallel port CD-ROM/disk support.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ppdev.

	  If unsure, say N.

source "drivers/tty/hvc/Kconfig"

config VIRTIO_CONSOLE
	tristate "Virtio console"
	depends on VIRTIO
	select HVC_DRIVER
	help
	  Virtio console for use with lguest and other hypervisors.

	  Also serves as a general-purpose serial device for data
	  transfer between the guest and host.  Character devices at
	  /dev/vportNpn will be created when corresponding ports are
	  found, where N is the device number and n is the port number
	  within that device.  If specified by the host, a sysfs
	  attribute called 'name' will be populated with a name for
	  the port which can be used by udev scripts to create a
	  symlink to the device.

config IBM_BSR
	tristate "IBM POWER Barrier Synchronization Register support"
	depends on PPC_PSERIES
	help
	  This devices exposes a hardware mechanism for fast synchronization
	  of threads across a large system which avoids bouncing a cacheline
	  between several cores on a system

source "drivers/char/ipmi/Kconfig"

config DS1620
	tristate "NetWinder thermometer support"
	depends on ARCH_NETWINDER
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for the thermal management hardware
	  found in the NetWinder. This driver allows the user to control the
	  temperature set points and to read the current temperature.

	  It is also possible to say M here to build it as a module (ds1620)
	  It is recommended to be used on a NetWinder, but it is not a
	  necessity.

config NWBUTTON
	tristate "NetWinder Button"
	depends on ARCH_NETWINDER
	---help---
	  If you say Y here and create a character device node /dev/nwbutton
	  with major and minor numbers 10 and 158 ("man mknod"), then every
	  time the orange button is pressed a number of times, the number of
	  times the button was pressed will be written to that device.

	  This is most useful for applications, as yet unwritten, which
	  perform actions based on how many times the button is pressed in a
	  row.

	  Do not hold the button down for too long, as the driver does not
	  alter the behaviour of the hardware reset circuitry attached to the
	  button; it will still execute a hard reset if the button is held
	  down for longer than approximately five seconds.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nwbutton.

	  Most people will answer Y to this question and "Reboot Using Button"
	  below to be able to initiate a system shutdown from the button.

config NWBUTTON_REBOOT
	bool "Reboot Using Button"
	depends on NWBUTTON
	help
	  If you say Y here, then you will be able to initiate a system
	  shutdown and reboot by pressing the orange button a number of times.
	  The number of presses to initiate the shutdown is two by default,
	  but this can be altered by modifying the value of NUM_PRESSES_REBOOT
	  in nwbutton.h and recompiling the driver or, if you compile the
	  driver as a module, you can specify the number of presses at load
	  time with "insmod button reboot_count=<something>".

config NWFLASH
	tristate "NetWinder flash support"
	depends on ARCH_NETWINDER
	---help---
	  If you say Y here and create a character device /dev/flash with
	  major 10 and minor 160 you can manipulate the flash ROM containing
	  the NetWinder firmware. Be careful as accidentally overwriting the
	  flash contents can render your computer unbootable. On no account
	  allow random users access to this device. :-)

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nwflash.

	  If you're not sure, say N.

config NVRAM
	tristate "/dev/nvram support"
	depends on ATARI || X86 || (ARM && RTC_DRV_CMOS) || GENERIC_NVRAM
	---help---
	  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/nvram
	  with major number 10 and minor number 144 using mknod ("man mknod"),
	  you get read and write access to the extra bytes of non-volatile
	  memory in the real time clock (RTC), which is contained in every PC
	  and most Ataris.  The actual number of bytes varies, depending on the
	  nvram in the system, but is usually 114 (128-14 for the RTC).

	  This memory is conventionally called "CMOS RAM" on PCs and "NVRAM"
	  on Ataris. /dev/nvram may be used to view settings there, or to
	  change them (with some utility). It could also be used to frequently
	  save a few bits of very important data that may not be lost over
	  power-off and for which writing to disk is too insecure. Note
	  however that most NVRAM space in a PC belongs to the BIOS and you
	  should NEVER idly tamper with it. See Ralf Brown's interrupt list
	  for a guide to the use of CMOS bytes by your BIOS.

	  On Atari machines, /dev/nvram is always configured and does not need
	  to be selected.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nvram.
