config TTY_PRINTK
	tristate "TTY driver to output user messages via printk"
	depends on EXPERT && TTY
	default n
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, the support for writing user messages (i.e.
	  console messages) via printk is available.

	  The feature is useful to inline user messages with kernel
	  messages.
	  In order to use this feature, you should output user messages
	  to /dev/ttyprintk or redirect console to this TTY.

	  If unsure, say N.

config TTY_PRINTK_LEVEL
	depends on TTY_PRINTK
	int "ttyprintk log level (1-7)"
	range 1 7
	default "6"
	help
	  Printk log level to use for ttyprintk messages.

config PRINTER
	tristate "Parallel printer support"
	depends on PARPORT
	---help---
	  If you intend to attach a printer to the parallel port of your Linux
	  box (as opposed to using a serial printer; if the connector at the
	  printer has 9 or 25 holes ["female"], then it's serial), say Y.
	  Also read the Printing-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  It is possible to share one parallel port among several devices
	  (e.g. printer and ZIP drive) and it is safe to compile the
	  corresponding drivers into the kernel.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/admin-guide/parport.rst>.  The module will be called lp.

	  If you have several parallel ports, you can specify which ports to
	  use with the "lp" kernel command line option.  (Try "man bootparam"
	  or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about
	  how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  The syntax of the
	  "lp" command line option can be found in <file:drivers/char/lp.c>.

	  If you have more than 8 printers, you need to increase the LP_NO
	  macro in lp.c and the PARPORT_MAX macro in parport.h.

config LP_CONSOLE
	bool "Support for console on line printer"
	depends on PRINTER
	---help---
	  If you want kernel messages to be printed out as they occur, you
	  can have a console on the printer. This option adds support for
	  doing that; to actually get it to happen you need to pass the
	  option "console=lp0" to the kernel at boot time.

	  If the printer is out of paper (or off, or unplugged, or too
	  busy..) the kernel will stall until the printer is ready again.
	  By defining CONSOLE_LP_STRICT to 0 (at your own risk) you
	  can make the kernel continue when this happens,
	  but it'll lose the kernel messages.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PPDEV
	tristate "Support for user-space parallel port device drivers"
	depends on PARPORT
	---help---
	  Saying Y to this adds support for /dev/parport device nodes.  This
	  is needed for programs that want portable access to the parallel
	  port, for instance deviceid (which displays Plug-and-Play device
	  IDs).

	  This is the parallel port equivalent of SCSI generic support (sg).
	  It is safe to say N to this -- it is not needed for normal printing
	  or parallel port CD-ROM/disk support.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ppdev.

	  If unsure, say N.

config VIRTIO_CONSOLE
	tristate "Virtio console"
	depends on VIRTIO && TTY
	select HVC_DRIVER
	help
	  Virtio console for use with hypervisors.

	  Also serves as a general-purpose serial device for data
	  transfer between the guest and host.  Character devices at
	  /dev/vportNpn will be created when corresponding ports are
	  found, where N is the device number and n is the port number
	  within that device.  If specified by the host, a sysfs
	  attribute called 'name' will be populated with a name for
	  the port which can be used by udev scripts to create a
	  symlink to the device.

config IBM_BSR
	tristate "IBM POWER Barrier Synchronization Register support"
	depends on PPC_PSERIES
	help
	  This devices exposes a hardware mechanism for fast synchronization
	  of threads across a large system which avoids bouncing a cacheline
	  between several cores on a system

config POWERNV_OP_PANEL
	tristate "IBM POWERNV Operator Panel Display support"
	depends on PPC_POWERNV
	default m
	help
	  If you say Y here, a special character device node, /dev/op_panel,
	  will be created which exposes the operator panel display on IBM
	  Power Systems machines with FSPs.

	  If you don't require access to the operator panel display from user
	  space, say N.

	  If unsure, say M here to build it as a module called powernv-op-panel.

config DS1620
	tristate "NetWinder thermometer support"
	depends on ARCH_NETWINDER
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for the thermal management hardware
	  found in the NetWinder. This driver allows the user to control the
	  temperature set points and to read the current temperature.

	  It is also possible to say M here to build it as a module (ds1620)
	  It is recommended to be used on a NetWinder, but it is not a
	  necessity.

config NWBUTTON
	tristate "NetWinder Button"
	depends on ARCH_NETWINDER
	---help---
	  If you say Y here and create a character device node /dev/nwbutton
	  with major and minor numbers 10 and 158 ("man mknod"), then every
	  time the orange button is pressed a number of times, the number of
	  times the button was pressed will be written to that device.

	  This is most useful for applications, as yet unwritten, which
	  perform actions based on how many times the button is pressed in a
	  row.

	  Do not hold the button down for too long, as the driver does not
	  alter the behaviour of the hardware reset circuitry attached to the
	  button; it will still execute a hard reset if the button is held
	  down for longer than approximately five seconds.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nwbutton.

	  Most people will answer Y to this question and "Reboot Using Button"
	  below to be able to initiate a system shutdown from the button.

config NWBUTTON_REBOOT
	bool "Reboot Using Button"
	depends on NWBUTTON
	help
	  If you say Y here, then you will be able to initiate a system
	  shutdown and reboot by pressing the orange button a number of times.
	  The number of presses to initiate the shutdown is two by default,
	  but this can be altered by modifying the value of NUM_PRESSES_REBOOT
	  in nwbutton.h and recompiling the driver or, if you compile the
	  driver as a module, you can specify the number of presses at load
	  time with "insmod button reboot_count=<something>".

config NWFLASH
	tristate "NetWinder flash support"
	depends on ARCH_NETWINDER
	---help---
	  If you say Y here and create a character device /dev/flash with
	  major 10 and minor 160 you can manipulate the flash ROM containing
	  the NetWinder firmware. Be careful as accidentally overwriting the
	  flash contents can render your computer unbootable. On no account
	  allow random users access to this device. :-)

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nwflash.

	  If you're not sure, say N.

	help
	  This driver is for the DoubleTalk PC, a speech synthesizer
	  manufactured by RC Systems (<http://www.rcsys.com/>).  It is also
	  called the `internal DoubleTalk'.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	  This option enables support for Xilinx Internal Configuration
	  Access Port (ICAP) driver.  The ICAP is used on Xilinx Virtex
	  FPGA platforms to partially reconfigure the FPGA at runtime.

	  If unsure, say N.

config R3964
	tristate "Siemens R3964 line discipline"
	depends on TTY && BROKEN
	---help---
	  This driver allows synchronous communication with devices using the
	  Siemens R3964 packet protocol. Unless you are dealing with special
	  hardware like PLCs, you are unlikely to need this.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called n_r3964.

	  If unsure, say N.

config APPLICOM
	tristate "Applicom intelligent fieldbus card support"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  This driver provides the kernel-side support for the intelligent
	  fieldbus cards made by Applicom International. More information
	  about these cards can be found on the WWW at the address
	  <http://www.applicom-int.com/>, or by email from David Woodhouse
	  <dwmw2@infradead.org>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	  If unsure, say N.

config SONYPI
	tristate "Sony Vaio Programmable I/O Control Device support"
	depends on X86_32 && PCI && INPUT
	---help---
	  This driver enables access to the Sony Programmable I/O Control
	  Device which can be found in many (all ?) Sony Vaio laptops.

	  If you have one of those laptops, read
	  <file:Documentation/admin-guide/laptops/sonypi.rst>, and say Y or M here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called sonypi.

config MWAVE
	tristate "ACP Modem (Mwave) support"
	depends on X86 && TTY
	select SERIAL_8250
	---help---
	  The ACP modem (Mwave) for Linux is a WinModem. It is composed of a
	  kernel driver and a user level application. Together these components
	  support direct attachment to public switched telephone networks (PSTNs)
	  and support selected world wide countries.

	  This version of the ACP Modem driver supports the IBM Thinkpad 600E,
	  600, and 770 that include on board ACP modem hardware.

	  The modem also supports the standard communications port interface
	  (ttySx) and is compatible with the Hayes AT Command Set.

	  The user level application needed to use this driver can be found at
	  the IBM Linux Technology Center (LTC) web site:
	  <http://www.ibm.com/linux/ltc/>.

	  If you own one of the above IBM Thinkpads which has the Mwave chipset
	  in it, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

config DEVMEM
	bool "/dev/mem virtual device support"
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support the /dev/mem device.
	  The /dev/mem device is used to access areas of physical

	---help---
	  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/nvram
	  with major number 10 and minor number 144 using mknod ("man mknod"),
	  you get read and write access to the non-volatile memory.

	  /dev/nvram may be used to view settings in NVRAM or to change them
	  (with some utility). It could also be used to frequently
	  save a few bits of very important data that may not be lost over
	  power-off and for which writing to disk is too insecure. Note
	  however that most NVRAM space in a PC belongs to the BIOS and you
	  should NEVER idly tamper with it. See Ralf Brown's interrupt list
	  for a guide to the use of CMOS bytes by your BIOS.

	  This memory is conventionally called "NVRAM" on PowerPC machines,
	  "CMOS RAM" on PCs, "NVRAM" on Ataris and "PRAM" on Macintoshes.
