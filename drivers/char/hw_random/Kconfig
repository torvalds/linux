menuconfig HW_RANDOM
	tristate "Hardware Random Number Generator Core support"
	default m
	---help---
	  Hardware Random Number Generator Core infrastructure.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rng-core.  This provides a device
	  that's usually called /dev/hw_random, and which exposes one
	  of possibly several hardware random number generators.

	  These hardware random number generators do not feed directly
	  into the kernel's random number generator.  That is usually
	  handled by the "rngd" daemon.  Documentation/hw_random.txt
	  has more information.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config UML_RANDOM
	depends on UML
	tristate "Hardware random number generator"
	help
	  This option enables UML's "hardware" random number generator.  It
	  attaches itself to the host's /dev/random, supplying as much entropy
	  as the host has, rather than the small amount the UML gets from its
	  own drivers.  It registers itself as a standard hardware random number
	  generator, major 10, minor 183, and the canonical device name is
	  /dev/hwrng.
	  The way to make use of this is to install the rng-tools package
	  (check your distro, or download from
	  http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/).  rngd periodically reads
	  /dev/hwrng and injects the entropy into /dev/random.
