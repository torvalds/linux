config IPMI_HANDLER
       tristate 'IPMI top-level message handler'
       help
         This enables the central IPMI message handler, required for IPMI
	 to work.

         IPMI is a standard for managing sensors (temperature,
         voltage, etc.) in a system.

         See <file:Documentation/IPMI.txt> for more details on the driver.

	 If unsure, say N.

config IPMI_PANIC_EVENT
       bool 'Generate a panic event to all BMCs on a panic'
       depends on IPMI_HANDLER
       help
         When a panic occurs, this will cause the IPMI message handler to
	 generate an IPMI event describing the panic to each interface
	 registered with the message handler.

config IPMI_PANIC_STRING
	bool 'Generate OEM events containing the panic string'
	depends on IPMI_PANIC_EVENT
	help
	  When a panic occurs, this will cause the IPMI message handler to
	  generate IPMI OEM type f0 events holding the IPMB address of the
	  panic generator (byte 4 of the event), a sequence number for the
	  string (byte 5 of the event) and part of the string (the rest of the
	  event).  Bytes 1, 2, and 3 are the normal usage for an OEM event.
	  You can fetch these events and use the sequence numbers to piece the
	  string together.

config IPMI_DEVICE_INTERFACE
       tristate 'Device interface for IPMI'
       depends on IPMI_HANDLER
       help
         This provides an IOCTL interface to the IPMI message handler so
	 userland processes may use IPMI.  It supports poll() and select().

config IPMI_SI
       tristate 'IPMI System Interface handler'
       depends on IPMI_HANDLER
       help
         Provides a driver for System Interfaces (KCS, SMIC, BT).
	 Currently, only KCS and SMIC are supported.  If
	 you are using IPMI, you should probably say "y" here.

config IPMI_WATCHDOG
       tristate 'IPMI Watchdog Timer'
       depends on IPMI_HANDLER
       help
         This enables the IPMI watchdog timer.

config IPMI_POWEROFF
       tristate 'IPMI Poweroff'
       depends on IPMI_HANDLER
       help
         This enables a function to power off the system with IPMI if
	 the IPMI management controller is capable of this.
