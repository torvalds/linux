	tristate
	---help---
	  STMicroelectronics NFC NCI chips core driver. It implements the chipset
	  NCI logic and hooks into the NFC kernel APIs. Physical layers will
	  register against it.

config NFC_ST_NCI_I2C
	tristate "STMicroelectronics ST NCI NFC driver (I2C)"
	depends on NFC_NCI && I2C
	select NFC_ST_NCI
	---help---
	  This module adds support for an I2C interface to the
	  STMicroelectronics NFC NCI chips family.
	  Select this if your platform is using the i2c bus.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called st-nci_i2c.
	  Say N if unsure.

config NFC_ST_NCI_SPI
	tristate "STMicroelectronics ST NCI NFC driver (SPI)"
	depends on NFC_NCI && SPI
	select NFC_ST_NCI
	---help---
	  This module adds support for an SPI interface to the
	  STMicroelectronics NFC NCI chips family.
	  Select this if your platform is using the spi bus.

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called st-nci_spi.
	  Say N if unsure.
