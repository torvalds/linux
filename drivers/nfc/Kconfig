	depends on USB
	help
	  NXP PN533 USB driver.
	  This driver provides support for NFC NXP PN533 devices.

	  Say Y here to compile support for PN533 devices into the
	  kernel or say M to compile it as module (pn533).

config NFC_WILINK
	tristate "Texas Instruments NFC WiLink driver"
	depends on TI_ST && NFC_NCI
	help
	  This enables the NFC driver for Texas Instrument's BT/FM/GPS/NFC
	  combo devices. This makes use of shared transport line discipline
	  core driver to communicate with the NFC core of the combo chip.

	  Say Y here to compile support for Texas Instrument's NFC WiLink driver

config NFC_MEI_PHY
	tristate "MEI bus NFC device support"
	depends on INTEL_MEI && NFC_HCI
	help
	  This adds support to use an mei bus nfc device. Select this if you
	  will use an HCI NFC driver for an NFC chip connected behind an
	  Intel's Management Engine chip.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFC_SIM
	tristate "NFC hardware simulator driver"
	help
	  This driver declares two virtual NFC devices supporting NFC-DEP
	  protocol. An LLCP connection can be established between them and
