	default n
	---help---
	  Generic core driver for NXP NCI chips such as the NPC100
	  or PN7150 families.
	  This is a driver based on the NCI NFC kernel layers and
	  will thus not work with NXP libnfc library.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose m here. The module will
	  be called nxp_nci.
	  Say N if unsure.

	  be called nxp_nci_i2c.
