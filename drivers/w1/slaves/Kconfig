	tristate "Simple 64bit memory family implementation"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to connect 1-wire
	  simple 64bit memory rom(ds2401/ds2411/ds1990*) to your wire.

config W1_SLAVE_DS2405
	tristate "DS2405 Addressable Switch"
	help
	  Say Y or M here if you want to use a DS2405 1-wire
	  single-channel addressable switch.
	  This device can also work as a single-channel
	  binary remote sensor.

config W1_SLAVE_DS2408_READBACK
	bool "Read-back values written to DS2408's output register"
	depends on W1_SLAVE_DS2408
	default y
	help
	  Enabling this will cause the driver to read back the values written
	  to the chip's output register in order to detect errors.

	  This is slower but useful when debugging chips and/or busses.

config W1_SLAVE_DS2413
	tristate "Dual Channel Addressable Switch 0x3a family support (DS2413)"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use a 1-wire
	  DS2413 Dual Channel Addressable Switch device support

config W1_SLAVE_DS2406
	tristate "Dual Channel Addressable Switch 0x12 family support (DS2406)"
	select CRC16
	help
	  Say Y or M here if you want to use a 1-wire
	  DS2406 Dual Channel Addressable Switch.  EPROM read/write
	  support for these devices is not implemented.

config W1_SLAVE_DS2423
	tristate "Counter 1-wire device (DS2423)"
	select CRC16
	help
	  If you enable this you can read the counter values available
	  in the DS2423 chipset from the w1_slave file under the
	  sys file system.

	  Say Y here if you want to use a 1-wire
	  counter family device (DS2423).

	tristate "1kb EEPROM family support (DS2431)"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use a 1-wire
	  1kb EEPROM family device (DS2431)

config W1_SLAVE_DS2433
	tristate "4kb EEPROM family support (DS2433)"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use a 1-wire
	  4kb EEPROM family device (DS2433).

config W1_SLAVE_DS2433_CRC
	bool "Protect DS2433 data with a CRC16"
	depends on W1_SLAVE_DS2433
	select CRC16
	help
	  Say Y here to protect DS2433 data with a CRC16.
	  Each block has 30 bytes of data and a two byte CRC16.
	  Full block writes are only allowed if the CRC is valid.

config W1_SLAVE_DS2438
	tristate "DS2438 Smart Battery Monitor 0x26 family support"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use a 1-wire
	  DS2438 Smart Battery Monitor device support
