config W1
	tristate "Dallas's 1-wire support"
	---help---
	  Dallas's 1-wire bus is usefull to connect slow 1-pin devices 
	  such as iButtons and thermal sensors.
	  
	  If you want W1 support, you should say Y here.

	  This W1 support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called wire.ko.

config W1_MATROX
	tristate "Matrox G400 transport layer for 1-wire"
	depends on W1 && PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to communicate with your 1-wire devices
	  using Matrox's G400 GPIO pins.
	  
	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called matrox_w1.ko.

config W1_DS9490
	tristate "DS9490R transport layer driver"
	depends on W1 && USB
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to have a driver for DS9490R UWB <-> W1 bridge.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called ds9490r.ko.

config W1_DS9490_BRIDGE
	tristate "DS9490R USB <-> W1 transport layer for 1-wire"
	depends on W1_DS9490
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to communicate with your 1-wire devices
	  using DS9490R USB bridge.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called ds_w1_bridge.ko.

	tristate "Thermal family implementation"
	depends on W1
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to connect 1-wire thermal sensors to you
	  wire.

config W1_SMEM
	tristate "Simple 64bit memory family implementation"
	depends on W1
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to connect 1-wire 
	  simple 64bit memory rom(ds2401/ds2411/ds1990*) to you wire.
