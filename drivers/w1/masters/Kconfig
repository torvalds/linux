config W1_MASTER_AMD_AXI
	tristate "AMD AXI 1-wire bus host"
	help
	  Say Y here is you want to support the AMD AXI 1-wire IP core.
	  This driver makes use of the programmable logic IP to perform
	  correctly timed 1 wire transactions without relying on GPIO timing
	  through the kernel.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module will be
	  called amd_w1_axi.

config W1_MASTER_MATROX
	tristate "Matrox G400 transport layer for 1-wire"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to communicate with your 1-wire devices
	  using Matrox's G400 GPIO pins.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called matrox_w1.

config W1_MASTER_DS2490
	tristate "DS2490 USB <-> W1 transport layer for 1-wire"
  	depends on USB
  	help
	  Say Y here if you want to have a driver for DS2490 based USB <-> W1 bridges,
	  for example DS9490*.

  	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called ds2490.

config W1_MASTER_DS2482
	tristate "Maxim DS2482 I2C to 1-Wire bridge"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the Maxim DS2482
	  I2C to 1-Wire bridge.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called ds2482.

config W1_MASTER_MXC
	tristate "Freescale MXC 1-wire busmaster"
	depends on ARCH_MXC || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  Say Y here to enable MXC 1-wire host

config W1_MASTER_GPIO
	tristate "GPIO 1-wire busmaster"
	depends on GPIOLIB || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to communicate with your 1-wire devices using
	  GPIO pins. This driver uses the GPIO API to control the wire.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called w1-gpio.

config HDQ_MASTER_OMAP
	tristate "OMAP HDQ driver"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  Say Y here if you want support for the 1-wire or HDQ Interface
	  on an OMAP processor.

config W1_MASTER_SGI
	tristate "SGI ASIC driver"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want support for your 1-wire devices using
	  SGI ASIC 1-Wire interface

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called sgi_w1.

config W1_MASTER_UART
	tristate "UART 1-wire driver"
	depends on SERIAL_DEV_BUS
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to communicate with your 1-wire devices using
	  UART interface.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called w1-uart.
