config LEDS_CLEVO_MAIL
	tristate "Mail LED on Clevo notebook (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on LEDS_CLASS && X86 && SERIO_I8042 && DMI && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This driver makes the mail LED accessible from userspace
	  programs through the leds subsystem. This LED have three
	  known mode: off, blink at 0.5Hz and blink at 1Hz.

	  The driver supports two kinds of interface: using ledtrig-timer
	  or through /sys/class/leds/clevo::mail/brightness. As this LED
	  cannot change it's brightness it blinks instead. The brightness
	  value 0 means off, 1..127 means blink at 0.5Hz and 128..255 means
	  blink at 1Hz.

	  This module can drive the mail LED for the following notebooks:

	  	Clevo D410J
	  	Clevo D410V
	  	Clevo D400V/D470V (not tested, but might work)
	  	Clevo M540N
	  	Clevo M5x0N (not tested, but might work)
	  	Positivo Mobile (Clevo M5x0V)

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called leds-clevo-mail.

comment "LED Triggers"
