	  known mode: off, blink at 0.5Hz and blink at 1Hz.

	  The driver supports two kinds of interface: using ledtrig-timer
	  or through /sys/class/leds/clevo::mail/brightness. As this LED
	  cannot change it's brightness it blinks instead. The brightness
	  value 0 means off, 1..127 means blink at 0.5Hz and 128..255 means
	  blink at 1Hz.

	  This module can drive the mail LED for the following notebooks:

	  	Clevo D400P
	  	Clevo D410J
	  	Clevo D410V
	  	Clevo D400V/D470V (not tested, but might work)
