	select CRC4
	---help---
	  FSI - the FRU Support Interface - is a simple bus for low-level
	  access to POWER-based hardware.

if FSI

config FSI_MASTER_GPIO
	tristate "GPIO-based FSI master"
	depends on GPIOLIB
	select CRC4
	---help---
	This option enables a FSI master driver using GPIO lines.

config FSI_MASTER_HUB
	tristate "FSI hub master"
	---help---
	This option enables a FSI hub master driver.  Hub is a type of FSI
	master that is connected to the upstream master via a slave.  Hubs
	allow chaining of FSI links to an arbitrary depth.  This allows for
	a high target device fanout.

config FSI_MASTER_AST_CF
	tristate "FSI master based on Aspeed ColdFire coprocessor"
	depends on GPIOLIB
	depends on GPIO_ASPEED
	---help---
	This option enables a FSI master using the AST2400 and AST2500 GPIO
	lines driven by the internal ColdFire coprocessor. This requires
	the corresponding machine specific ColdFire firmware to be available.

config FSI_SCOM
	tristate "SCOM FSI client device driver"
	---help---
	This option enables an FSI based SCOM device driver.

config FSI_SBEFIFO
	tristate "SBEFIFO FSI client device driver"
	depends on OF_ADDRESS
	---help---
	This option enables an FSI based SBEFIFO device driver. The SBEFIFO is
	a pipe-like FSI device for communicating with the self boot engine
	(SBE) on POWER processors.
