	help
	  Say yes here to enable the Broadcom iProc GPIO driver.

	  The Broadcom iProc based SoCs- Cygnus, NS2, NSP and Stingray, use
	  same GPIO Controller IP hence this driver could be used for all.

	  The Broadcom Cygnus SoC has 3 GPIO controllers including the ASIU
	  GPIO controller (ASIU), the chipCommonG GPIO controller (CCM), and
	  the always-ON GPIO controller (CRMU/AON). All 3 GPIO controllers are
	  supported by this driver.

	  The Broadcom NSP has two GPIO controllers including the ChipcommonA
	  GPIO, the ChipcommonB GPIO. Later controller is supported by this
	  driver.

	  The Broadcom NS2 has two GPIO controller including the CRMU GPIO,
	  the ChipcommonG GPIO. Both controllers are supported by this driver.

	  The Broadcom Stingray GPIO controllers are supported by this driver.

	  All above SoCs GPIO controllers support basic PINCONF functions such
	  as bias pull up, pull down, and drive strength configurations, when
	  these pins are muxed to GPIO.

	  It provides the framework where pins from the individual GPIO can be
	  individually muxed to GPIO function, through interaction with the
	  SoCs IOMUX controller. This features could be used only on SoCs which
	  support individual pin muxing.

	help
	  Say yes here to enable the Broadcom Cygnus IOMUX driver.

	  The Broadcom Cygnus IOMUX driver supports group based IOMUX
	  configuration, with the exception that certain individual pins
	  can be overridden to GPIO function

	help
	  Say yes here to enable the Broadcom NS SoC pins driver.

	  The Broadcom Northstar pins driver supports muxing multi-purpose pins
	  that can be used for various functions (e.g. SPI, I2C, UART) as well
	  as GPIOs.

	  The Broadcom Northstar Plus SoC ChipcommonA GPIO controller is
	  supported by this driver.

	  The ChipcommonA GPIO controller support basic PINCONF functions such
	  as bias pull up, pull down, and drive strength configurations, when
	  these pins are muxed to GPIO.
