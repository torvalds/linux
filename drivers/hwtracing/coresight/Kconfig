	help
	  This framework provides a kernel interface for the CoreSight debug
	  and trace drivers to register themselves with. It's intended to build
	  a topological view of the CoreSight components based on a DT
	  specification and configure the right series of components when a
	  trace source gets enabled.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called coresight.

	help
	   Enable support for the Coresight Address Translation Unit (CATU).
	   CATU supports a scatter gather table of 4K pages, with forward/backward
	   lookup. CATU helps TMC ETR to use a large physically non-contiguous trace
	   buffer by translating the addresses used by ETR to the physical address
	   by looking up the provided table. CATU can also be used in pass-through
	   mode where the address is not translated.

	   To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	   module will be called coresight-catu.

	depends on ARM64 && CORESIGHT_SOURCE_ETM4X
	help
	  This driver provides support for percpu Trace Buffer Extension (TRBE).
	  TRBE always needs to be used along with its corresponding percpu ETE
	  component. ETE generates trace data which is then captured with TRBE.
	  Unlike traditional sink devices, TRBE is a CPU feature accessible via
	  system registers. But its explicit dependency with trace unit (ETE)
	  requires it to be plugged in as a coresight sink device.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called coresight-trbe.
