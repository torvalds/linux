menuconfig CORESIGHT
	bool "CoreSight Tracing Support"
	select ARM_AMBA
	select PERF_EVENTS
	help
	  This framework provides a kernel interface for the CoreSight debug
	  and trace drivers to register themselves with. It's intended to build
	  a topological view of the CoreSight components based on a DT
	  specification and configure the right series of components when a
	  trace source gets enabled.

if CORESIGHT
config CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	bool "CoreSight Link and Sink drivers"
	help
	  This enables support for CoreSight link and sink drivers that are
	  responsible for transporting and collecting the trace data
	  respectively.  Link and sinks are dynamically aggregated with a trace
	  entity at run time to form a complete trace path.

config CORESIGHT_LINK_AND_SINK_TMC
	bool "Coresight generic TMC driver"
	depends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This enables support for the Trace Memory Controller driver.
	  Depending on its configuration the device can act as a link (embedded
	  trace router - ETR) or sink (embedded trace FIFO).  The driver
	  complies with the generic implementation of the component without
	  special enhancement or added features.

config CORESIGHT_CATU
	bool "Coresight Address Translation Unit (CATU) driver"
	depends on CORESIGHT_LINK_AND_SINK_TMC
	help
	   Enable support for the Coresight Address Translation Unit (CATU).
	   CATU supports a scatter gather table of 4K pages, with forward/backward
	   lookup. CATU helps TMC ETR to use a large physically non-contiguous trace
	   buffer by translating the addresses used by ETR to the physical address
	   by looking up the provided table. CATU can also be used in pass-through
	   mode where the address is not translated.

config CORESIGHT_SINK_TPIU
	bool "Coresight generic TPIU driver"
	depends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This enables support for the Trace Port Interface Unit driver,
	  responsible for bridging the gap between the on-chip coresight
	  components and a trace for bridging the gap between the on-chip
	  coresight components and a trace port collection engine, typically
	  connected to an external host for use case capturing more traces than
	  the on-board coresight memory can handle.

config CORESIGHT_SINK_ETBV10
	bool "Coresight ETBv1.0 driver"
	depends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This enables support for the Embedded Trace Buffer version 1.0 driver
	  that complies with the generic implementation of the component without
	  special enhancement or added features.

config CORESIGHT_SOURCE_ETM3X
	bool "CoreSight Embedded Trace Macrocell 3.x driver"
	depends on !ARM64
	select CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This driver provides support for processor ETM3.x and PTM1.x modules,
	  which allows tracing the instructions that a processor is executing
	  This is primarily useful for instruction level tracing.  Depending
	  the ETM version data tracing may also be available.

config CORESIGHT_SOURCE_ETM4X
	bool "CoreSight Embedded Trace Macrocell 4.x driver"
	depends on ARM64
	select CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	select PID_IN_CONTEXTIDR
	help
	  This driver provides support for the ETM4.x tracer module, tracing the
	  instructions that a processor is executing. This is primarily useful
	  for instruction level tracing. Depending on the implemented version
	  data tracing may also be available.

config CORESIGHT_DYNAMIC_REPLICATOR
	bool "CoreSight Programmable Replicator driver"
	depends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This enables support for dynamic CoreSight replicator link driver.
	  The programmable ATB replicator allows independent filtering of the
	  trace data based on the traceid.

config CORESIGHT_STM
	bool "CoreSight System Trace Macrocell driver"
	depends on (ARM && !(CPU_32v3 || CPU_32v4 || CPU_32v4T)) || ARM64
	select CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	select STM
	help
	  This driver provides support for hardware assisted software
	  instrumentation based tracing. This is primarily used for
	  logging useful software events or data coming from various entities
	  in the system, possibly running different OSs

config CORESIGHT_CPU_DEBUG
	tristate "CoreSight CPU Debug driver"
	depends on ARM || ARM64
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  This driver provides support for coresight debugging module. This
	  is primarily used to dump sample-based profiling registers when
	  system triggers panic, the driver will parse context registers so
	  can quickly get to know program counter (PC), secure state,
	  exception level, etc. Before use debugging functionality, platform
	  needs to ensure the clock domain and power domain are enabled
	  properly, please refer Documentation/trace/coresight-cpu-debug.txt
	  for detailed description and the example for usage.
