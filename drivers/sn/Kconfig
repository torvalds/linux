	This option enables basic support for the SGI IOC3-based Base IO
	controller card.  This option does not enable any specific
	functions on such a card, but provides necessary infrastructure
	for other drivers to utilize.

	If you have an SGI Altix with an IOC3-based
	I/O controller or a PCI IOC3 serial card say Y.
	Otherwise say N.
