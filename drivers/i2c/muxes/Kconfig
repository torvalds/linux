config I2C_MUX_GPIO
	tristate "GPIO-based I2C multiplexer"
	depends on GENERIC_GPIO
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for a
	  GPIO based I2C multiplexer. This driver provides access to
	  I2C busses connected through a MUX, which is controlled
	  through GPIO pins.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called gpio-i2cmux.

config I2C_MUX_PCA9541
	tristate "NXP PCA9541 I2C Master Selector"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the NXP PCA9541
	  I2C Master Selector.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-mux-pca9541.

config I2C_MUX_PCA954x
	tristate "Philips PCA954x I2C Mux/switches"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the Philips PCA954x
	  I2C mux/switch devices.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-mux-pca954x.
