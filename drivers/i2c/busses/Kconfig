	  Philips or Velleman, Analog Devices evaluation boards, and more.
	  Basically any adapter using the parallel port as an I2C bus with

	  This driver is a replacement for (and was inspired by) an older
	  driver named i2c-philips-par.  The new driver supports more devices,
	  and makes it easier to add support for new devices.

	  An adapter type parameter is now mandatory.  Please read the file
	  Documentation/i2c/busses/i2c-parport for details.

	  Basically any adapter using the parallel port as an I2C bus with
	  no extra chipset is supported by this driver, or could be.

	  This driver is a light version of i2c-parport.  It doesn't depend
	  on the parport driver, and uses direct I/O access instead.  This
	  might be preferred on embedded systems where wasting memory for
	  the clean but heavy parport handling is not an option.  The
	  drawback is a reduced portability and the impossibility to
	  daisy-chain other parallel port devices.
	  
	  Don't say Y here if you said Y or M to i2c-parport.  Saying M to
	  both is possible but both modules should not be loaded at the same
	  time.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-parport-light.
