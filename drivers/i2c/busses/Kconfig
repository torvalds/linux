	help
	  This supports the use of the I2C interface on Atmel AT91

	  A serious problem is that there is no documented way to issue
	  repeated START conditions for more than two messages, as needed
	  to support combined I2C messages.  Use the i2c-gpio driver
	  unless your system can cope with this limitation.

	  Caution! at91rm9200, at91sam9261, at91sam9260, at91sam9263 devices
	  don't have clock stretching in transmission mode. For that reason,
	  you can encounter underrun issues causing premature stop sendings if
