	  This is a very simple module which allows you to run
	  multiple instances of the same Linux kernel, using the
	  "lguest" command found in the Documentation/virtual/lguest
	  directory.

	  Note that "lguest" is pronounced to rhyme with "fell quest",
	  not "rustyvisor". See Documentation/virtual/lguest/lguest.txt.

	  If unsure, say N.  If curious, say M.  If masochistic, say Y.
