config PTP_1588_CLOCK
	tristate "PTP clock support"
	depends on NET && POSIX_TIMERS
	select PPS
	select NET_PTP_CLASSIFY
	help
	  The IEEE 1588 standard defines a method to precisely
	  synchronize distributed clocks over Ethernet networks. The
	  standard defines a Precision Time Protocol (PTP), which can
	  be used to achieve synchronization within a few dozen
	  microseconds. In addition, with the help of special hardware
	  time stamping units, it can be possible to achieve
	  synchronization to within a few hundred nanoseconds.

	  This driver adds support for PTP clocks as character
	  devices. If you want to use a PTP clock, then you should
	  also enable at least one clock driver as well.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ptp.

config PTP_1588_CLOCK_DTE
	tristate "Broadcom DTE as PTP clock"
	depends on PTP_1588_CLOCK

	depends on ARCH_BCM_MOBILE || (ARCH_BCM_IPROC && !(ARCH_BCM_NSP || ARCH_BCM_5301X)) || COMPILE_TEST
	default y
	help
	  This driver adds support for using the Digital timing engine
	  (DTE) in the Broadcom SoC's as a PTP clock.

	  The clock can be used in both wired and wireless networks
	  for PTP purposes.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ptp_dte.

config PTP_1588_CLOCK_QORIQ
	tristate "Freescale QorIQ 1588 timer as PTP clock"
	depends on GIANFAR || FSL_DPAA_ETH || FSL_DPAA2_ETH || FSL_ENETC || FSL_ENETC_VF || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on PTP_1588_CLOCK
	default y
	help
	  This driver adds support for using the Freescale QorIQ 1588
	  timer as a PTP clock. This clock is only useful if your PTP
	  programs are getting hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet
	  packets using the SO_TIMESTAMPING API.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ptp-qoriq.

	tristate "Intel IXP46x as PTP clock"
	depends on IXP4XX_ETH
	depends on PTP_1588_CLOCK
	default y
	help
	  This driver adds support for using the IXP46X as a PTP
	  clock. This clock is only useful if your PTP programs are
	  getting hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet packets
	  using the SO_TIMESTAMPING API.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ptp_ixp46x.

	---help---
	  Supports the DP83640 PHYTER with IEEE 1588 features.

	  This driver adds support for using the DP83640 as a PTP
	  clock. This clock is only useful if your PTP programs are
	  getting hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet packets
	  using the SO_TIMESTAMPING API.

	  In order for this to work, your MAC driver must also
	  implement the skb_tx_timestamp() function.

config PTP_1588_CLOCK_PCH
	tristate "Intel PCH EG20T as PTP clock"
	depends on X86_32 || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on HAS_IOMEM && NET
	imply PTP_1588_CLOCK
	help
	  This driver adds support for using the PCH EG20T as a PTP
	  clock. The hardware supports time stamping of PTP packets
	  when using the end-to-end delay (E2E) mechansim. The peer
	  delay mechansim (P2P) is not supported.

	  This clock is only useful if your PTP programs are getting
	  hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet packets using the
	  SO_TIMESTAMPING API.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ptp_pch.

config PTP_1588_CLOCK_KVM
	tristate "KVM virtual PTP clock"
	depends on PTP_1588_CLOCK
	depends on KVM_GUEST && X86
	default y
	help
	  This driver adds support for using kvm infrastructure as a PTP
	  clock. This clock is only useful if you are using KVM guests.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ptp_kvm.
