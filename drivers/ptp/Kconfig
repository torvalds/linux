config PTP_1588_CLOCK
	tristate "PTP clock support"
	select PPS
	help
	  The IEEE 1588 standard defines a method to precisely
	  synchronize distributed clocks over Ethernet networks. The
	  standard defines a Precision Time Protocol (PTP), which can
	  be used to achieve synchronization within a few dozen
	  microseconds. In addition, with the help of special hardware
	  time stamping units, it can be possible to achieve
	  synchronization to within a few hundred nanoseconds.

	  This driver adds support for PTP clocks as character
	  devices. If you want to use a PTP clock, then you should
	  also enable at least one clock driver as well.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ptp.

config PTP_1588_CLOCK_GIANFAR
	tristate "Freescale eTSEC as PTP clock"
	depends on GIANFAR
	select PTP_1588_CLOCK
	default y
	help
	  This driver adds support for using the eTSEC as a PTP
	  clock. This clock is only useful if your PTP programs are
	  getting hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet packets
	  using the SO_TIMESTAMPING API.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called gianfar_ptp.

config PTP_1588_CLOCK_IXP46X
	tristate "Intel IXP46x as PTP clock"
	depends on IXP4XX_ETH
	select PTP_1588_CLOCK
	default y
	help
	  This driver adds support for using the IXP46X as a PTP
	  clock. This clock is only useful if your PTP programs are
	  getting hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet packets
	  using the SO_TIMESTAMPING API.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ptp_ixp46x.

config DP83640_PHY
	tristate "Driver for the National Semiconductor DP83640 PHYTER"
	depends on NETWORK_PHY_TIMESTAMPING
	depends on PHYLIB
	select PTP_1588_CLOCK
	---help---
	  Supports the DP83640 PHYTER with IEEE 1588 features.

	  This driver adds support for using the DP83640 as a PTP
	  clock. This clock is only useful if your PTP programs are
	  getting hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet packets
	  using the SO_TIMESTAMPING API.

	  In order for this to work, your MAC driver must also
	  implement the skb_tx_timestamp() function.

config PTP_1588_CLOCK_PCH
	tristate "Intel PCH EG20T as PTP clock"
	depends on PCH_GBE
	select PTP_1588_CLOCK
	default y
	help
	  This driver adds support for using the PCH EG20T as a PTP
	  clock. The hardware supports time stamping of PTP packets
	  when using the end-to-end delay (E2E) mechansim. The peer
	  delay mechansim (P2P) is not supported.

	  This clock is only useful if your PTP programs are getting
	  hardware time stamps on the PTP Ethernet packets using the
	  SO_TIMESTAMPING API.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ptp_pch.
