menuconfig EDAC
	bool "EDAC (Error Detection And Correction) reporting"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	depends on X86 || PPC || TILE || ARM
	help
	  EDAC is designed to report errors in the core system.
	  These are low-level errors that are reported in the CPU or
	  supporting chipset or other subsystems:
	  memory errors, cache errors, PCI errors, thermal throttling, etc..
	  If unsure, select 'Y'.

	  If this code is reporting problems on your system, please
	  see the EDAC project web pages for more information at:

	  <http://bluesmoke.sourceforge.net/>

	  and:

	  <http://buttersideup.com/edacwiki>

	  There is also a mailing list for the EDAC project, which can
	  be found via the sourceforge page.

config EDAC_LEGACY_SYSFS
	bool "EDAC legacy sysfs"
	default y
	help
	  Enable the compatibility sysfs nodes.
	  Use 'Y' if your edac utilities aren't ported to work with the newer
	  structures.

config EDAC_DEBUG
	bool "Debugging"
	help
	  This turns on debugging information for the entire EDAC subsystem.
	  You do so by inserting edac_module with "edac_debug_level=x." Valid
	  levels are 0-4 (from low to high) and by default it is set to 2.
	  Usually you should select 'N' here.

config EDAC_DECODE_MCE
	tristate "Decode MCEs in human-readable form (only on AMD for now)"
	depends on CPU_SUP_AMD && X86_MCE_AMD
	default y
	---help---
	  Enable this option if you want to decode Machine Check Exceptions
	  occurring on your machine in human-readable form.

	  You should definitely say Y here in case you want to decode MCEs
	  which occur really early upon boot, before the module infrastructure
	  has been initialized.

config EDAC_MCE_INJ
	tristate "Simple MCE injection interface over /sysfs"
	depends on EDAC_DECODE_MCE
	default n
	help
	  This is a simple interface to inject MCEs over /sysfs and test
	  the MCE decoding code in EDAC.

	  This is currently AMD-only.

config EDAC_MM_EDAC
	tristate "Main Memory EDAC (Error Detection And Correction) reporting"
	help
	  Some systems are able to detect and correct errors in main
	  memory.  EDAC can report statistics on memory error
	  detection and correction (EDAC - or commonly referred to ECC
	  errors).  EDAC will also try to decode where these errors
	  occurred so that a particular failing memory module can be
	  replaced.  If unsure, select 'Y'.

	  the AMD64 families of memory controllers (K8 and F10h)

config EDAC_AMD64_ERROR_INJECTION
	bool "Sysfs HW Error injection facilities"
	depends on EDAC_AMD64
	help
	  Recent Opterons (Family 10h and later) provide for Memory Error
	  Injection into the ECC detection circuits. The amd64_edac module
	  allows the operator/user to inject Uncorrectable and Correctable
	  errors into DRAM.

	  When enabled, in each of the respective memory controller directories
	  (/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mcX), there are 3 input files:

	  - inject_section (0..3, 16-byte section of 64-byte cacheline),
	  - inject_word (0..8, 16-bit word of 16-byte section),
	  - inject_ecc_vector (hex ecc vector: select bits of inject word)

	  In addition, there are two control files, inject_read and inject_write,
	  which trigger the DRAM ECC Read and Write respectively.
