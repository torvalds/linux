menuconfig EDAC
	bool "EDAC - error detection and reporting (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	depends on X86 || PPC
	help
	  EDAC is designed to report errors in the core system.
	  These are low-level errors that are reported in the CPU or
	  supporting chipset or other subsystems:
	  memory errors, cache errors, PCI errors, thermal throttling, etc..
	  If unsure, select 'Y'.

	  If this code is reporting problems on your system, please
	  see the EDAC project web pages for more information at:

	  <http://bluesmoke.sourceforge.net/>

	  and:

	  <http://buttersideup.com/edacwiki>

	  There is also a mailing list for the EDAC project, which can
	  be found via the sourceforge page.

config EDAC_DEBUG
	bool "Debugging"
	help
	  This turns on debugging information for the entire EDAC
	  sub-system. You can insert module with "debug_level=x", current
	  there're four debug levels (x=0,1,2,3 from low to high).

config EDAC_MM_EDAC
	tristate "Main Memory EDAC (Error Detection And Correction) reporting"
	default y
	help
	  Some systems are able to detect and correct errors in main
	  memory.  EDAC can report statistics on memory error
	  detection and correction (EDAC - or commonly referred to ECC
	  errors).  EDAC will also try to decode where these errors
	  occurred so that a particular failing memory module can be
	  replaced.  If unsure, select 'Y'.
