	help
	  EDAC is a subsystem along with hardware-specific drivers designed to
	  report hardware errors. These are low-level errors that are reported
	  in the CPU or supporting chipset or other subsystems:
	  memory errors, cache errors, PCI errors, thermal throttling, etc..
	  If unsure, select 'Y'.

	  The mailing list for the EDAC project is linux-edac@vger.kernel.org.

config EDAC_LEGACY_SYSFS
	bool "EDAC legacy sysfs"
	default y
	help
	  Enable the compatibility sysfs nodes.
	  Use 'Y' if your edac utilities aren't ported to work with the newer
	  structures.

config EDAC_DEBUG
	bool "Debugging"
	select DEBUG_FS
	help
	  This turns on debugging information for the entire EDAC subsystem.
	  You do so by inserting edac_module with "edac_debug_level=x." Valid
	  levels are 0-4 (from low to high) and by default it is set to 2.
	  Usually you should select 'N' here.

config EDAC_DECODE_MCE

	default y
	help
	  Enable this option if you want to decode Machine Check Exceptions
	  occurring on your machine in human-readable form.

	  You should definitely say Y here in case you want to decode MCEs
	  which occur really early upon boot, before the module infrastructure
	  has been initialized.

config EDAC_GHES
	tristate "Output ACPI APEI/GHES BIOS detected errors via EDAC"
	depends on ACPI_APEI_GHES
	select UEFI_CPER
	help
	  Not all machines support hardware-driven error report. Some of those
	  provide a BIOS-driven error report mechanism via ACPI, using the
	  APEI/GHES driver. By enabling this option, the error reports provided
	  by GHES are sent to userspace via the EDAC API.

	  When this option is enabled, it will disable the hardware-driven
	  mechanisms, if a GHES BIOS is detected, entering into the
	  "Firmware First" mode.

	  It should be noticed that keeping both GHES and a hardware-driven
	  error mechanism won't work well, as BIOS will race with OS, while
	  reading the error registers. So, if you want to not use "Firmware
	  first" GHES error mechanism, you should disable GHES either at
	  compilation time or by passing "ghes.disable=1" Kernel parameter
	  at boot time.

	  In doubt, say 'Y'.

	  Support for error detection and correction of DRAM ECC errors on
	  the AMD64 families (>= K8) of memory controllers.

	  When EDAC_DEBUG is enabled, hardware error injection facilities
	  through sysfs are available:

	  AMD CPUs up to and excluding family 0x17 provide for Memory
	  Error Injection into the ECC detection circuits. The amd64_edac
	  module allows the operator/user to inject Uncorrectable and
	  Correctable errors into DRAM.

	  When enabled, in each of the respective memory controller directories
	  (/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mcX), there are 3 input files:

	  - inject_section (0..3, 16-byte section of 64-byte cacheline),
	  - inject_word (0..8, 16-bit word of 16-byte section),
	  - inject_ecc_vector (hex ecc vector: select bits of inject word)

	  In addition, there are two control files, inject_read and inject_write,
	  which trigger the DRAM ECC Read and Write respectively.
