	  Support hosting fully virtualized guest machines using hardware
	  virtualization extensions.  You will need a fairly recent
	  processor equipped with virtualization extensions. You will also
	  need to select one or more of the processor modules below.

	  This module provides access to the hardware capabilities through
	  a character device node named /dev/kvm.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called kvm.

	  If unsure, say N.
