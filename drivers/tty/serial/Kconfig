	  external 8250/16C550 compatible UARTs.
	  The ttySn nodes are legally reserved for the 8250 serial driver
	  but are often misused by other serial drivers.

	  To use this, you should create suitable ttyATn device nodes in

	  Unlike KDB's disable_nmi command, with this driver you are always
	  able to go back to the debugger using KGDB escape sequence ($3#33).
	  This is because this console driver processes the input in NMI
	  context, and thus is able to intercept the magic sequence.

	  Note that since the console interprets input and uses polling
	  communication methods, for things like PPP you still must fully
	  detach debugger port from the KGDB NMI (i.e. disable_nmi), and
	  use raw console.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rp2.

	  If you want to compile this driver into the kernel, say Y here.  If
	  you don't have a suitable RocketPort card installed, say N.
