	  This selects whether you want to include the driver for the standard
	  serial ports.  The standard answer is Y.  People who might say N
	  here are those that are setting up dedicated Ethernet WWW/FTP
	  servers, or users that have one of the various bus mice instead of a
	  serial mouse and don't intend to use their machine's standard serial
	  port for anything.  (Note that the Cyclades multi serial port driver
	  does not need this driver built in for it to work.)

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called 8250.
	  [WARNING: Do not compile this driver as a module if you are using
	  non-standard serial ports, since the configuration information will
	  be lost when the driver is unloaded.  This limitation may be lifted
	  in the future.]

	  BTW1: If you have a mouseman serial mouse which is not recognized by
	  the X window system, try running gpm first.

	  BTW2: If you intend to use a software modem (also called Winmodem)
	  under Linux, forget it.  These modems are crippled and require
	  proprietary drivers which are only available under Windows.

	  Most people will say Y or M here, so that they can use serial mice,
	  modems and similar devices connecting to the standard serial ports.

config SERIAL_8250_DEPRECATED_OPTIONS
	bool "Support 8250_core.* kernel options (DEPRECATED)"
	depends on SERIAL_8250
	default y
	---help---
	  In 3.7 we renamed 8250 to 8250_core by mistake, so now we have to
	  accept kernel parameters in both forms like 8250_core.nr_uarts=4 and
	  8250.nr_uarts=4. We now renamed the module back to 8250, but if
	  anybody noticed in 3.7 and changed their userspace we still have to
	  keep the 8250_core.* options around until they revert the changes
	  they already did.

	  If 8250 is built as a module, this adds 8250_core alias instead. 

	  If you did not notice yet and/or you have userspace from pre-3.7, it
	  is safe (and recommended) to say N here.

config SERIAL_8250_PNP
	bool "8250/16550 PNP device support" if EXPERT
	depends on SERIAL_8250 && PNP
	default y

	  Selecting this option will add support for the RS485 capabilities
	  of the Fintek F81216A LPC to 4 UART.

	  If this option is not selected the device will be configured as a
	  standard 16550A serial port.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE
	bool "Console on 8250/16550 and compatible serial port"
	depends on SERIAL_8250=y
	select SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
	select SERIAL_EARLYCON
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a serial port as the
	  system console (the system console is the device which receives all
	  kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user
	  mode). This could be useful if some terminal or printer is connected
	  to that serial port.

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=ttyS1". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (grub or lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options
	  to the kernel at boot time.)

	  If you don't have a VGA card installed and you say Y here, the
	  kernel will automatically use the first serial line, /dev/ttyS0, as
	  system console.

	  You can set that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=uart8250,io,0x3f8,9600n8"
	  "console=uart8250,mmio,0xff5e0000,115200n8".
	  and it will switch to normal serial console when the corresponding
	  port is ready.
	  "earlycon=uart8250,io,0x3f8,9600n8"
	  "earlycon=uart8250,mmio,0xff5e0000,115200n8".
	  it will not only setup early console.

	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the

	  FourPort, Accent Async, Boca (read the Boca mini-HOWTO, available
	  from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>), or other custom
	  serial port hardware which acts similar to standard serial port

	  This option replaces the "console=ttyO" argument with the matching
	  ttyS argument if the user did not specified it on the command line.
	  This ensures that the user can see the kernel output during boot
	  which he wouldn't see otherwise. The getty has still to be configured
	  for ttyS instead of ttyO regardless of this option.
	  This option is intended for people who "automatically" enable this
	  driver without knowing that this driver requires a different console=
	  argument. If you read this, please keep this option disabled and
	  instead update your kernel command line. If you prepare a kernel for a
	  distribution or other kind of larger user base then you probably want
	  to keep this option enabled. Otherwise people might complain about a
