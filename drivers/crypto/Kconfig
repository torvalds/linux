	default y
	help
	  Some VIA processors come with an integrated crypto engine
	  (so called VIA PadLock ACE, Advanced Cryptography Engine)
	  that provides instructions for very fast cryptographic
	  operations with supported algorithms.
	  
	  The instructions are used only when the CPU supports them.
	  Otherwise software encryption is used.

config CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK_AES
	tristate "PadLock driver for AES algorithm"
	depends on CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK
	select CRYPTO_BLKCIPHER
	default m
	help
	  Use VIA PadLock for AES algorithm.

	  Available in VIA C3 and newer CPUs.

	  If unsure say M. The compiled module will be
	  called padlock-aes.ko

config CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK_SHA
	tristate "PadLock driver for SHA1 and SHA256 algorithms"
	depends on CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK
	select CRYPTO_SHA1
	select CRYPTO_SHA256
	default m
	help
	  Use VIA PadLock for SHA1/SHA256 algorithms.

	  Available in VIA C7 and newer processors.

	  If unsure say M. The compiled module will be
	  called padlock-sha.ko

	select CRYPTO_BLKCIPHER
	default m
	help
	  Say 'Y' here to use the AMD Geode LX processor on-board AES
	  engine for the CryptoAPI AES algorithm.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called geode-aes.
