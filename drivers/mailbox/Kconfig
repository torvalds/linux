menuconfig MAILBOX
	bool "Mailbox Hardware Support"
	help
	  Mailbox is a framework to control hardware communication between
	  on-chip processors through queued messages and interrupt driven
	  signals. Say Y if your platform supports hardware mailboxes.

if MAILBOX
config PL320_MBOX
	bool "ARM PL320 Mailbox"
	depends on ARM_AMBA
	help
	  An implementation of the ARM PL320 Interprocessor Communication
	  Mailbox (IPCM), tailored for the Calxeda Highbank. It is used to
	  send short messages between Highbank's A9 cores and the EnergyCore
	  Management Engine, primarily for cpufreq. Say Y here if you want
	  to use the PL320 IPCM support.

config OMAP2PLUS_MBOX
	tristate "OMAP2+ Mailbox framework support"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
	help
	  Mailbox implementation for OMAP family chips with hardware for
	  interprocessor communication involving DSP, IVA1.0 and IVA2 in
	  OMAP2/3; or IPU, IVA HD and DSP in OMAP4/5. Say Y here if you
	  want to use OMAP2+ Mailbox framework support.

config OMAP_MBOX_KFIFO_SIZE
	int "Mailbox kfifo default buffer size (bytes)"
	depends on OMAP2PLUS_MBOX
	default 256
	help
	  Specify the default size of mailbox's kfifo buffers (bytes).
	  This can also be changed at runtime (via the mbox_kfifo_size
	  module parameter).

config PCC
	bool "Platform Communication Channel Driver"
	depends on ACPI
	help
	  ACPI 5.0+ spec defines a generic mode of communication
	  between the OS and a platform such as the BMC. This medium
	  (PCC) is typically used by CPPC (ACPI CPU Performance management),
	  RAS (ACPI reliability protocol) and MPST (ACPI Memory power
	  states). Select this driver if your platform implements the
	  PCC clients mentioned above.

config ALTERA_MBOX
	tristate "Altera Mailbox"
	help
	  An implementation of the Altera Mailbox soft core. It is used
	  to send message between processors. Say Y here if you want to use the
	  Altera mailbox support.
