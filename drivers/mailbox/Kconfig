	bool "Platform Communication Channel Driver"
	depends on ACPI
	default n
	help
	  ACPI 5.0+ spec defines a generic mode of communication
	  between the OS and a platform such as the BMC. This medium
	  (PCC) is typically used by CPPC (ACPI CPU Performance management),
	  RAS (ACPI reliability protocol) and MPST (ACPI Memory power
	  states). Select this driver if your platform implements the
	  PCC clients mentioned above.

config ALTERA_MBOX
