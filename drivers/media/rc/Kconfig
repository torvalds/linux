	  Currently, all supported devices use InfraRed.

	  Enable this option if you have a video capture board even
	  if you don't need IR, as otherwise, you may not be able to
	  compile the driver for your adapter.

	---help---
	   Enable this option to build the Linux Infrared Remote
	   Control (LIRC) core device interface driver. The LIRC
	   interface passes raw IR to and from userspace, where the
	   LIRC daemon handles protocol decoding for IR reception and
	   encoding for IR transmitting (aka "blasting").
