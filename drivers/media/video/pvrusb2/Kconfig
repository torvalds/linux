	  This is a video4linux driver for Conexant 23416 based
	  usb2 personal video recorder devices.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called pvrusb2

	bool "pvrusb2 driver support for OnAir Creator model"
	depends on VIDEO_PVRUSB2 && EXPERIMENTAL
	select VIDEO_SAA711X
	select VIDEO_CS53L32A
	---help---

	  This option enables support for the OnAir Creator USB tuner
	  device.  This is a hybrid device, however currently only
	  analog mode is supported.

	  If you are in doubt, say Y.

config VIDEO_PVRUSB2_ONAIR_USB2

	depends on VIDEO_PVRUSB2 && EXPERIMENTAL
	select VIDEO_SAA711X
	select VIDEO_CS53L32A
	---help---

	  This option enables support for the OnAir USB2 tuner device
	  (also known as the Sasem tuner).  This is a hybrid device,
	  however currently only analog mode is supported.

	  If you are in doubt, say Y.

config VIDEO_PVRUSB2_SYSFS
	bool "pvrusb2 sysfs support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	default y
	depends on VIDEO_PVRUSB2 && SYSFS && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This option enables the operation of a sysfs based
	  interface for query and control of the pvrusb2 driver.

	  This is not generally needed for v4l applications,
	  although certain applications are optimized to take
	  advantage of this feature.

	  If you are in doubt, say Y.

	  Note: This feature is experimental and subject to change.

	select TUNER_SIMPLE if !DVB_FE_CUSTOMISE
	select TUNER_TDA8290 if !DVB_FE_CUSTOMIZE
	---help---

	  This option enables compilation of a DVB interface for the
	  pvrusb2 driver.  Currently this is very very experimental.
	  It is also limiting - the DVB interface can only access the
	  digital side of hybrid devices, and there are going to be
	  issues if you attempt to mess with the V4L side at the same
	  time.  Don't turn this on unless you know what you are
	  doing.

	  If you are in doubt, say N.

	  Note: This feature is very experimental and might break

config VIDEO_PVRUSB2_DEBUGIFC
	bool "pvrusb2 debug interface"
	depends on VIDEO_PVRUSB2_SYSFS
	---help---
	  This option enables the inclusion of a debug interface
	  in the pvrusb2 driver, hosted through sysfs.

	  You do not need to select this option unless you plan
	  on debugging the driver or performing a manual firmware
	  extraction.

	  If you are in doubt, say N.
