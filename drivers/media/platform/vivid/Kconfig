	  Enables a virtual video driver. This driver emulates a webcam,
	  TV, S-Video and HDMI capture hardware, including VBI support for
	  the SDTV inputs. Also video output, VBI output, radio receivers,
	  transmitters and software defined radio capture is emulated.

	  It is highly configurable and is ideal for testing applications.
	  Error injection is supported to test rare errors that are hard
	  to reproduce in real hardware.

	  Say Y here if you want to test video apps or debug V4L devices.
	  When in doubt, say N.
