	  The Synopsys DesignWare MIPI CSI-2 Receiver is a CSI-2 bridge with
	  one input port and one output port. It receives the data with the
	  help of an external MIPI PHY (C-PHY or D-PHY) and passes it to e.g.,
	  the Rockchip Video Capture (VICAP) block on recent Rockchip SoCs.
	  This is a driver for this unit.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called dw-mipi-csi2rx.
