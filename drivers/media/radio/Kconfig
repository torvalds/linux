	  Note that newer AIMSlab RadioTrack cards have a different chipset
	  and are not supported by this driver.  For these cards, use the
	  RadioTrack II driver below.

	  If you have a GemTeks combined (PnP) sound- and radio card you must
	  use this driver as a module and setup the card with isapnptools.
	  You must also pass the module a suitable io parameter, 0x248 has
	  been reported to be used by these cards.

	  In order to control your radio card, you will need to use programs
	  that are compatible with the Video For Linux API.  Information on

	help
	  Enter the frequency used for muting the radio. The device is never
	  completely silent. If the volume is just turned down, you can still
	  hear silent voices and music. For that reason, the frequency of the
	  radio device is set to the frequency you can enter here whenever
	  the device is muted. There should be no local radio station at that
	  frequency.
