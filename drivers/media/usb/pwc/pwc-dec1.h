/* Linux driver for Philips webcam
   (C) 2004-2006 Luc Saillard (luc@saillard.org)

   NOTE: this version of pwc is an unofficial (modified) release of pwc & pcwx
   driver and thus may have bugs that are not present in the original version.
   Please send bug reports and support requests to <luc@saillard.org>.
   The decompression routines have been implemented by reverse-engineering the
   Nemosoft binary pwcx module. Caveat emptor.
