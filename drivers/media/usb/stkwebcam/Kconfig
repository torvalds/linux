	  Say Y here if you want to use this type of camera.
	  Supported devices are typically found in some Asus laptops,
	  with USB id 174f:a311 and 05e1:0501. Other Syntek cameras
	  may be supported by the stk11xx driver, from which this is
	  derived, see <http://sourceforge.net/projects/syntekdriver/>

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called stkwebcam.
