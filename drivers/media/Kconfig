	---help---
	  Support for audio/video capture and overlay devices and FM radio
	  cards. The exact capabilities of each device vary. User tools for
	  this are available from
	  <ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/video4linux/>.

	  This kernel includes support for the new Video for Linux Two API,
	  (V4L2) as well as the original system. Drivers and applications
	  need to be rewritten to use V4L2, but drivers for popular cards
	  and applications for most video capture functions already exist.

	  Documentation for the original API is included in the file
	  <file:Documentation/video4linux/API.html>.  Documentation for V4L2 is
	  available on the web at <http://bytesex.org/v4l/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called videodev.

          A Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) Receiver for USB and Linux
          brought to you by the DAB-Team
          <http://wwwbode.cs.tum.edu/Par/arch/dab/>.  This driver can be taken
          as an example for URB-based bulk, control, and isochronous
          transactions. URB's are explained in
          <Documentation/usb/URB.txt>.
