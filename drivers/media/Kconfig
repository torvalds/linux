config VIDEO_DEV

	---help---
	  Support for audio/video capture and overlay devices and FM radio
	  cards. The exact capabilities of each device vary.

	  This kernel includes support for the new Video for Linux Two API,
	  (V4L2) as well as the original system. Drivers and applications
	  need to be rewritten to use V4L2, but drivers for popular cards
	  and applications for most video capture functions already exist.

	  Additional info and docs are available on the web at
	  <http://linuxtv.org>

	  Documentation for V4L2 is also available on the web at
	  <http://bytesex.org/v4l/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called videodev.

	select VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT
	default y
	---help---
	  Enables a compatibility API used by most V4L2 devices to allow
	  its usage with legacy applications that supports only V4L1 api.

	  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer Y.

config VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT
	bool "Enable Video For Linux API 1 compatible Layer"
	depends on VIDEO_DEV
	default y
	---help---
	  This api were developed to be used at Kernel 2.2 and 2.4, but
	  lacks support for several video standards. There are several
	  drivers at kernel that still depends on it.

	  Documentation for the original API is included in the file
	  <Documentation/video4linux/API.html>.

	  User tools for this are available from
	  <ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/video4linux/>.

	  If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer Y.

	  A Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) Receiver for USB and Linux
	  brought to you by the DAB-Team
	  <http://wwwbode.cs.tum.edu/Par/arch/dab/>.  This driver can be taken
	  as an example for URB-based bulk, control, and isochronous
	  transactions. URB's are explained in
	  <Documentation/usb/URB.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called dabusb.
