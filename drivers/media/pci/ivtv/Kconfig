	  This is a video4linux driver for Conexant cx23416 or cx23415 based
	  PCI personal video recorder devices.

	  This is used in devices such as the Hauppauge PVR-150/250/350/500
	  cards. There is a driver homepage at <http://www.ivtvdriver.org>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ivtv.

	  Enable the usage of the a DVB set of ioctls that were abused by
	  IVTV driver for a while.

	  Those ioctls were not needed for a long time, as IVTV implements
	  the proper V4L2 ioctls since kernel 3.3.

	  If unsure, say N.

	---help---
	  This driver provides an ALSA interface as another method for user
	  applications to obtain PCM audio data from Conexant cx23415/cx23416
	  based PCI TV cards supported by the ivtv driver.

	  The ALSA interface has much wider use in user applications performing
	  PCM audio capture, than the V4L2 "/dev/video24" PCM audio interface
	  provided by the main ivtv driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ivtv-alsa.

	  This is a framebuffer driver for the Conexant cx23415 MPEG
	  encoder/decoder.

	  This is used in the Hauppauge PVR-350 card. There is a driver
	  homepage at <http://www.ivtvdriver.org>.

	  In order to use this module, you will need to boot with PAT disabled
	  on x86 systems, using the nopat kernel parameter.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ivtvfb.
