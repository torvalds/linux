	  DO NOT ENABLE THIS OPTION UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

	  This option enables the Request API for the Media controller and V4L2
	  interfaces. It is currently needed by a few stateless codec drivers.

	  There is currently no intention to provide API or ABI stability for
	  this new API as of yet.
