	  Support for SAA7146 and AV7110 based DVB cards as produced

	  This driver only supports the fullfeatured cards with
	  onboard MPEG2 decoder.

          This driver needs an external firmware. Please use the script
          "<kerneldir>/Documentation/dvb/get_dvb_firmware av7110" to
          download/extract it, and then copy it to /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware.

	  Say Y if you own such a card and want to use it.

	  The AV7110 firmware is normally loaded by the firmware hotplug manager.
	  If you want to compile the firmware into the driver you need to say
	  Y here and provide the correct path of the firmware. You need this
	  option if you want to compile the whole driver statically into the
	  kernel.

	  The AV7110 firmware provides some code to generate an OnScreenDisplay
	  on the video output. This is kind of nonstandard and not guaranteed to
	  be maintained.

	  Anyway, some popular DVB software like VDR uses this OSD to render
	  its menus, so say Y if you want to use this software.
