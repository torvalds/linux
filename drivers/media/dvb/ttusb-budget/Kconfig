	  Support for external USB adapters designed by Technotrend and
	  produced by Hauppauge, shipped under the brand name 'Nova-USB'.

          These devices don't have a MPEG decoder built in, so you need
	  an external software decoder to watch TV.

	  Say Y if you own such a device and want to use it.
