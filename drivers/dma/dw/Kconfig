	help
	  Support the Synopsys DesignWare AHB DMA controller. This
	  can be integrated in chips such as the Atmel AT32ap7000.

config DW_DMAC_PCI
	tristate "Synopsys DesignWare AHB DMA PCI driver"
	depends on PCI
	select DW_DMAC_CORE
	help
	  Support the Synopsys DesignWare AHB DMA controller on the
	  platfroms that enumerate it as a PCI device. For example,
	  Intel Medfield has integrated this GPDMA controller.

config DW_DMAC_BIG_ENDIAN_IO
	bool "Use big endian I/O register access"
	default y if AVR32
	depends on DW_DMAC_CORE
	help
	  Say yes here to use big endian I/O access when reading and writing
	  to the DMA controller registers. This is needed on some platforms,
	  like the Atmel AVR32 architecture.

	  If unsure, use the default setting.
