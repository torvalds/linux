          Enable support for the QCOM GPI DMA controller. This controller
          provides DMA capabilities for a variety of peripheral buses such
          as I2C, UART, and SPI. By using GPI dmaengine driver, bus drivers
          can use a standardize interface that is protocol independent to
          transfer data between DDR and peripheral.

	  Enable support for the Qualcomm Technologies HIDMA Management.
	  Each DMA device requires one management interface driver
	  for basic initialization before QCOM_HIDMA channel driver can
	  start managing the channels. In a virtualized environment,
	  the guest OS would run QCOM_HIDMA channel driver and the
	  host would run the QCOM_HIDMA_MGMT management driver.

	help
	  Enable support for the Qualcomm Technologies HIDMA controller.
	  The HIDMA controller supports optimized buffer copies
	  (user to kernel, kernel to kernel, etc.).  It only supports
	  memcpy interface. The core is not intended for general
	  purpose slave DMA.
