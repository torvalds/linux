	  This allows the async_tx api to take advantage of offload engines for
	  memcpy, memset, xor, and raid6 p+q operations.  If your platform has
	  a dma engine that can perform raid operations and you have enabled
	  MD_RAID456 say Y.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  Simple DMA test client. Say N unless you're debugging a
	  DMA Device driver.
