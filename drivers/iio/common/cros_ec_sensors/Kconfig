	help
	  Module to handle 3d contiguous sensors like
	  Accelerometers, Gyroscope and Magnetometer that are
	  presented by the ChromeOS EC Sensor hub.
	  Creates an IIO device for each functions.

	help
	  Module to handle activity events presented by the ChromeOS EC sensor hub.
	  Activities can be a proximity detector (on body/off body detection)
	  or a significant motion detector.
	  Creates an IIO device to manage all activities.
