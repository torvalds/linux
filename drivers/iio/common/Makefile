# Makefile for the IIO common modules.
# Common modules contains modules, which can be shared among multiple
# IIO modules. For example if the trigger processing is common for
# multiple IIO modules then this can be moved to a common module
# instead of duplicating in each module.

# When adding new entries keep the list in alphabetical order
