	  Select yes if you want to preload some examples on machine learning core
	  and finite state machine.

	  The examples code is a 6D position recognition and is hardcoded in the
	  driver in the mlcdata structure.

	help
	  Select yes if you want to enable wake-up feature embedded into the driver.
	  Enabling this option the driver can wake-up the application processor by
	  using the irq line.

	  By default during suspend mode all enabled sensors are set in power down
	  mode to reduce the power consumption.
