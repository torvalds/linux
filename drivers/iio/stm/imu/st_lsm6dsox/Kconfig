	  Select yes if you want to enable wake-up feature embedded into the driver.
	  Enabling this option the driver can wake-up the application processor by
	  using the irq line.

	  By default during suspend mode all enabled sensors are set in power down
	  mode to reduce the power consumption.

	  Select yes if you want to enable support to voltage regulator to power up/down
	  the sensor.
	  Add the vdd-supply and vddio-supply entries into device tree to
	  automatically manage the sensor power supply.
