	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Allwinner (A10, A13 and A31) SoCs
	  GPADC. This ADC provides 4 channels which can be used as an ADC or as
	  a touchscreen input and one channel for thermal sensor.

	  The thermal sensor slows down ADC readings and can be disabled by
	  disabling CONFIG_THERMAL_OF. However, the thermal sensor should be
	  enabled by default since the SoC temperature is usually more critical
	  than ADC readings.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called sun4i-gpadc-iio.
