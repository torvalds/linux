config ADJD_S311
	tristate "ADJD-S311-CR999 digital color sensor"
	select IIO_BUFFER
	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	depends on I2C
	help
	 If you say yes here you get support for the Avago ADJD-S311-CR999
	 digital color light sensor.

	 This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	 will be called adjd_s311.

config APDS9300
	tristate "APDS9300 ambient light sensor"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 Say Y here if you want to build a driver for the Avago APDS9300
	 ambient light sensor.

	 To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	 module will be called apds9300.

config CM36651
	depends on I2C
	tristate "CM36651 driver"
	help
	 Say Y here if you use cm36651.
	 This option enables proximity & RGB sensor using
	 Capella cm36651 device driver.

	 To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	 the module will be called cm36651.

config GP2AP020A00F
	tristate "Sharp GP2AP020A00F Proximity/ALS sensor"
	depends on I2C
	select IIO_BUFFER
	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a Sharp GP2AP020A00F proximity/ALS combo-chip
	  hooked to an I2C bus.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called gp2ap020a00f.

config HID_SENSOR_ALS
	depends on HID_SENSOR_HUB
	select IIO_BUFFER
	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	select HID_SENSOR_IIO_COMMON
	select HID_SENSOR_IIO_TRIGGER
	tristate "HID ALS"
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the HID SENSOR
	  Ambient light sensor.

config SENSORS_LM3533
	tristate "LM3533 ambient light sensor"
	depends on MFD_LM3533
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the ambient light sensor
	  interface on National Semiconductor / TI LM3533 Lighting Power
	  chips.

	  The sensor interface can be used to control the LEDs and backlights
	  of the chip through defining five light zones and three sets of
	  corresponding output-current values.

	  The driver provides raw and mean adc readings along with the current
	  light zone through sysfs. A threshold event can be generated on zone
	  changes. The ALS-control output values can be set per zone for the
	  three current output channels.

config TCS3472
	tristate "TAOS TCS3472 color light-to-digital converter"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 If you say yes here you get support for the TAOS TCS3472
	 family of color light-to-digital converters with IR filter.

	 This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	 will be called tcs3472.

config SENSORS_TSL2563
	tristate "TAOS TSL2560, TSL2561, TSL2562 and TSL2563 ambient light sensors"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 If you say yes here you get support for the Taos TSL2560,
	 TSL2561, TSL2562 and TSL2563 ambient light sensors.

	 This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	 will be called tsl2563.

config TSL4531
	tristate "TAOS TSL4531 ambient light sensors"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 Say Y here if you want to build a driver for the TAOS TSL4531 family
	 of ambient light sensors with direct lux output.

	 To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	 module will be called tsl4531.

config VCNL4000
	tristate "VCNL4000 combined ALS and proximity sensor"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 Say Y here if you want to build a driver for the Vishay VCNL4000
	 combined ambient light and proximity sensor.

	 To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	 module will be called vcnl4000.
