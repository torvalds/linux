config ADJD_S311

	select IIO_BUFFER
	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	depends on I2C
	help
	 If you say yes here you get support for the Avago ADJD-S311-CR999
	 digital color light sensor.

	 This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	 will be called adjd_s311.

config SENSORS_LM3533
	tristate "LM3533 ambient light sensor"
	depends on MFD_LM3533
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the ambient light sensor
	  interface on National Semiconductor / TI LM3533 Lighting Power
	  chips.

	  The sensor interface can be used to control the LEDs and backlights
	  of the chip through defining five light zones and three sets of
	  corresponding output-current values.

	  The driver provides raw and mean adc readings along with the current
	  light zone through sysfs. A threshold event can be generated on zone
	  changes. The ALS-control output values can be set per zone for the
	  three current output channels.

config VCNL4000
	tristate "VCNL4000 combined ALS and proximity sensor"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 Say Y here if you want to build a driver for the Vishay VCNL4000
	 combined ambient light and proximity sensor.

	 To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	 module will be called vcnl4000.
