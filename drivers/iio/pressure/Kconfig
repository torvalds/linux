	  Pressure driver

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
          will be called hid-sensor-press.

config MPL115
	tristate "Freescale MPL115A2 pressure sensor driver"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the Freescale MPL115A2
	  pressure sensor connected via I2C.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
          will be called mpl115.

config MPL3115
	tristate "Freescale MPL3115A2 pressure sensor driver"
	depends on I2C
	select IIO_BUFFER
	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the Freescale MPL3115A2
	  pressure sensor / altimeter.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
          will be called mpl3115.

config IIO_ST_PRESS
	tristate "STMicroelectronics pressure sensor Driver"
	depends on (I2C || SPI_MASTER) && SYSFS

	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER if (IIO_BUFFER)
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for STMicroelectronics pressure
	  sensors: LPS001WP, LPS25H, LPS331AP.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, these modules
	  will be created:
	  - st_pressure (core functions for the driver [it is mandatory]);
	  - st_pressure_i2c (necessary for the I2C devices [optional*]);
	  - st_pressure_spi (necessary for the SPI devices [optional*]);

	  (*) one of these is necessary to do something.

config IIO_ST_PRESS_SPI

config T5403
	tristate "EPCOS T5403 digital barometric pressure sensor driver"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the EPCOS T5403 pressure sensor
	  connected via I2C.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
          will be called t5403.
