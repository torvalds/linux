	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices AD8366 and similar
	  gain amplifiers. This driver supports the following gain amplifiers
	  from Analog Devices:
	    AD8366 Dual-Digital Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA)
	    ADA4961 BiCMOS RF Digital Gain Amplifier (DGA)
	    ADL5240 Digitally controlled variable gain amplifier (VGA)
	    HMC1119 0.25 dB LSB, 7-Bit, Silicon Digital Attenuator

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ad8366.

	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices ADA4250
	  SPI Amplifier's support. The driver provides direct access via
	  sysfs.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
