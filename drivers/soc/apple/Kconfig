	  Apple SoCs such as the M1 come with various co-processors running
	  their proprietary RTKit operating system. This option enables support
	  for the protocol library used to communicate with those. It is used

	  Apple SART is a simple DMA address filter used on Apple SoCs such
	  as the M1. It is usually required for the NVMe coprocessor which does
	  not use a proper IOMMU.
