          Provides the driver to enable and disable the isolation between the
          processing system and programmable logic part by using the logicoreIP
          register set. This driver also configures the frequency based on the
          clock information from the logicoreIP register set.

          If you say yes here you get support for the logicoreIP.

          If unsure, say N.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
          module will be called xlnx_vcu.
