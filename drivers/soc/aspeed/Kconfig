	help
	  Control LPC firmware cycle mappings through ioctl()s. The driver
	  also provides a read/write interface to a BMC ram region where the
	  host LPC read/write region can be buffered.

config ASPEED_LPC_SNOOP
	tristate "ASPEED LPC snoop support"
	select REGMAP
	select MFD_SYSCON
	default ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Provides a driver to control the LPC snoop interface which
	  allows the BMC to listen on and save the data written by
	  the host to an arbitrary LPC I/O port.

	  Enable support for ast2600 MCTP Controller.
	  The MCTP controller allows the BMC to communicate with devices on
	  the host PCIe network.

config ASPEED_UART_ROUTING
	tristate "ASPEED uart routing control"
	select REGMAP
	select MFD_SYSCON
	default ARCH_ASPEED

	  Provides a driver to control the UART routing paths, allowing
	  users to perform runtime configuration of the RX muxes among
	  the UART controllers and I/O pins.

config ASPEED_LPC_MAILBOX
	tristate "ASPEED LPC mailbox support"
	select REGMAP
	select MFD_SYSCON
	default ARCH_ASPEED
