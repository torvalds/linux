	  Enables driver for Qualcomm's Cloud AI accelerator PCIe cards that are
	  designed to accelerate Deep Learning inference workloads.

	  The driver manages the PCIe devices and provides an IOCTL interface
	  for users to submit workloads to the devices.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called qaic.
