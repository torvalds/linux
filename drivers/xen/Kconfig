config XEN_BALLOON
	bool "Xen memory balloon driver"

	  The balloon driver allows the Xen domain to request more memory from

	  return unneeded memory to the system.

config XEN_SELFBALLOONING
	bool "Dynamically self-balloon kernel memory to target"
	depends on XEN && XEN_BALLOON && CLEANCACHE && SWAP && XEN_TMEM
	help
	  Self-ballooning dynamically balloons available kernel memory driven
	  by the current usage of anonymous memory ("committed AS") and
	  controlled by various sysfs-settable parameters.  Configuring
	  FRONTSWAP is highly recommended; if it is not configured, self-
	  ballooning is disabled by default. If FRONTSWAP is configured,
	  frontswap-selfshrinking is enabled by default but can be disabled
	  with the 'tmem.selfshrink=0' kernel boot parameter; and self-ballooning
	  is enabled by default but can be disabled with the 'tmem.selfballooning=0'
	  kernel boot parameter.  Note that systems without a sufficiently
	  large swap device should not enable self-ballooning.

config XEN_BALLOON_MEMORY_HOTPLUG
	bool "Memory hotplug support for Xen balloon driver"
	depends on XEN_BALLOON && MEMORY_HOTPLUG
	help
	  Memory hotplug support for Xen balloon driver allows expanding memory
	  available for the system above limit declared at system startup.
	  It is very useful on critical systems which require long
	  run without rebooting.

	  Memory could be hotplugged in following steps:

	    1) target domain: ensure that memory auto online policy is in
	       effect by checking /sys/devices/system/memory/auto_online_blocks
	       file (should be 'online').

	    2) control domain: xl mem-max <target-domain> <maxmem>
	       where <maxmem> is >= requested memory size,

	    3) control domain: xl mem-set <target-domain> <memory>
	       where <memory> is requested memory size; alternatively memory
	       could be added by writing proper value to
	       /sys/devices/system/xen_memory/xen_memory0/target or
	       /sys/devices/system/xen_memory/xen_memory0/target_kb on the
	       target domain.

	  Alternatively, if memory auto onlining was not requested at step 1
	  the newly added memory can be manually onlined in the target domain
	  by doing the following:

		for i in /sys/devices/system/memory/memory*/state; do \
		  [ "`cat "$i"`" = offline ] && echo online > "$i"; done

	  or by adding the following line to udev rules:

	  SUBSYSTEM=="memory", ACTION=="add", RUN+="/bin/sh -c '[ -f /sys$devpath/state ] && echo online > /sys$devpath/state'"

	  A PV guest can have more memory than this limit if is

config XEN_SCRUB_PAGES_DEFAULT
	bool "Scrub pages before returning them to system by default"
	depends on XEN_BALLOON
	default y
	help
	  Scrub pages before returning them to the system for reuse by
	  other domains.  This makes sure that any confidential data
	  is not accidentally visible to other domains.  It is more
	  secure, but slightly less efficient. This can be controlled with
	  xen_scrub_pages=0 parameter and
	  /sys/devices/system/xen_memory/xen_memory0/scrub_pages.
	  This option only sets the default value.

	  If in doubt, say yes.

config XEN_DEV_EVTCHN

config XENFS

         The old xenstore userspace tools expect to find "xenbus"
         under /proc/xen, but "xenbus" is now found at the root of the
         xenfs filesystem.  Selecting this causes the kernel to create
         the compatibility mount point /proc/xen if it is running on
         a xen platform.
         If in doubt, say yes.

	  Allows userspace processes and kernel modules to use Xen backed
	  dma-buf implementation. With this extension grant references to

	  converted into a local dma-buf for local export.

config XEN_GRANT_DEV_ALLOC

	default m
	help
	  Allows userspace processes to create pages with access granted

	  or as part of an inter-domain shared memory channel.

config XEN_GRANT_DMA_ALLOC
	bool "Allow allocating DMA capable buffers with grant reference module"
	depends on XEN && HAS_DMA
	help
	  Extends grant table module API to allow allocating DMA capable
	  buffers and mapping foreign grant references on top of it.
	  The resulting buffer is similar to one allocated by the balloon
	  driver in that proper memory reservation is made by
	  ({increase|decrease}_reservation and VA mappings are updated if
	  needed).
	  This is useful for sharing foreign buffers with HW drivers which
	  cannot work with scattered buffers provided by the balloon driver,
	  but require DMAable memory instead.

	depends on XEN_BACKEND
	default m
	help
	  The PCI device backend driver allows the kernel to export arbitrary
	  PCI devices to other guests. If you select this to be a module, you
	  will need to make sure no other driver has bound to the device(s)
	  you want to make visible to other guests.

	  The parameter "passthrough" allows you specify how you want the PCI
	  devices to appear in the guest. You can choose the default (0) where
	  PCI topology starts at 00.00.0, or (1) for passthrough if you want
	  the PCI devices topology appear the same as in the host.

	  The "hide" parameter (only applicable if backend driver is compiled
	  into the kernel) allows you to bind the PCI devices to this module
	  from the default device drivers. The argument is the list of PCI BDFs:
	  xen-pciback.hide=(03:00.0)(04:00.0)

	  If in doubt, say m.
