config SCSI_UFSHCD
	tristate "Universal Flash Storage Controller Driver Core"
	depends on SCSI && SCSI_DMA
	select PM_DEVFREQ
	select DEVFREQ_GOV_SIMPLE_ONDEMAND
	---help---
	This selects the support for UFS devices in Linux, say Y and make
	  sure that you know the name of your UFS host adapter (the card
	  inside your computer that "speaks" the UFS protocol, also
	  called UFS Host Controller), because you will be asked for it.
	  The module will be called ufshcd.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/ufs.txt>.
	  However, do not compile this as a module if your root file system
	  (the one containing the directory /) is located on a UFS device.

config SCSI_UFSHCD_PCI
	tristate "PCI bus based UFS Controller support"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD && PCI
	---help---
	This selects the PCI UFS Host Controller Interface. Select this if
	you have UFS Host Controller with PCI Interface.

	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM
	tristate "Platform bus based UFS Controller support"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD
	---help---
	This selects the UFS host controller support. Select this if
	you have an UFS controller on Platform bus.

	If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_QCOM
	bool "QCOM specific hooks to UFS controller platform driver"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM && ARCH_QCOM
	select PHY_QCOM_UFS
	help
	  This selects the QCOM specific additions to UFSHCD platform driver.
	  UFS host on QCOM needs some vendor specific configuration before
	  accessing the hardware which includes PHY configuration and vendor
	  specific registers.

	  Select this if you have UFS controller on QCOM chipset.
	  If unsure, say N.
