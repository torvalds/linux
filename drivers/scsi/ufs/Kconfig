config SCSI_UFSHCD
	tristate "Universal Flash Storage Controller Driver Core"
	depends on SCSI && SCSI_DMA
	select PM_DEVFREQ
	select DEVFREQ_GOV_SIMPLE_ONDEMAND
	select NLS
	---help---
	This selects the support for UFS devices in Linux, say Y and make
	  sure that you know the name of your UFS host adapter (the card
	  inside your computer that "speaks" the UFS protocol, also
	  called UFS Host Controller), because you will be asked for it.
	  The module will be called ufshcd.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/ufs.txt>.
	  However, do not compile this as a module if your root file system
	  (the one containing the directory /) is located on a UFS device.

config SCSI_UFSHCD_PCI
	tristate "PCI bus based UFS Controller support"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD && PCI
	---help---
	This selects the PCI UFS Host Controller Interface. Select this if
	you have UFS Host Controller with PCI Interface.

	  If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_DWC_TC_PCI
	tristate "DesignWare pci support using a G210 Test Chip"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD_PCI
	---help---
	  Synopsys Test Chip is a PHY for prototyping purposes.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM
	tristate "Platform bus based UFS Controller support"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD
	---help---
	This selects the UFS host controller support. Select this if
	you have an UFS controller on Platform bus.

	If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_CDNS_PLATFORM
	tristate "Cadence UFS Controller platform driver"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM
	help
	This selects the Cadence-specific additions to UFSHCD platform driver.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_DWC_TC_PLATFORM
	tristate "DesignWare platform support using a G210 Test Chip"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM
	---help---
	  Synopsys Test Chip is a PHY for prototyping purposes.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_QCOM
	tristate "QCOM specific hooks to UFS controller platform driver"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM && ARCH_QCOM
	help
	  This selects the QCOM specific additions to UFSHCD platform driver.
	  UFS host on QCOM needs some vendor specific configuration before
	  accessing the hardware which includes PHY configuration and vendor
	  specific registers.

	  Select this if you have UFS controller on QCOM chipset.
	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_HISI
	tristate "Hisilicon specific hooks to UFS controller platform driver"
	depends on (ARCH_HISI || COMPILE_TEST) && SCSI_UFSHCD_PLATFORM
	---help---
	  This selects the Hisilicon specific additions to UFSHCD platform driver.

	  Select this if you have UFS controller on Hisilicon chipset.
	  If unsure, say N.

config SCSI_UFS_BSG
	bool "Universal Flash Storage BSG device node"
	depends on SCSI_UFSHCD
	select BLK_DEV_BSGLIB
	help
	  Universal Flash Storage (UFS) is SCSI transport specification for
	  accessing flash storage on digital cameras, mobile phones and
	  consumer electronic devices.
	  A UFS controller communicates with a UFS device by exchanging
	  UFS Protocol Information Units (UPIUs).
	  UPIUs can not only be used as a transport layer for the SCSI protocol
	  but are also used by the UFS native command set.
	  This transport driver supports exchanging UFS protocol information units
	  with a UFS device. See also the ufshcd driver, which is a SCSI driver
	  that supports UFS devices.

	  Select this if you need a bsg device node for your UFS controller.
	  If unsure, say N.
