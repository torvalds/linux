	  You also need to say Y here if you have a device which speaks

	help
	  If you have a SCSI device that supports more than one LUN (Logical
	  Unit Number), e.g. a CD jukebox, and only one LUN is detected, you
	  can say Y here to force the SCSI driver to probe for multiple LUNs.
	  A SCSI device with multiple LUNs acts logically like multiple SCSI
	  devices. The vast majority of SCSI devices have only one LUN, and
	  so most people can say N here. The max_luns boot/module parameter 
	  allows to override this setting.

config SCSI_CONSTANTS
	bool "Verbose SCSI error reporting (kernel size +=12K)"

config SCSI_LOGGING
	bool "SCSI logging facility"
	depends on SCSI
	---help---
	  This turns on a logging facility that can be used to debug a number
	  of SCSI related problems.

	  If you say Y here, no logging output will appear by default, but you
	  can enable logging by saying Y to "/proc file system support" and
	  "Sysctl support" below and executing the command

	  echo "scsi log token [level]" > /proc/scsi/scsi

	  at boot time after the /proc file system has been mounted.

	  There are a number of things that can be used for 'token' (you can
	  find them in the source: <file:drivers/scsi/scsi.c>), and this
	  allows you to select the types of information you want, and the
	  level allows you to select the level of verbosity.

	  If you say N here, it may be harder to track down some types of SCSI
	  problems. If you say Y here your kernel will be somewhat larger, but
	  there should be no noticeable performance impact as long as you have
	  logging turned off.

config SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC
	bool "Asynchronous SCSI scanning"
	depends on SCSI
	help
	  The SCSI subsystem can probe for devices while the rest of the
	  system continues booting, and even probe devices on different
	  busses in parallel, leading to a significant speed-up.

	  If you have built SCSI as modules, enabling this option can
	  be a problem as the devices may not have been found by the
	  time your system expects them to have been.  You can load the
	  scsi_wait_scan module to ensure that all scans have completed.
	  If you build your SCSI drivers into the kernel, then everything
	  will work fine if you say Y here.

	  You can override this choice by specifying "scsi_mod.scan=sync"
	  or async on the kernel's command line.

	  WARNING This driver is an older aic7xxx driver and is no longer

	  possible, people should use the new Adaptec written driver instead
	  of this one.  This driver will eventually be phased out entirely.

	  2902, 2910, 293x, 294x, 394x, 3985 and several other PCI and

	  support them. It does not support the 2920 cards from Adaptec that
	  use the Future Domain SCSI controller chip. For those cards, you

	  In general, if the controller is based on an Adaptec SCSI controller

config IBMMCA_SCSI_ORDER_STANDARD

	---help---
	  In the PC-world and in most modern SCSI-BIOS-setups, SCSI-hard disks
	  are assigned to the drive letters, starting with the lowest SCSI-id
	  (physical number -- pun) to be drive C:, as seen from DOS and
	  similar operating systems. When looking into papers describing the
	  ANSI-SCSI-standard, this assignment of drives appears to be wrong.
	  The SCSI-standard follows a hardware-hierarchy which says that id 7
	  has the highest priority and id 0 the lowest. Therefore, the host
	  adapters are still today everywhere placed as SCSI-id 7 by default.
	  In the SCSI-standard, the drive letters express the priority of the
	  disk. C: should be the hard disk, or a partition on it, with the
	  highest priority. This must therefore be the disk with the highest
	  SCSI-id (e.g. 6) and not the one with the lowest! IBM-BIOS kept the
	  original definition of the SCSI-standard as also industrial- and
	  process-control-machines, like VME-CPUs running under realtime-OSes
	  (e.g. LynxOS, OS9) do.

	  If you like to run Linux on your MCA-machine with the same
	  assignment of hard disks as seen from e.g. DOS or OS/2 on your
	  machine, which is in addition conformant to the SCSI-standard, you
	  must say Y here. This is also necessary for MCA-Linux users who want
	  to keep downward compatibility to older releases of the
	  IBM-MCA-SCSI-driver (older than driver-release 2.00 and older than
	  June 1997).

	  If you like to have the lowest SCSI-id assigned as drive C:, as
	  modern SCSI-BIOSes do, which does not conform to the standard, but
	  is widespread and common in the PC-world of today, you must say N
	  here. If unsure, say Y.

config IBMMCA_SCSI_DEV_RESET

	  However, some devices exist, like special-control-devices,
	  SCSI-CNC-machines, SCSI-printer or scanners of older type, that do
	  not reset when switched on. If you say Y here, each device connected
	  to your SCSI-bus will be issued a reset-command after it has been
	  probed, while the kernel is booting. This may cause problems with
	  more modern devices, like hard disks, which do not appreciate these
	  reset commands, and can cause your system to hang. So say Y only if

	int "default tagged command queue depth"

	---help---
	  "Tagged command queuing" is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves
	  performance: the host adapter can send several SCSI commands to a
	  device's queue even if previous commands haven't finished yet.
	  Because the device is intelligent, it can optimize its operations
	  (like head positioning) based on its own request queue. Some SCSI
	  devices don't implement this properly; if you want to disable this
	  feature, enter 0 or 1 here (it doesn't matter which).

	  The default value is 8 and should be supported by most hard disks.
	  This value can be overridden from the boot command line using the
	  'tags' option as follows (example):
	  'ncr53c8xx=tags:4/t2t3q16/t0u2q10' will set default queue depth to
	  4, set queue depth to 16 for target 2 and target 3 on controller 0
	  and set queue depth to 10 for target 0 / lun 2 on controller 1.

	  The normal answer therefore is to go with the default 8 and to use

	  command queue depth.

	  There is no safe option other than using good SCSI devices.

	  Modern hard disks are able to support 64 tags and even more, but
	  do not seem to be faster when more than 32 tags are being used.

	  So, the normal answer here is to go with the default value 32 unless
	  you are using very large hard disks with large cache (>= 1 MB) that

	  There is no safe option and the default answer is recommended.

	  are respectively the maximum data transfer rates in mega-transfers
	  per second for each class.  For example, a FAST-20 Wide 16 device is
	  able to transfer data at 20 million 16 bit packets per second for a
	  total rate of 40 MB/s.

	  You may specify 0 if you want to only use asynchronous data
	  transfers. This is the safest and slowest option. Otherwise, specify
	  a value between 5 and 80, depending on the capability of your SCSI
	  controller.  The higher the number, the faster the data transfer.
	  Note that 80 should normally be ok since the driver decreases the
	  value automatically according to the controller's capabilities.

	  Your answer to this question is ignored for controllers with NVRAM,
	  since the driver will get this information from the user set-up.  It
	  also can be overridden using a boot setup option, as follows
	  (example): 'ncr53c8xx=sync:12' will allow the driver to negotiate
	  for FAST-20 synchronous data transfer (20 mega-transfers per
	  second).

	  The normal answer therefore is not to go with the default but to
	  select the maximum value 80 allowing the driver to use the maximum
	  value supported by each controller. If this causes problems with
	  your SCSI devices, you should come back and decrease the value.

	  There is no safe option other than using good cabling, right
	  terminations and SCSI conformant devices.
