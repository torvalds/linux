	  that "speaks" the SCSI protocol, also called SCSI controller),

	  If you want to use SCSI scanners, synthesizers or CD-writers or just
	  about anything having "SCSI" in its name other than hard disks,
	  CD-ROMs or tapes, say Y here. These won't be supported by the kernel
	  directly, so you need some additional software which knows how to
	  talk to these devices using the SCSI protocol:

	  For scanners, look at SANE (<http://www.sane-project.org/>). For CD
	  writer software look at Cdrtools
	  (<http://cdrecord.berlios.de/private/cdrecord.html>)
	  and for burning a "disk at once": CDRDAO
	  (<http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/>). Cdparanoia is a high
	  quality digital reader of audio CDs (<http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/>).
	  For other devices, it's possible that you'll have to write the
	  driver software yourself. Please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/scsi-generic.txt> for more information.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read

	  This is a driver for SCSI media changers.  Most common devices are

	  don't need this for those tiny 6-slot cdrom changers.  Media
	  changers are listed as "Type: Medium Changer" in /proc/scsi/scsi.
	  If you have such hardware and want to use it with linux, say Y
	  here.  Check <file:Documentation/scsi/scsi-changer.txt> for details.
	
	  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be

config SCSI_ENCLOSURE

	  Enclosures are devices sitting on or in SCSI backplanes that

	  certain enclosure conditions to be reported and is not required.

config SCSI_MULTI_LUN
	bool "Probe all LUNs on each SCSI device"

	help
	  Some devices support more than one LUN (Logical Unit Number) in order
	  to allow access to several media, e.g. CD jukebox, USB card reader,
	  mobile phone in mass storage mode. This option forces the kernel to
	  probe for all LUNs by default. This setting can be overriden by
	  max_luns boot/module parameter. Note that this option does not affect
	  devices conforming to SCSI-3 or higher as they can explicitely report
	  their number of LUNs. It is safe to say Y here unless you have one of
	  those rare devices which reacts in an unexpected way when probed for
	  multiple LUNs.

config SCSI_CONSTANTS
	bool "Verbose SCSI error reporting (kernel size +=12K)"
	depends on SCSI
	help
	  The error messages regarding your SCSI hardware will be easier to
	  understand if you say Y here; it will enlarge your kernel by about
	  12 KB. If in doubt, say Y.

config SCSI_LOGGING
	bool "SCSI logging facility"
	depends on SCSI
	---help---
	  This turns on a logging facility that can be used to debug a number
	  of SCSI related problems.

	  If you say Y here, no logging output will appear by default, but you
	  can enable logging by saying Y to "/proc file system support" and
	  "Sysctl support" below and executing the command

	  echo <bitmask> > /proc/sys/dev/scsi/logging_level

	  where <bitmask> is a four byte value representing the logging type
	  and logging level for each type of logging selected.

	  There are a number of logging types and you can find them in the
	  source at <file:drivers/scsi/scsi_logging.h>. The logging levels
	  are also described in that file and they determine the verbosity of
	  the logging for each logging type.

	  If you say N here, it may be harder to track down some types of SCSI
	  problems. If you say Y here your kernel will be somewhat larger, but
	  there should be no noticeable performance impact as long as you have
	  logging turned off.

config SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC
	bool "Asynchronous SCSI scanning"
	depends on SCSI
	help
	  The SCSI subsystem can probe for devices while the rest of the
	  system continues booting, and even probe devices on different
	  busses in parallel, leading to a significant speed-up.

	  If you have built SCSI as modules, enabling this option can
	  be a problem as the devices may not have been found by the
	  time your system expects them to have been.  You can load the
	  scsi_wait_scan module to ensure that all scans have completed.
	  If you build your SCSI drivers into the kernel, then everything
	  will work fine if you say Y here.

	  You can override this choice by specifying "scsi_mod.scan=sync"
	  or async on the kernel's command line.

	  WARNING This driver is an older aic7xxx driver and is no longer

	  take the place of this one, and it is recommended that whenever
	  possible, people should use the new Adaptec written driver instead
	  of this one.  This driver will eventually be phased out entirely.

	  This is support for the various aic7xxx based Adaptec SCSI

	  2902, 2910, 293x, 294x, 394x, 3985 and several other PCI and
	  motherboard based SCSI controllers from Adaptec. It does not support
	  the AAA-13x RAID controllers from Adaptec, nor will it likely ever
	  support them. It does not support the 2920 cards from Adaptec that
	  use the Future Domain SCSI controller chip. For those cards, you
	  need the "Future Domain 16xx SCSI support" driver.

	  In general, if the controller is based on an Adaptec SCSI controller
	  chip from the aic777x series or the aic78xx series, this driver
	  should work. The only exception is the 7810 which is specifically

	  Information on the configuration options for this controller can be

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS
	int "default tagged command queue depth"
	depends on SCSI_ZALON || SCSI_NCR_Q720
	default "8"
	---help---
	  "Tagged command queuing" is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves
	  performance: the host adapter can send several SCSI commands to a
	  device's queue even if previous commands haven't finished yet.
	  Because the device is intelligent, it can optimize its operations
	  (like head positioning) based on its own request queue. Some SCSI
	  devices don't implement this properly; if you want to disable this
	  feature, enter 0 or 1 here (it doesn't matter which).

	  The default value is 8 and should be supported by most hard disks.
	  This value can be overridden from the boot command line using the
	  'tags' option as follows (example):
	  'ncr53c8xx=tags:4/t2t3q16/t0u2q10' will set default queue depth to
	  4, set queue depth to 16 for target 2 and target 3 on controller 0
	  and set queue depth to 10 for target 0 / lun 2 on controller 1.

	  The normal answer therefore is to go with the default 8 and to use
	  a boot command line option for devices that need to use a different
	  command queue depth.

	  There is no safe option other than using good SCSI devices.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_MAX_TAGS
	int "maximum number of queued commands"

	  This option allows you to specify the maximum number of commands
	  that can be queued to any device, when tagged command queuing is
	  possible. The default value is 32. Minimum is 2, maximum is 64.
	  Modern hard disks are able to support 64 tags and even more, but
	  do not seem to be faster when more than 32 tags are being used.

	  So, the normal answer here is to go with the default value 32 unless
	  you are using very large hard disks with large cache (>= 1 MB) that
	  are able to take advantage of more than 32 tagged commands.

	  There is no safe option and the default answer is recommended.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYNC
	int "synchronous transfers frequency in MHz"
	depends on SCSI_ZALON || SCSI_NCR_Q720
	default "20"
	---help---
	  The SCSI Parallel Interface-2 Standard defines 5 classes of transfer
	  rates: FAST-5, FAST-10, FAST-20, FAST-40 and FAST-80.  The numbers
	  are respectively the maximum data transfer rates in mega-transfers
	  per second for each class.  For example, a FAST-20 Wide 16 device is
	  able to transfer data at 20 million 16 bit packets per second for a
	  total rate of 40 MB/s.

	  You may specify 0 if you want to only use asynchronous data
	  transfers. This is the safest and slowest option. Otherwise, specify
	  a value between 5 and 80, depending on the capability of your SCSI
	  controller.  The higher the number, the faster the data transfer.
	  Note that 80 should normally be ok since the driver decreases the
	  value automatically according to the controller's capabilities.

	  Your answer to this question is ignored for controllers with NVRAM,
	  since the driver will get this information from the user set-up.  It
	  also can be overridden using a boot setup option, as follows
	  (example): 'ncr53c8xx=sync:12' will allow the driver to negotiate
	  for FAST-20 synchronous data transfer (20 mega-transfers per
	  second).

	  The normal answer therefore is not to go with the default but to
	  select the maximum value 80 allowing the driver to use the maximum
	  value supported by each controller. If this causes problems with
	  your SCSI devices, you should come back and decrease the value.

	  There is no safe option other than using good cabling, right
	  terminations and SCSI conformant devices.

	  operation at up to 10 MB/s. On machines where the SCSI bus
	  controlled by the MESH can have external devices connected, it is
