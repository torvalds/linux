config SCSI_MPT2SAS
	tristate "LSI MPT Fusion SAS 2.0 Device Driver"
	depends on PCI && SCSI
	select SCSI_SAS_ATTRS
	---help---
	This driver supports PCI-Express SAS 6Gb/s Host Adapters.

config SCSI_MPT2SAS_MAX_SGE
	int "LSI MPT Fusion Max number of SG Entries (16 - 128)"
	depends on PCI && SCSI && SCSI_MPT2SAS
	default "128"
	range 16 128
	---help---
	This option allows you to specify the maximum number of scatter-
	gather entries per I/O. The driver default is 128, which matches
	SAFE_PHYS_SEGMENTS.  However, it may decreased down to 16.
	Decreasing this parameter will reduce memory requirements
	on a per controller instance.

config SCSI_MPT2SAS_LOGGING
	bool "LSI MPT Fusion logging facility"
	depends on PCI && SCSI && SCSI_MPT2SAS
	---help---
	This turns on a logging facility.
