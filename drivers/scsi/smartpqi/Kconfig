	This driver supports Microchip PQI controllers.

	<http://www.microchip.com>

	To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	module will be called smartpqi.

        Note: the aacraid driver will not manage a smartpqi
              controller. You need to enable smartpqi for smartpqi
              controllers. For more information, please see
              Documentation/scsi/smartpqi.rst
