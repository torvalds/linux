	  Generic support for non-volatile memory devices including
	  ACPI-6-NFIT defined resources.  On platforms that define an
	  NFIT, or otherwise can discover NVDIMM resources, a libnvdimm
	  bus is registered to advertise PMEM (persistent memory)
	  namespaces (/dev/pmemX). A PMEM namespace refers to a
	  memory resource that may span multiple DIMMs and support DAX
	  (see CONFIG_DAX).

	  Memory ranges for PMEM are described by either an NFIT

	  CONFIG_X86_PMEM_LEGACY), or it is manually specified by the
	  'memmap=nn[KMG]!ss[KMG]' kernel command line (see
	  Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.rst).  This driver converts
	  these persistent memory ranges into block devices that are
	  capable of DAX (direct-access) file system mappings.  See
	  Documentation/driver-api/nvdimm/nvdimm.rst for more details.

	help
	  The Block Translation Table (BTT) provides atomic sector
	  update semantics for persistent memory devices, so that
	  applications that rely on sector writes not being torn (a
	  guarantee that typical disks provide) can continue to do so.
	  The BTT manifests itself as an alternate personality for an
	  NVDIMM namespace, i.e. a namespace can be in raw mode pmemX,
	  or 'sectored' mode.

	  Map persistent memory, i.e. advertise it to the memory
	  management sub-system.  By default persistent memory does
	  not support direct I/O, RDMA, or any other usage that
	  requires a 'struct page' to mediate an I/O request.  This

	  Support raw device dax access to a persistent memory

	  persistent memory, this capability provides a mechanism to

	help
	  KMSAN, and other memory debug facilities, increase the size of
	  'struct page' to contain extra metadata. This collides with
	  the NVDIMM capability to store a potentially
	  larger-than-"System RAM" size 'struct page' array in a
	  reservation of persistent memory rather than limited /
	  precious DRAM. However, that reservation needs to persist for
	  the life of the given NVDIMM namespace. If you are using KMSAN
	  to debug an issue unrelated to NVDIMMs or DAX then say N to this
	  option. Otherwise, say Y but understand that any namespaces
	  (with the page array stored pmem) created with this build of
	  the kernel will permanently reserve and strand excess
	  capacity compared to the CONFIG_KMSAN=n case.
