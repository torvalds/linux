config PARIDE_PD
	tristate "Parallel port IDE disks"
	depends on PARIDE
	help
	  This option enables the high-level driver for IDE-type disk devices
	  connected through a parallel port. If you chose to build PARIDE
	  support into your kernel, you may answer Y here to build in the
	  parallel port IDE driver, otherwise you should answer M to build
	  it as a loadable module. The module will be called pd. You
	  must also have at least one parallel port protocol driver in your
	  system. Among the devices supported by this driver are the SyQuest
	  EZ-135, EZ-230 and SparQ drives, the Avatar Shark and the backpack
	  hard drives from MicroSolutions.

config PARIDE_PCD
	tristate "Parallel port ATAPI CD-ROMs"
	depends on PARIDE
	select CDROM
	help
	  This option enables the high-level driver for ATAPI CD-ROM devices
	  connected through a parallel port. If you chose to build PARIDE
	  support into your kernel, you may answer Y here to build in the
	  parallel port ATAPI CD-ROM driver, otherwise you should answer M to
	  build it as a loadable module. The module will be called pcd. You
	  must also have at least one parallel port protocol driver in your
	  system. Among the devices supported by this driver are the
	  MicroSolutions backpack CD-ROM drives and the Freecom Power CD. If
	  you have such a CD-ROM drive, you should also say Y or M to "ISO
	  9660 CD-ROM file system support" below, because that's the file
	  system used on CD-ROMs.

config PARIDE_PF
	tristate "Parallel port ATAPI disks"
	depends on PARIDE
	help
	  This option enables the high-level driver for ATAPI disk devices
	  connected through a parallel port. If you chose to build PARIDE
	  support into your kernel, you may answer Y here to build in the
	  parallel port ATAPI disk driver, otherwise you should answer M
	  to build it as a loadable module. The module will be called pf.
	  You must also have at least one parallel port protocol driver in
	  your system. Among the devices supported by this driver are the
	  MicroSolutions backpack PD/CD drive and the Imation Superdisk
	  LS-120 drive.

config PARIDE_PT
	tristate "Parallel port ATAPI tapes"

	  parallel port version of the HP 5GB drive.

config PARIDE_PG
	tristate "Parallel port generic ATAPI devices"
	depends on PARIDE
	help
	  This option enables a special high-level driver for generic ATAPI
	  devices connected through a parallel port. The driver allows user
	  programs, such as cdrtools, to send ATAPI commands directly to a
	  device.

	  If you chose to build PARIDE support into your kernel, you may
	  answer Y here to build in the parallel port generic ATAPI driver,
	  otherwise you should answer M to build it as a loadable module. The
	  module will be called pg.

	  You must also have at least one parallel port protocol driver in
	  your system.

	  This driver implements an API loosely related to the generic SCSI
	  driver. See <file:include/linux/pg.h>. for details.

	  You can obtain the most recent version of cdrtools from
	  <ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/>. Versions 1.6.1a3 and
	  later fully support this driver.

	  In other words, if your BACKPACK drive doesn't say "Series 6" on the
	  bottom, enable this option.

	  If you chose to build PARIDE support into your kernel, you may
	  answer Y here to build in the protocol driver, otherwise you should
