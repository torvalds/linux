config FPGA
	tristate "FPGA Configuration Framework"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want support for configuring FPGAs from the
	  kernel.  The FPGA framework adds a FPGA manager class and FPGA
	  manager drivers.

config FPGA_REGION
	tristate "FPGA Region"
	depends on OF && FPGA_BRIDGE
	help
	  FPGA Regions allow loading FPGA images under control of
	  the Device Tree.

config FPGA_MGR_SOCFPGA
	tristate "Altera SOCFPGA FPGA Manager"
	depends on ARCH_SOCFPGA
	help
	  FPGA manager driver support for Altera SOCFPGA.

config FPGA_MGR_SOCFPGA_A10
	tristate "Altera SoCFPGA Arria10"
	depends on ARCH_SOCFPGA
	help
	  FPGA manager driver support for Altera Arria10 SoCFPGA.

config FPGA_MGR_ZYNQ_FPGA
	tristate "Xilinx Zynq FPGA"
	depends on ARCH_ZYNQ || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on HAS_DMA
	help
	  FPGA manager driver support for Xilinx Zynq FPGAs.

config FPGA_BRIDGE
	tristate "FPGA Bridge Framework"
	depends on OF
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support bridges connected between host
	  processors and FPGAs or between FPGAs.

config SOCFPGA_FPGA_BRIDGE
	tristate "Altera SoCFPGA FPGA Bridges"
	depends on ARCH_SOCFPGA && FPGA_BRIDGE
	help
	  Say Y to enable drivers for FPGA bridges for Altera SOCFPGA
	  devices.

config ALTERA_FREEZE_BRIDGE
	tristate "Altera FPGA Freeze Bridge"
	depends on ARCH_SOCFPGA && FPGA_BRIDGE
	help
	  Say Y to enable drivers for Altera FPGA Freeze bridges.  A
	  freeze bridge is a bridge that exists in the FPGA fabric to
	  isolate one region of the FPGA from the busses while that
	  region is being reprogrammed.
