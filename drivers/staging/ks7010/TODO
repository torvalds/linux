KS7010 Linux driver
===================

This driver is based on source code from the Ben Nanonote extra repository [1]
which is based on the original v007 release from Renesas [2]. Some more
background info about the chipset can be found here [3] and here [4]. Thank
you to all which already participated in cleaning up the driver so far!

TODO
----

First a few words what not to do (at least not blindly):

- don't be overly strict with the 80 char limit. Only if it REALLY makes the
  code more readable

Now the TODOs:

- fix codechecker warnings (checkpatch, sparse, smatch). But PLEASE make sure
  that you are not only silencing the warning but really fixing code. You
  should understand the change you submit.
- fix the 'card removal' event when card is inserted when booting
- check what other upstream wireless mechanisms can be used instead of the
  custom ones here
- Switch to use LIB80211.
- Switch to use MAC80211.
- Switch to use CFG80211.

Please send any patches to:
Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
Linux Driver Project Developer List <driverdev-devel@linuxdriverproject.org>
