	  If you say Y here you want to be able to access a limited number of
	  VME windows in a manner at least semi-compatible with the interface
	  provided with the original driver at <http://www.vmelinux.org/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will
	  be called vme_user. If unsure, say N.
