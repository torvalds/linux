TODO:

1. A per-device/tty port context required to support multiple devices
on same platform.
Plan: Each BT, FM and GPS device would be a platform-device with its platform-data
mentioning which of the ST device it wants to attach itself onto.

There by each of the ST device which is also a platform device upon receiving
a st_register() would know whether the registration from BT/FM or GPS was intended for it.

2. Improve upon the way requirement of line discipline is communicated to
user-space, The current user-space application which open/installs ldisc
as and when required can be found at,
http://git.omapzoom.org/?pÿatform/hardware/ti/omap3.git;aÿob;fÿ_st/uim/uim.c;ha16c2c2b5085eb54a1bbc7096d779d7594eb11;hbìlair

3. Re-view/Re-work on the locking.

4. Re-structure to make the ldisc driver more generic for chipsets which mux
multiple connectivity (BT, FM, GPS) upon 1 TTY port.

5. Step up and maintain this driver to ensure that it continues
to work.  Having the hardware for this is pretty much a
requirement.  If this does not happen, the will be removed in
the 2.6.35 kernel release.

Please send patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com>.
