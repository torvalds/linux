TODO:

1. A per-device/tty port context required to support multiple devices
on same platform.
Plan: Each BT, FM and GPS device would be a platform-device with its platform-data
mentioning which of the ST device it wants to attach itself onto.

There by each of the ST device which is also a platform device upon receiving
a st_register() would know whether the registration from BT/FM or GPS was intended for it.

2. Improve upon the way requirement of line discipline is communicated to
user-space, The current user-space application which open/installs ldisc
as and when required can be found at,
http://dev.omapzoom.org/pub/scm/jsistla/L23-btfm.git
branch: UIM

3. Re-view/Re-work on the locking.

4. Step up and maintain this driver to ensure that it continues
to work.  Having the hardware for this is pretty much a
requirement.  If this does not happen, the will be removed in
the 2.6.35 kernel release.

Please send patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com>.
