Description:	This entry is used by Unisys application software on the guest
		to acknowledge completion of specific events for integration
		purposes, but these acknowledgements are not required for the
		guest to operate correctly. The interface accepts one of two
		strings: MODULES_LOADED to indicate that the s-Par driver
		modules have been loaded successfully, or CALLHOMEDISK_MOUNTED,
		which indicates that the disk used to support call home services
		has been successfully mounted.

Description:	This entry is used by a Unisys support script installed on the
		guest, and triggered by a udev event. The support script is
		responsible for enabling and disabling SR-IOV devices when the
		PF device is being recovered in another guest.

		Some SR-IOV devices have problems when the PF is reset without
		first disabling all VFs attached to that PF. s-Par handles this
		situation by sending a message to guests using these VFs, and
		the script will disable the device. When the PF is recovered,
		another message is sent to the guests to re-enable the VFs.

		The parahotplug/deviceenabled interface is used to acknowledge
		the recovery message.
