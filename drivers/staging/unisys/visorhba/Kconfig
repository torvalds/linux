	---help---
	The Unisys visorhba driver provides support for s-Par HBA
	devices exposed on the s-Par visorbus. When a message is sent
	to visorbus to create a HBA device, the probe function of
	visorhba is called to create the scsi device.
	If you say Y here, you will enable the Unisys visorhba driver.
