To-do list:

* Correct the coding style according to Linux guidelines; please read the document
  at https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html.
* Remove unnecessary debugging/printing macros; for those that are still needed
  use the proper kernel API (pr_debug(), dev_dbg(), netdev_dbg()).
* Remove dead code such as unusued functions, variables, fields, etc..
* Use in-kernel API and remove unnecessary wrappers where possible.
* Fix bugs due to code that sleeps in atomic context.
* Remove the HAL layer and migrate its functionality into the relevant parts of
  the driver.
* Switch to use LIB80211.
* Switch to use MAC80211.
