	  Driver to enable the bus infrastructure for the QorIQ DPAA2
	  architecture.  The fsl-mc bus driver handles discovery of
	  DPAA2 objects (which are represented as Linux devices) and
	  binding objects to drivers.

	  Driver for the DPAA2 DPIO object.  A DPIO provides queue and
	  buffer management facilities for software to interact with
	  other DPAA2 objects. This driver does not expose the DPIO
	  objects individually, but groups them under a service layer
	  API.
