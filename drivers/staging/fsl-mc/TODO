* Add README file (with ASCII art) describing relationships between
  DPAA2 objects and how combine them to make a NIC, an LS2 switch, etc.
  Also, define all acronyms used.

* Decide if multiple root fsl-mc buses will be supported per Linux instance,
  and if so add support for this.

* Add at least one device driver for a DPAA2 object (child device of the
  fsl-mc bus).  Most likely candidate for this is adding DPAA2 Ethernet
  driver support, which depends on drivers for several objects: DPNI,
  DPIO, DPMAC.  Other pre-requisites include:

     * interrupt support. for meaningful driver support we need
       interrupts, and thus need message interrupt support by the bus
       driver.
          -Note: this has dependencies on generic MSI support work
           in process upstream, see [1] and [2].

     * Management Complex (MC) command serialization. locking mechanisms
       are needed by drivers to serialize commands sent to the MC, including
       from atomic context.

     * MC firmware uprev.  The MC firmware upon which the fsl-mc
       bus driver and DPAA2 object drivers are based is continuing
       to evolve, so minor updates are needed to keep in sync with binary
       interface changes to the MC.

* Cleanup
