API

Master window broadcast select mask
-----------------------------------

API currently provides no method to set or get Broadcast Select mask. Suggest
somthing like:

	int vme_master_bmsk_set (struct vme_resource *res, int mask);
	int vme_master_bmsk_get (struct vme_resource *res, int *mask);


Interrupt Generation
--------------------

Add optional timeout when waiting for an IACK.


CR/CSR Buffer
-------------

The VME API provides no functions to access the buffer mapped into the CR/CSR
space.


Mailboxes
---------

Whilst not part of the VME specification, they are provided by a number of
chips. They are currently not supported at all by the API.


Core
====

- Improve generic sanity checks (Such as does an offset and size fit within a
  window and parameter checking).
