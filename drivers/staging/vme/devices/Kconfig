config VME_USER
	tristate "VME user space access driver"
	help
	  If you say Y here you want to be able to access a limited number of
	  VME windows in a manner at least semi-compatible with the interface
	  provided with the original driver at http://vmelinux.org/.

config VME_PIO2
	tristate "GE PIO2 VME"
	depends on GPIOLIB
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for the GE PIO2. The PIO2 is a 6U VME
	  slave card, implementing 32 solid-state relay switched IO lines, in
	  4 groups of 8. Each bank of IO lines is built to function as input,
	  output or both depending on the variant of the card.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will
	  be called vme_pio2. If unsure, say N.
