Introduction
============
This driver is for controlling pi433, a radio module for the Raspberry Pi
(www.pi433.de). It supports transmission and reception. It can be opened
by multiple applications for transmission and reception. While transmit
jobs were queued and process automatically in the background, the first
application asking for reception will block out all other applications
until something gets received terminates the read request.
The driver supports on the fly reloading of the hardware fifo of the rf
chip, thus enabling for much longer telegrams then hardware fifo size.

Discription of driver operation
===============================

a) transmission

Each transmission can take place with a different configuration of the rf
module. Therefore each application can set its own set of parameters. The driver
takes care, that each transmission takes place with the parameterset of the
application, that requests the transmission. To allow the transmission to take
place in the background, a tx thread is introduced.
The transfer of data from the main thread to the tx thread is realised by a
kfifo. With each write request of an application, the passed in data and the
corresponding parameter set gets written to the kfifo.
On the other "side" of the kfifo, the tx thread continuously checks, whether the
kfifo is empty. If not, it gets one set of config and data from the kfifo. If
there is no receive request or the receiver is still waiting for something in
the air, the rf module is set to standby, the parameters for transmission gets
set, the hardware fifo of the rf chip gets preloaded and the transmission gets
started. Upon hardware fifo threshold interrupt it gets reloaded, thus enabling
much longer telegrams than the hardware fifo size. If the telegram is sent and there
is more data available in the kfifo, the procedure is repeated. If not the
transmission cycle ends.

b) reception

Since there is only one application allowed to receive data at a time, for
reception there is only one configuration set.
As soon as an application sets a request for receiving a telegram, the reception
configuration set is written to the rf module and it gets set into receiving mode.
Now the driver is waiting, that a predefined RSSI level (signal strength at the
receiver) is reached. Until this hasn't happened, the reception can be
interrupted by the transmission thread at any time to insert a transmission cycle.
As soon as the predefined RSSI level is meat, a receiving cycle starts. Similar
as described for the transmission cycle the read out of the hardware fifo is done
dynamically. Upon each hardware fifo threshold interrupt, a portion of data gets
read. So also for reception it is possible to receive more data then the hardware
fifo can hold.


Driver API
==========

The driver is currently implemented as a character device. Therefore it supports
the calls open, ioctl, read, write and close.


params for ioctl
----------------

There are four options:
PI433_IOC_RD_TX_CFG - get the transmission parameters from the driver
PI433_IOC_WR_TX_CFG - set the transmission parameters
PI433_IOC_RD_RX_CFG - get the receiving parameters from the driver
PI433_IOC_WR_RX_CFG - set the receiving parameters

The tx configuration is transferred via struct pi433_tx_cfg, the parameterset for transmission.

		using a protocol not compatible with the packet engine of the rf69 chip.
