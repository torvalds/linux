	  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrCOMM protocol.
	  To compile it as modules, choose M here: the modules will be
	  called ircomm and ircomm_tty.
	  IrCOMM implements serial port emulation, and makes it possible to
	  use all existing applications that understands TTY's with an
	  infrared link.  Thus you should be able to use application like PPP,
	  minicom and others.
