	  The Lucent WaveLAN (formerly NCR and AT&T; or DEC RoamAbout DS) is
	  a Radio LAN (wireless Ethernet-like Local Area Network) using the
	  radio frequencies 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz.

	  If you want to use an ISA WaveLAN card under Linux, say Y and read
	  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. Some more specific
	  information is contained in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/wavelan.txt> and in the source code
	  <file:drivers/net/wireless/wavelan.p.h>.

	  You will also need the wireless tools package available from
	  <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>.
	  Please read the man pages contained therein.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called wavelan.

	  Say Y here if you intend to attach an AT&T/Lucent Wavelan PCMCIA
	  (PC-card) wireless Ethernet networking card to your computer.  This
	  driver is for the non-IEEE-802.11 Wavelan cards.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called wavelan_cs.  If unsure, say N.
