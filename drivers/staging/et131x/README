This is a driver for the ET1310 network device.

Based on the driver found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/et131x/

Cleaned up immensely by Olaf Hartman and Christoph Hellwig <hch@infradead.org>

Note, the powermanagement options were removed from the vendor provided
driver as they did not build properly at the time.

TODO:
	- Look at reducing the number of spinlocks
	- Simplify code in nic_rx_pkts(), when determining multicast_pkts_rcvd
	- Implement NAPI support
	- in et131x_tx(), don't return NETDEV_TX_BUSY, just drop the packet with	  kfree_skb().

Please send patches to:
	Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
	Mark Einon <mark.einon@gmail.com>
