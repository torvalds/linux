Introduction
============

These drivers add support for IndustryPack devices: carrier and mezzanine
boards.

The ipack driver is just an abstraction of the bus providing the common
operations between the two kind of boards.

TODO
====

TPCI-200
--------

* It receives the name of the mezzanine plugged in each slot by SYSFS.
  No autodetection supported yet, because the mezzanine driver could not be
  loaded at the time that the tpci200 driver loads.

* It has a linked list with the tpci200 devices it is managing. Get rid of it
  and use driver_for_each_device() instead.

IP-OCTAL
--------

* It has a linked list which saves the devices it is currently
  managing. It should use the driver_for_each_device() function. It is not there
  due to the impossibility of using container_of macro to recover the
  corresponding "struct ipoctal" because the attribute "struct ipack_device" is
  a pointer. This code should be refactored.

Ipack
-----

* The structures and API exported can be improved a lot. For example, the
  way to unregistering mezzanine devices, doing the mezzanine driver a call to
  remove_device() to notify the carrier driver, or the opposite with the call to
  the ipack_driver_ops' remove() function could be improved.
