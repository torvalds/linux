	help
		Broadcom BCM2835 and similar SoCs have a VPU called VideoCore.
		This config enables the VCHIQ driver, which implements a
		messaging interface between the kernel and the firmware running
		on VideoCore. Other drivers use this interface to communicate to
		the VPU. More specifically, the VCHIQ driver is used by
		audio/video and camera drivers as well as for implementing MMAL
		API, which is in turn used by several multimedia services on the
		BCM2835 family of SoCs.

		Defaults to Y when the Broadcom Videocore services are included
		in the build, N otherwise.

if BCM2835_VCHIQ

config VCHIQ_CDEV
	bool "VCHIQ Character Driver"
	help
		Enable the creation of VCHIQ character driver. The cdev exposes
		ioctls used by userspace libraries and testing tools to interact
		with VideoCore, via the VCHIQ core driver (Check BCM2835_VCHIQ
		for more info).

		This can be set to 'N' if the VideoCore communication is not
		needed by userspace but only by other kernel modules
		(like bcm2835-audio).

		If not sure, set this to 'Y'.
