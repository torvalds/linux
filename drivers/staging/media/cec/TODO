The reason why cec.c is still in staging is that I would like
to have a bit more confidence in the uABI. The kABI is fine,
no problem there, but I would like to let the public API mature
a bit.

Once I'm confident that I didn't miss anything then the cec.c source
can move to drivers/media and the linux/cec.h and linux/cec-funcs.h
headers can move to uapi/linux and added to uapi/linux/Kbuild to make
them public.

Hopefully this will happen later in 2016.

Other TODOs:

- There are two possible replies to CEC_MSG_INITIATE_ARC. How to handle that?
- Should CEC_LOG_ADDR_TYPE_SPECIFIC be replaced by TYPE_2ND_TV and TYPE_PROCESSOR?
  And also TYPE_SWITCH and TYPE_CDC_ONLY in addition to the TYPE_UNREGISTERED?
  This should give the framework more information about the device type
  since SPECIFIC and UNREGISTERED give no useful information.
- Once this is out of staging this should no longer be a separate
  config option, instead it should be selected by drivers that want it.
- Revisit the IS_REACHABLE(RC_CORE): perhaps the RC_CORE support should
  be enabled through a separate config option in drivers/media/Kconfig
  or rc/Kconfig?
