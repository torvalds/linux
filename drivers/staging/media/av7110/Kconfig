	  Support for SAA7146 and AV7110 based DVB cards as produced
	  by Fujitsu-Siemens, Technotrend, Hauppauge and others.

	  This driver only supports the fullfeatured cards with
	  onboard MPEG2 decoder.

	  This driver needs an external firmware. Please use the script
	  "<kerneldir>/scripts/get_dvb_firmware av7110" to
	  download/extract it, and then copy it to /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware
	  or /lib/firmware (depending on configuration of firmware hotplug).

	  Alternatively, you can download the file and use the kernel's
	  EXTRA_FIRMWARE configuration option to build it into your
	  kernel image by adding the filename to the EXTRA_FIRMWARE
	  configuration option string.

	  Say Y if you own such a card and want to use it.

	  The AV7110 firmware provides some code to generate an OnScreenDisplay
	  on the video output. This is kind of nonstandard and not guaranteed to
	  be maintained.

	  Anyway, some popular DVB software like VDR uses this OSD to render
	  its menus, so say Y if you want to use this software.

	  All other people say N.

# While technically independent, it doesn't make sense to keep
# it if we drop support for AV7110, as no other driver will use it.
