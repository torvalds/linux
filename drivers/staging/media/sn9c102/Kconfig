	  This driver is DEPRECATED, please use the gspca sonixb and
	  sonixj modules instead.

	  Say Y here if you want support for cameras based on SONiX SN9C101,
	  SN9C102, SN9C103, SN9C105 and SN9C120 PC Camera Controllers.

	  See <file:drivers/staging/media/sn9c102/sn9c102.txt> for more info.

	  If you have webcams that are only supported by this driver and not by
	  the gspca driver, then contact the linux-media mailinglist.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called sn9c102.
