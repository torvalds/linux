* Support for HEVC is planned for this driver.

  Given the V4L controls for that CODEC will be part of
  the uABI, it will be required to have the driver in staging.

  For this reason, we are keeping this driver in staging for now.

* Evaluate introducing a helper to consolidate duplicated
  code in rkvdec_request_validate and cedrus_request_validate.
  The helper needs to the driver private data associated with
  the videobuf2 queue, from a media request.
