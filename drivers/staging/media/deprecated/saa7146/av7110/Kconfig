	  Support for SAA7146 and AV7110 based DVB cards as produced
	  by Fujitsu-Siemens, Technotrend, Hauppauge and others.

	  This driver only supports the fullfeatured cards with
	  onboard MPEG2 decoder.

	  This driver needs an external firmware. Please use the script
	  "<kerneldir>/scripts/get_dvb_firmware av7110" to
	  download/extract it, and then copy it to /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware
	  or /lib/firmware (depending on configuration of firmware hotplug).

	  Alternatively, you can download the file and use the kernel's
	  EXTRA_FIRMWARE configuration option to build it into your
	  kernel image by adding the filename to the EXTRA_FIRMWARE
	  configuration option string.

	  This driver is deprecated and is scheduled for removal by
	  the beginning of 2023. See the TODO file for more information.

	  Say Y if you own such a card and want to use it.

	  The AV7110 firmware provides some code to generate an OnScreenDisplay
	  on the video output. This is kind of nonstandard and not guaranteed to
	  be maintained.

	  Anyway, some popular DVB software like VDR uses this OSD to render
	  its menus, so say Y if you want to use this software.

	  This driver is deprecated and is scheduled for removal by
	  the beginning of 2023. See the TODO file for more information.

	  All other people say N.

	  Support for Budget Patch (full TS) modification on
	  SAA7146+AV7110 based cards (DVB-S cards). This
	  driver doesn't use onboard MPEG2 decoder. The
	  card is driven in Budget-only mode. Card is
	  required to have loaded firmware to tune properly.
	  Firmware can be loaded by insertion and removal of
	  standard AV7110 driver prior to loading this
	  driver.

	  This driver is deprecated and is scheduled for removal by
	  the beginning of 2023. See the TODO file for more information.

	  Say Y if you own such a card and want to use it.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called budget-patch.
