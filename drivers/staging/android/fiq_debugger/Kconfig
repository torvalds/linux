	help
	  The FIQ serial debugger can accept commands even when the
	  kernel is unresponsive due to being stuck with interrupts
	  disabled.

config FIQ_DEBUGGER_NO_SLEEP
	bool "Keep serial debugger active"

	  Enables the serial debugger at boot. Passing
	  fiq_debugger.no_sleep on the kernel commandline will

	help
	  Don't disable the wakeup irq when enabling the uart clock.  This will
	  cause extra interrupts, but it makes the serial debugger usable with
	  on some MSM radio builds that ignore the uart clock request in power
	  collapse.

config FIQ_DEBUGGER_CONSOLE
