config ASHMEM
	bool "Enable the Anonymous Shared Memory Subsystem"
	depends on SHMEM
	help
	  The ashmem subsystem is a new shared memory allocator, similar to
	  POSIX SHM but with different behavior and sporting a simpler
	  file-based API.

	  It is, in theory, a good memory allocator for low-memory devices,
	  because it can discard shared memory units when under memory pressure.

config DEBUG_KINFO
	bool "Debug Kernel Information Support"
	depends on KALLSYMS
	help
	  This supports kernel information backup for bootloader usage.
	  Specifics:
	   - The kallsyms symbols for unwind_backtrace
	   - Page directory pointer
	   - UTS_RELEASE
	   - BUILD_INFO(ro.build.fingerprint)
