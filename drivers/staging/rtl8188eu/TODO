TODO:
- find and remove remaining code valid only for 5 HGz. Most of the obvious
  ones have been removed, but things like channel > 14 still exist.
- find and remove any code for other chips that is left over
- convert any remaining unusual variable types
- find codes that can use %pM and %Nph formatting
- checkpatch.pl fixes - most of the remaining ones are lines too long. Many
  of them will require refactoring
- merge Realtek's bugfixes and new features into the driver
- switch to use LIB80211
- switch to use MAC80211

Please send any patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>,
and Larry Finger <Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net>.
