Description
===========
This document describes how to install the Invensense device driver into a
Linux kernel. The Invensense driver currently supports the following sensors:
- ITG-3500
- MPU-6050
- MPU-9150
- MPU-6500
- MPU-9250
- MPU-3050
- MPU-6XXX(either MPU6050 or MPU6500, driver to do auto detection)

The slave address of each device is either 0x68 or 0x69, depending on the AD0
pin value of the device. Please refer to the appropriate product specification
document for further information regarding the AD0 pin. The driver supports both
addresses.

The following files are included in this package:
- Kconfig
- Makefile
- inv_mpu_core.c
- inv_mpu_misc.c
- inv_mpu_trigger.c
- inv_mpu3050_iio.c
- inv_mpu_iio.h
- inv_mpu_ring.c
- inv_slave_bma250.c
- dmpDefaultMPU6050.c
- dmpkey.h
- dmpmap.h
- mpu.h


Integrating the Driver in the Linux Kernel
==========================================
Please add the files as follows:
- Add mpu.h to "kernel/include/linux".
- Add all other files to drivers/staging/iio/imu/inv_mpu
(another directory is acceptable, but this is the recommended destination)

In order to see the driver in menuconfig when building the kernel, please
make modifications as shown below:

    modify "drivers/staging/iio/imu/Kconfig" with:
    >> source "drivers/staging/iio/imu/inv_mpu/Kconfig"

    modify "drivers/staging/iio/imu/Makefile" with:
    >> obj-y += inv_mpu/


Board and Platform Data
=======================
In order to recognize the Invensense device on the I2C bus, the board file must
be modified.
The i2c_board_info instance must be defined as shown below.

Interrupt Pin
-------------
The hardcoded value of 140 corresponds to the GPIO input pin connected to the
Invensense device's interrupt pin.
This pin will most likely be different for your platform, and the value should
be changed accordingly.

Platform Data
-------------
The platform data (orientation matrix and secondary bus configurations) must be
modified as show below, according to your particular platform configuration.

Please note that the MPU-9150 it is treated as a MPU-6050 with AKM8975 on the
device's secondary I2C interface. Thus the secondary I2C address must be
provided.

Please note that the MPU-9250 it is treated as a MPU-6500 with AKM8963 on the
device's secondary I2C interface. Thus the secondary I2C address must be
provided.

Board File Modifications for Secondary I2C Configuration

};

IIO subsystem
=============
A successful installation will create the following two new directories under
/sys/bus/iio/devices:
    - iio:device0
    - trigger0

Also, a new file, "iio:device0", will be created in the /dev/ diretory.
(if you have more than one IIO device, the file will be named "iio:deviceX",
where X is a number)


Communicating with the Driver in Userspace
------------------------------------------
The driver generates several files in sysfs upon installation.
These files are used to communicate with the driver. The files can be found
at /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0 (or ../iio:deviceX as shown above).

A brief description of the pertinent files for each Invensense device is shown
below:

ITG-3500
--------
temperature (Read-only)
--Read temperature data directly from the temperature register.

sampling_frequency (Read/write)
--Configure the ADC sampling rate and FIFO output rate.

sampling_frequency_available(read-only)
--show commonly used frequency

clock_source (Read-only)
--Check which clock-source is used by the chip.

power_state (Read/write)
--turn on/off the power supply

self_test (read-only)
--read this entry trigger self test. The return value is D.
D is the success/fail.
For different chip, the result is different for success/fail.
1 means success 0 means fail. The LSB of D is for gyro; the bit
next to LSB of D is for accel. The bit 2 of D is for compass result.

key (read-only)
--show the key value of this driver. Used by MPL.

gyro_matrix (read-only)
--show the orientation matrix obtained from the board file.

MPU-6050 and MPU-6500
---------------------
MPU-6050 and MPU-6500 have all sysfs files belonging to ITG-3500 (shown above).
In addition, it has the files below:

gyro_enable (read/write)
--enable/disable gyro functionality. Affects raw_gyro. Turning this off this
  will shut down gyro and save power.

accl_enable (read/write)
--enable/disable accelerometer functionality. Affects raw_accl.
Turning this off this will shut down accel and save power.

firmware_loaded (read/write)
--Flag indicating the whether firmware is loaded or not in the DMP engine.
0 means no firmware loaded. 1 means firmware is already loaded . This
flag can only be written as 0. It internally updates to 1.

dmp_on(read/write)
--This entry controls whether to run DMP or not.
Write 1 to enable DMP and write 0 to disable dmp.
Please note that firmware_loaded must be 1 in order to enable DMP.

dmp_int_on(read/write)
--This entry controls whether dmp interrupt is on/off.
Please note that firmware_loaded must be 1.
Also, we'd like to remind you that it is sometimes advantageous to
turn interrupts off while the DMP is running.

dmp_output_rate
--control dmp output rate when dmp is on.

dmp_event_int_on(read/write)
--This entry controls whether dmp event interrupt is on/off.
Please note that turning this on will turn off the data interrupt.
Interrupts will be generated only when events occur.
This is useful for saving power when the system is waiting for a special event
to wake up.

dmp_firmware (write only binary file)
--DMP firmware code is loaded into this entry.
If loading is successful, the firmware_loaded flag will be updated to 1.
In order to load new firmware, the firmware_loaded flag must be first set to 0.

accel_matrix
--orientation matrix for accelerometer.

quaternion_on
--Turn on/off quaterniion data output. DMP is required for this feature.

pedometer_time
pedometer_steps,
--Pedometer related entries

event_tap
event_display_orientation
event_accel_motion
event_smd
--Event related entries.
Please poll these entries to read their values. Direct reads will yield
meaningless results.
Further details are provided in the DMP Events section of this README.

tap_on
--Controls tap function of DMP

tap_time
tap_min_count
tap_threshold
--Tap related entries. Controls various parameters of tap function.

display_orientation_on
--Turn on/off display orientation function of DMP.

smd_enable
enable SMD(Significant Motion Detection) detection.

smd_threshold
This set the threshold of the motion when SMD start to be triggered. The
value is in acclerometer counts.

smd_delay_threshold
This sets the threshold of time after which SMD can be triggered.
The value is in seconds.

smd_delay_threshold2
This sets the threshold of time during which SMD can be triggered (after the
smd_delay_threshold timer has expired).
The value is in seconds.

quaternion_on
--Turn on/off quaterniion data output. DMP is required for this feature.

Low power accel motion interrupt related settings.
if motion_lpa_on is set, this will disable all engines except accel. Accel will
enter low power mode and the whole chip will be turned on/off at specific frequency.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
motion_lpa_duration
--set motion duration. in ms. This means filtered out all the motino interrupts
  during this period.

motion_lpa_threshold
--set motion threshold. in mg. The maximum is 1020mg and resolution is 32mg.

motion_lpa_on
--turn on/off motion function.

motion_lpa_freq
--motion lpa frequency. which determines power on/off frequency.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MPU-9150
--------
MPU-9150 has all of MPU-6050's entries. It also has two additional entries,
described below.

compass_enable (read/write)
--Enables compass function.

compass_matrix (read-only)
--Compass orientation matrix

MPU-3050 with BMA250 on secondary I2C interface
-----------------------------------------------
MPU-3050 with BMA250 on the secondary I2C interface has ever ITG-3500 entry.
It also has two additional entries, shown below:

accl_matrix

accl_enable

Suspend and Resume
===================================================
The suspend and resume functions are call backs registered to the system
and executed when the system goes in suspend and resumes.
It is enabled when CONFIG_PM is defined.
The current behavior is simple:
- suspend will turn off the chip
- resume will turn on the chip

However, it is possible for the driver to do more complex things;
for example, leaving pedometers running when system is off. This can save whole
system power while letting pedometer working. Other behaviors are possible
too.

DMP Event
=========
A DMP Event is an event that is output by the DMP unit within the Invensense
device (MPU).
Only the MPU-6050, MPU-6500, MPU-9250, MPU-9150, MPU-9250 feature the DMP.

There are four sysfs entries for DMP events:
- event_tap
- event_display_orientation
- event_accel_motion
- event_smd

These events must be polled before reading.

The proper method to poll sysfs is as follows:
1. open file.
2. dummy read.
3. poll.
4. once the poll passed, use fopen and fread to read the sysfs entry.
5. interpret the data.

Streaming Data to an Userspace Application
==========================================
When streaming data to an userspace application, we recommend that you access
gyro/accel/compass data via /dev/iio:device0.

Please follow the steps below to read data at a constant rate from the driver:

1. Write a 1 to power_state to turn on the chip. This is the default setting
   after installing the driver.
2. Write the desired output rate to fifo_rate.
3. Write 1 to enable to turn on the event.
4. Read /dev/iio:device0 to get a string of gyro/accel/compass data.
5. Parse this string to obtain each gyro/accel/compass element.
6. If dmp firmware code is loaded, use "dmp_on" to enable/disable dmp.
7. If compass is enabled, the output will contain compass data.


Recommended Sysfs Entry Setup Senquence
=======================================

Without DMP Firmware
--------------------
1. Set "power_state" to 1,
2. Set the scale and fifo rate values according to your needs.
3. Set gyro_enable, accel_enable, and compass_enable according to your needs.
   For example:
    - If you only want gyro data, set accel_enable to 0 (and compass_enable to
      0, if applicable).
    - If you only want accel data, set gyro_enable to 0 (and compass_enable to
      0, if applicable).
    - If you only want compass data, set gyro_enable to 0 and accel_enable to 0.
4. Set "enable" to 1.
5. You will now get the output that you want.

With DMP Firmware
-----------------
1. Set "power_state" to 1.
2. Write "0" to firmware_loaded if it is not zero already.
3. Load firmware into "dmp_firmware" as a whole. Don't split the DMP firmware
   image.
4. Make sure firmware_loaded is 1 after loading the DMP image.
5. Make appropriate configurations as shown above in the "without DMP firmware"
   case.
6. Set dmp_on to 1.
7. Set "enable" to 1.

Please note that the enable function uses the enable entry under
"/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/buffer"

Test Applications
=================
A test application is located under software/simple_apps/mpu_iio.
This application is stand-alone in that it cannot be run concurrently with other
entities trying to access the device node(s) or sysfs entries; in particular,
the

   mpu_iio -c 10 -l 3 -r

Please use mpu_iio.c and iio_utils.h as example code for your development
purposes.

Stress test application
=================================
A stress test application is located under software/simple_apps/stress_iio.
This application simulates HAL's usage calls to the driver. It creates three
threads. One for data read; one for event read; one for sysfs control.
It can run without any parameters or run with some control parameters. Please
see README in the same directories for details.
