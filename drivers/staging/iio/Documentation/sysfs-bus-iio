Description:
		An event driven driver of data capture to an in kernel buffer.
		May be provided by a device driver that also has an IIO device
		based on hardware generated events (e.g. data ready) or
		provided by a separate driver for other hardware (e.g.
		periodic timer, gpio or high resolution timer).
		Contains trigger type specific elements. These do not
		generalize well and hence are not documented in this file.

What:		/sys/.../device[n]/sampling_frequency
KernelVersion:	2.6.35
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Some devices have internal clocks.  This parameter sets the
		resulting sampling frequency.  In many devices this
		parameter has an effect on input filters etc rather than
		simply controlling when the input is sampled.  As this
		effects datardy triggers, hardware buffers and the sysfs
		direct access interfaces, it may be found in any of the
		relevant directories.  If it effects all of the above
		then it is to be found in the base device directory as here.

Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		If known for a device, offset to be added to in[m]_raw prior
		to scaling by in[_name][m]_scale in order to obtain voltage in
		millivolts.  Not present if the offset is always 0 or unknown.
		If m is not present, then voltage offset applies to all in
		channels. May be writable if a variable offset is controlled
		by the device. Note that this is different to calibbias which
		is for devices that apply offsets to compensate for variation
		between different instances of the part, typically adjusted by
		using some hardware supported calibration procedure.

KernelVersion:	2.6.35

KernelVersion:	2.6.35
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Event generated when accel_x0 passes a threshold in correction direction
		(or stays beyond one). If direction isn't specified, either triggers it.
		Note driver will assume last p events requested are enabled where p is
		however many it supports.  So if you want to be sure you have
		set what you think you have, check the contents of these. Drivers
		may have to buffer any parameters so that they are consistent when a
		given event type is enabled a future point (and not those for whatever
		alarm was previously enabled).

What:		/sys/.../device[n]/buffer/scan_elements/accel[_x0]_type
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Description of the scan element data storage within the buffer
		and hence the form in which it is read from userspace.
		Form is [s|u]bits/storagebits.  s or u specifies if signed
		(2's complement) or unsigned. bits is the number of bits of
		data and storagebits is the space (after padding) that it
		occupies in the buffer.  Note that some devices will have
		additional information in the unused bits so to get a clean
		value, the bits value must be used to mask the buffer output
		value appropriately.  The storagebits value also specifies the
		data alignment.  So s48/64 will be a signed 48 bit integer
		stored in a 64 bit location aligned to a a64 bit boundary.
		For other storage combinations this attribute will be extended
		appropriately.

What:		/sys/.../device[n]/buffer/scan_elements/accel[_x0]_index
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		A single positive integer specifying the position of this
		scan element in the buffer. Note these are not dependant on
		what is enabled and may not be contiguous. Thus for userspace
		to establish the full layout these must be used in conjunction
		with all _en attributes to establish which channels are present,
		and the relevant _type attributes to establish the data storage
		format.

What:		/sys/.../device[n]/buffer/scan_elements/accel[_x0]_shift
KernelVersion:	2.6.37
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		A bit shift (to right) that must be applied prior to
		extracting the bits specified by accel[_x0]_precision.
