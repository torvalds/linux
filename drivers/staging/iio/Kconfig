	depends on !S390
	---help---
	  The industrial I/O subsystem provides a unified framework for
	  drivers for many different types of embedded sensors using a
	  number of different physical interfaces (i2c, spi etc). See
	  Documentation/industrialio for more information.

config IIO_RING_BUFFER
	bool "Enable ring buffer support within IIO"
	help
	  Provide core support for various ring buffer based data
	  acquisition methods.

config IIO_SW_RING
	tristate "Industrial I/O lock free software ring"
	help
	example software ring buffer implementation.  The design aim
	of this particular realization was to minize write locking
	with the intention that some devices would be able to write
	in interrupt context.

config IIO_TRIGGER
	boolean "Enable triggered sampling support"
	help
	  Provides IIO core support for triggers.  Currently these
	  are used to initialize capture of samples to push into
	  ring buffers.  The triggers are effectively a 'capture
	  data now' interrupt.
