Date:		March 2016
KernelVersion:	4.XX
Contact:	Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com>
Description:
		This file reflects the power state of a Greybus interface. If
		the value read from it is "on", then power is currently
		supplied to the interface. Otherwise it will read "off" and
		power is currently not supplied to the interface.

		If the value read is "off", then writing "on" (or '1', 'y',
		'Y') to this file will enable power to the interface and an
		attempt to boot and possibly enumerate it will be made. Note
		that on errors, the interface will again be powered down.

		If the value read is "on", then writing "off" (or '0', 'n',
		'N') to this file will power down the interface.

Description:
		A bundle has a state that is managed by the userspace
		Endo process.  This file allows that Endo to signal

		changed to a specific value.  When written to, any
		process watching the file will be woken up, and the new
		value can be read. It's a "poor-man's IPC", yes, but
		simplifies the Android userspace code immensely.
