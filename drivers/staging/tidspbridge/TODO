* Migrate to (and if necessary, extend) existing upstream code such as 
  iommu, wdt, mcbsp, gptimers
* Decouple hardware-specific code (e.g. bridge_brd_start/stop/delete/monitor)
* DOFF binary loader: consider pushing to user space. at the very least
  eliminate the direct filesystem access
* Eliminate general services and libraries - use or extend existing kernel
  libraries instead (e.g. gcf/lcm in nldr.c, global helpers in gen/)
* Eliminate direct manipulation of OMAP_SYSC_BASE
* Eliminate list.h : seem like a redundant wrapper to existing kernel lists
* Eliminate DSP_SUCCEEDED macros and their imposed redundant indentations
  (adopt the kernel way of checking for return values)
* Audit interfaces exposed to user space
* Audit and clean up header files folder
* Use kernel coding style
* checkpatch.pl fixes
* allocate ext_mem_pool from consistent memory instead of using ioremap
