I'm hesitant to add a TODO file here, as the wireless developers would
really have people help them out on the "clean" rt2860 driver that can
be found at the rt2860.sf.net site.

But, if you wish to clean up this driver instead, here's a short list of
things that need to be done to get it into a more mergable shape:

TODO:
	- checkpatch.pl clean
	- sparse clean
	- port to in-kernel 80211 stack
	- remove reading from /etc/ config files
	- review by the wireless developer community

Please send any patches or complaints about this driver to Greg
Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com> and don't bother the upstream wireless
kernel developers about it, they want nothing to do with it.
