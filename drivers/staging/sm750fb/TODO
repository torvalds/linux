TODO:
- lots of checkpatch cleanup
- use kernel coding style
- refine the code and remove unused code
- Implement hardware acceleration for imageblit if image->depth > 1
- check on hardware effects of removal of USE_HW_I2C and USE_DVICHIP (these two
	are supposed to be sample code which is given here if someone wants to
	use those functionalities)
- must be ported to the atomic kms framework in the drm subsystem (which will
  give you a basic fbdev driver for free)
