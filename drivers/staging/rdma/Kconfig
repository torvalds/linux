          This option allows you to select a number of RDMA drivers that
	  fall into one of two categories: deprecated drivers being held
	  here before finally being removed or new drivers that still need
	  some work before being moved to the normal RDMA driver area.

          If you wish to work on these drivers, to help improve them, or
          to report problems you have with them, please use the
	  linux-rdma@vger.kernel.org mailing list.

          If in doubt, say N here.
