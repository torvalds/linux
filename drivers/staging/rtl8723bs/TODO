TODO:
- find and remove any code for other chips that is left over
- convert any remaining unusual variable types
- checkpatch.pl fixes - most of the remaining ones are lines too long. Many
  of them will require refactoring
- merge Realtek's bugfixes and new features into the driver
- switch to use MAC80211
