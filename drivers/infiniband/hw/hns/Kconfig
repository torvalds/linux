	  This is a RoCE/RDMA driver for the Hisilicon RoCE engine. The engine
	  is used in Hisilicon Hip06 and more further ICT SoC based on
	  platform device.

	  To compile HIP06 or HIP08 driver as module, choose M here.

	  RoCE driver support for Hisilicon RoCE engine in Hisilicon Hip06 and
	  Hip07 SoC. These RoCE engines are platform devices.

	  To compile this driver, choose Y here: if INFINIBAND_HNS is m, this

	  RoCE driver support for Hisilicon RoCE engine in Hisilicon Hip08 SoC.
	  The RoCE engine is a PCI device.

	  To compile this driver, choose Y here: if INFINIBAND_HNS is m, this
	  module will be called hns-roce-hw-v2.
