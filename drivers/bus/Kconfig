	select ARM_CCI400_COMMON
	select ARM_CCI_PMU
	help
	  Support for PMU events monitoring on the ARM CCI-400 (cache coherent
	  interconnect). CCI-400 supports counting events related to the
	  connected slave/master interfaces.

config ARM_CCI400_PORT_CTRL
	bool
	depends on ARM && OF && CPU_V7
	select ARM_CCI400_COMMON
	help
	  Low level power management driver for CCI400 cache coherent
	  interconnect for ARM platforms.

	depends on (ARM && CPU_V7) || ARM64
	depends on PERF_EVENTS
	select ARM_CCI_PMU
	help
	  Support for PMU events monitoring on the ARM CCI-500/CCI-550 cache
	  coherent interconnects. Both of them provide 8 independent event counters,
	  which can count events pertaining to the slave/master interfaces as well
	  as the internal events to the CCI.

	  If unsure, say Y

config ARM_CCN
	tristate "ARM CCN driver support"
	depends on ARM || ARM64
	depends on PERF_EVENTS
	help
	  PMU (perf) driver supporting the ARM CCN (Cache Coherent Network)
	  interconnect.

config BRCMSTB_GISB_ARB
	bool "Broadcom STB GISB bus arbiter"
	depends on ARM || ARM64 || MIPS
	default ARCH_BRCMSTB || BMIPS_GENERIC
	help
	  Driver for the Broadcom Set Top Box System-on-a-chip internal bus
	  arbiter. This driver provides timeout and target abort error handling
	  and internal bus master decoding.

config IMX_WEIM
	bool "Freescale EIM DRIVER"
	depends on ARCH_MXC
	help
	  Driver for i.MX WEIM controller.
	  The WEIM(Wireless External Interface Module) works like a bus.
	  You can attach many different devices on it, such as NOR, onenand.

config MIPS_CDMM
	bool "MIPS Common Device Memory Map (CDMM) Driver"
	depends on CPU_MIPSR2
	help
	  Driver needed for the MIPS Common Device Memory Map bus in MIPS
	  cores. This bus is for per-CPU tightly coupled devices such as the
	  Fast Debug Channel (FDC).

	  For this to work, either your bootloader needs to enable the CDMM
	  region at an unused physical address on the boot CPU, or else your
	  platform code needs to implement mips_cdmm_phys_base() (see
	  asm/cdmm.h).

config MVEBU_MBUS
	bool
	depends on PLAT_ORION
	help
	  Driver needed for the MBus configuration on Marvell EBU SoCs
	  (Kirkwood, Dove, Orion5x, MV78XX0 and Armada 370/XP).

config OMAP_INTERCONNECT
	tristate "OMAP INTERCONNECT DRIVER"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS

	help
	  Driver to enable OMAP interconnect error handling driver.

config OMAP_OCP2SCP
	tristate "OMAP OCP2SCP DRIVER"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
	help
	  Driver to enable ocp2scp module which transforms ocp interface
	  protocol to scp protocol. In OMAP4, USB PHY is connected via
	  OCP2SCP and in OMAP5, both USB PHY and SATA PHY is connected via
	  OCP2SCP.

config QCOM_EBI2
	bool "Qualcomm External Bus Interface 2 (EBI2)"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST
	default ARCH_QCOM
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the Qualcomm External Bus
	  Interface 2, which can be used to connect things like NAND Flash,
	  SRAM, ethernet adapters, FPGAs and LCD displays.

config SIMPLE_PM_BUS
	bool "Simple Power-Managed Bus Driver"
	depends on OF && PM
	help
	  Driver for transparent busses that don't need a real driver, but
	  where the bus controller is part of a PM domain, or under the control
	  of a functional clock, and thus relies on runtime PM for managing
	  this PM domain and/or clock.
	  An example of such a bus controller is the Renesas Bus State
	  Controller (BSC, sometimes called "LBSC within Bus Bridge", or
	  "External Bus Interface") as found on several Renesas ARM SoCs.

config SUNXI_RSB
	tristate "Allwinner sunXi Reduced Serial Bus Driver"
	  default MACH_SUN8I || MACH_SUN9I
	  depends on ARCH_SUNXI
	  select REGMAP
	  help
	  Say y here to enable support for Allwinner's Reduced Serial Bus
	  (RSB) support. This controller is responsible for communicating
	  with various RSB based devices, such as AXP223, AXP8XX PMICs,
	  and AC100/AC200 ICs.

config TEGRA_ACONNECT
	tristate "Tegra ACONNECT Bus Driver"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA_210_SOC
	depends on OF && PM
	select PM_CLK
	help
	  Driver for the Tegra ACONNECT bus which is used to interface with
	  the devices inside the Audio Processing Engine (APE) for Tegra210.

config TEGRA_GMI
	tristate "Tegra Generic Memory Interface bus driver"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA
	help
	  Driver for the Tegra Generic Memory Interface bus which can be used
	  to attach devices such as NOR, UART, FPGA and more.

config UNIPHIER_SYSTEM_BUS
	tristate "UniPhier System Bus driver"
	depends on ARCH_UNIPHIER && OF
	default y
	help
	  Support for UniPhier System Bus, a simple external bus.  This is
	  needed to use on-board devices connected to UniPhier SoCs.

config VEXPRESS_CONFIG
	bool "Versatile Express configuration bus"
	default y if ARCH_VEXPRESS
	depends on ARM || ARM64
	depends on OF
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Platform configuration infrastructure for the ARM Ltd.
