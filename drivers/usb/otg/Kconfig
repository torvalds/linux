	  If you say yes here you get support for the Philips ISP1301
	  USB-On-The-Go transceiver working with the OMAP OTG controller.
	  The ISP1301 is a full speed USB  transceiver which is used in
	  products including H2, H3, and H4 development boards for Texas
	  Instruments OMAP processors.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called isp1301_omap.

	help
	  Enable this to support the USB OTG transceiver on TWL4030
	  family chips (including the TWL5030 and TPS659x0 devices).
	  This transceiver supports high and full speed devices plus,
	  in host mode, low speed.
