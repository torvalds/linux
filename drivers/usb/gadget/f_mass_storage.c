/*
 * The File-backed Storage Gadget acts as a USB Mass Storage device,
 * appearing to the host as a disk drive or as a CD-ROM drive.  In addition
 * to providing an example of a genuinely useful gadget driver for a USB
 * device, it also illustrates a technique of double-buffering for increased
 * throughput.  Last but not least, it gives an easy way to probe the
 * behavior of the Mass Storage drivers in a USB host.
 *
 * Backing storage is provided by a regular file or a block device, specified
 * by the "file" module parameter.  Access can be limited to read-only by
 * setting the optional "ro" module parameter.  (For CD-ROM emulation,
 * access is always read-only.)  The gadget will indicate that it has
 * removable media if the optional "removable" module parameter is set.
 *
 * There is support for multiple logical units (LUNs), each of which has
 * its own backing file.  The number of LUNs can be set using the optional
 * "luns" module parameter (anywhere from 1 to 8), and the corresponding
 * files are specified using comma-separated lists for "file" and "ro".
 * The default number of LUNs is taken from the number of "file" elements;
 * it is 1 if "file" is not given.  If "removable" is not set then a backing
 * file must be specified for each LUN.  If it is set, then an unspecified
 * or empty backing filename means the LUN's medium is not loaded.  Ideally
 * each LUN would be settable independently as a disk drive or a CD-ROM
 * drive, but currently all LUNs have to be the same type.  The CD-ROM
 * emulation includes a single data track and no audio tracks; hence there
 * need be only one backing file per LUN.  Note also that the CD-ROM block
 * length is set to 512 rather than the more common value 2048.
 *
 * Requirements are modest; only a bulk-in and a bulk-out endpoint are
 * needed (an interrupt-out endpoint is also needed for CBI).  The memory
 * requirement amounts to two 16K buffers, size configurable by a parameter.
 * Support is included for both full-speed and high-speed operation.
 *
 * Note that the driver is slightly non-portable in that it assumes a
 * single memory/DMA buffer will be useable for bulk-in, bulk-out, and
 * interrupt-in endpoints.  With most device controllers this isn't an
 * issue, but there may be some with hardware restrictions that prevent
 * a buffer from being used by more than one endpoint.
 *
 * Module options:
 *
 *	file=filename[,filename...]
 *				Required if "removable" is not set, names of
 *					the files or block devices used for
 *					backing storage
 *	ro=b[,b...]		Default false, booleans for read-only access
 *	removable		Default false, boolean for removable media
 *	luns=N			Default N = number of filenames, number of
 *					LUNs to support
 *	stall			Default determined according to the type of
 *					USB device controller (usually true),
 *					boolean to permit the driver to halt
 *					bulk endpoints
 *	cdrom			Default false, boolean for whether to emulate
 *					a CD-ROM drive
 *
 * The pathnames of the backing files and the ro settings are available in
 * the attribute files "file" and "ro" in the lun<n> subdirectory of the
 * gadget's sysfs directory.  If the "removable" option is set, writing to
 * these files will simulate ejecting/loading the medium (writing an empty
 * line means eject) and adjusting a write-enable tab.  Changes to the ro
 * setting are not allowed when the medium is loaded or if CD-ROM emulation
 * is being used.
 *
 * This gadget driver is heavily based on "Gadget Zero" by David Brownell.
 * The driver's SCSI command interface was based on the "Information
 * technology - Small Computer System Interface - 2" document from
 * X3T9.2 Project 375D, Revision 10L, 7-SEP-93, available at
 * <http://www.t10.org/ftp/t10/drafts/s2/s2-r10l.pdf>.  The single exception
 * is opcode 0x23 (READ FORMAT CAPACITIES), which was based on the
 * "Universal Serial Bus Mass Storage Class UFI Command Specification"
 * document, Revision 1.0, December 14, 1998, available at
 * <http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/usbmass-ufi10.pdf>.

/*
 *				Driver Design
 *
 * The FSG driver is fairly straightforward.  There is a main kernel
 * thread that handles most of the work.  Interrupt routines field
 * callbacks from the controller driver: bulk- and interrupt-request
 * completion notifications, endpoint-0 events, and disconnect events.
 * Completion events are passed to the main thread by wakeup calls.  Many
 * ep0 requests are handled at interrupt time, but SetInterface,
 * SetConfiguration, and device reset requests are forwarded to the
 * thread in the form of "exceptions" using SIGUSR1 signals (since they
 * should interrupt any ongoing file I/O operations).
 *
 * The thread's main routine implements the standard command/data/status
 * parts of a SCSI interaction.  It and its subroutines are full of tests
 * for pending signals/exceptions -- all this polling is necessary since
 * the kernel has no setjmp/longjmp equivalents.  (Maybe this is an
 * indication that the driver really wants to be running in userspace.)
 * An important point is that so long as the thread is alive it keeps an
 * open reference to the backing file.  This will prevent unmounting
 * the backing file's underlying filesystem and could cause problems
 * during system shutdown, for example.  To prevent such problems, the
 * thread catches INT, TERM, and KILL signals and converts them into
 * an EXIT exception.
 *
 * In normal operation the main thread is started during the gadget's
 * fsg_bind() callback and stopped during fsg_unbind().  But it can also
 * exit when it receives a signal, and there's no point leaving the
 * gadget running when the thread is dead.  So just before the thread
 * exits, it deregisters the gadget driver.  This makes things a little
 * tricky: The driver is deregistered at two places, and the exiting
 * thread can indirectly call fsg_unbind() which in turn can tell the
 * thread to exit.  The first problem is resolved through the use of the
 * REGISTERED atomic bitflag; the driver will only be deregistered once.
 * The second problem is resolved by having fsg_unbind() check
 * fsg->state; it won't try to stop the thread if the state is already
 * FSG_STATE_TERMINATED.
 *
 * To provide maximum throughput, the driver uses a circular pipeline of
 * buffer heads (struct fsg_buffhd).  In principle the pipeline can be
 * arbitrarily long; in practice the benefits don't justify having more
 * than 2 stages (i.e., double buffering).  But it helps to think of the
 * pipeline as being a long one.  Each buffer head contains a bulk-in and
 * a bulk-out request pointer (since the buffer can be used for both
 * output and input -- directions always are given from the host's
 * point of view) as well as a pointer to the buffer and various state
 * variables.
 *
 * Use of the pipeline follows a simple protocol.  There is a variable
 * (fsg->next_buffhd_to_fill) that points to the next buffer head to use.
 * At any time that buffer head may still be in use from an earlier
 * request, so each buffer head has a state variable indicating whether
 * it is EMPTY, FULL, or BUSY.  Typical use involves waiting for the
 * buffer head to be EMPTY, filling the buffer either by file I/O or by
 * USB I/O (during which the buffer head is BUSY), and marking the buffer
 * head FULL when the I/O is complete.  Then the buffer will be emptied
 * (again possibly by USB I/O, during which it is marked BUSY) and
 * finally marked EMPTY again (possibly by a completion routine).
 *
 * A module parameter tells the driver to avoid stalling the bulk
 * endpoints wherever the transport specification allows.  This is
 * necessary for some UDCs like the SuperH, which cannot reliably clear a
 * halt on a bulk endpoint.  However, under certain circumstances the
 * Bulk-only specification requires a stall.  In such cases the driver
 * will halt the endpoint and set a flag indicating that it should clear
 * the halt in software during the next device reset.  Hopefully this
 * will permit everything to work correctly.  Furthermore, although the
 * specification allows the bulk-out endpoint to halt when the host sends
 * too much data, implementing this would cause an unavoidable race.
 * The driver will always use the "no-stall" approach for OUT transfers.
 *
 * One subtle point concerns sending status-stage responses for ep0
 * requests.  Some of these requests, such as device reset, can involve
 * interrupting an ongoing file I/O operation, which might take an
 * arbitrarily long time.  During that delay the host might give up on
 * the original ep0 request and issue a new one.  When that happens the
 * driver should not notify the host about completion of the original
 * request, as the host will no longer be waiting for it.  So the driver
 * assigns to each ep0 request a unique tag, and it keeps track of the
 * tag value of the request associated with a long-running exception
 * (device-reset, interface-change, or configuration-change).  When the
 * exception handler is finished, the status-stage response is submitted
 * only if the current ep0 request tag is equal to the exception request
 * tag.  Thus only the most recently received ep0 request will get a
 * status-stage response.
 *
 * Warning: This driver source file is too long.  It ought to be split up
 * into a header file plus about 3 separate .c files, to handle the details
 * of the Gadget, USB Mass Storage, and SCSI protocols.
