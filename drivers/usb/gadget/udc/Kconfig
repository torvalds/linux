#
# USB Gadget support on a system involves
#    (a) a peripheral controller, and
#    (b) the gadget driver using it.
#
# NOTE:  Gadget support ** DOES NOT ** depend on host-side CONFIG_USB !!
#
#  - Host systems (like PCs) need CONFIG_USB (with "A" jacks).
#  - Peripherals (like PDAs) need CONFIG_USB_GADGET (with "B" jacks).
#  - Some systems have both kinds of controllers.
#
# With help from a special transceiver and a "Mini-AB" jack, systems with
# both kinds of controller can also support "USB On-the-Go" (CONFIG_USB_OTG).
#

#
# USB Peripheral Controller Support
#
# The order here is alphabetical, except that integrated controllers go
# before discrete ones so they will be the initial/default value:
#   - integrated/SOC controllers first
#   - licensed IP used in both SOC and discrete versions
#   - discrete ones (including all PCI-only controllers)
#   - debug/dummy gadget+hcd is last.

	  This host controller driver emulates USB, looping all data transfer

	  This may help in some stages of creating a driver to embed in a
	  Linux device, since it lets you debug several parts of the gadget
	  driver without its hardware or drivers being involved.
