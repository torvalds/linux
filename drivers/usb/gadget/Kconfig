# USB Gadget support on a system involves
#    (a) a peripheral controller, and
#    (b) the gadget driver using it.
#
# NOTE:  Gadget support ** DOES NOT ** depend on host-side CONFIG_USB !!
#
#  - Host systems (like PCs) need CONFIG_USB (with "A" jacks).
#  - Peripherals (like PDAs) need CONFIG_USB_GADGET (with "B" jacks).
#  - Some systems have both kinds of controllers.
#
# With help from a special transceiver and a "Mini-AB" jack, systems with
# both kinds of controller can also support "USB On-the-Go" (CONFIG_USB_OTG).

	select NLS
	help
	   USB is a master/slave protocol, organized with one master
	   host (such as a PC) controlling up to 127 peripheral devices.
	   The USB hardware is asymmetric, which makes it easier to set up:
	   you can't connect a "to-the-host" connector to a peripheral.

	   Linux can run in the host, or in the peripheral.  In both cases
	   you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software
	   talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon,
	   or are integrated with the CPU in a microcontroller.  The more
	   familiar host side controllers have names like "EHCI", "OHCI",
	   or "UHCI", and are usually integrated into southbridges on PC
	   motherboards.

	   Enable this configuration option if you want to run Linux inside
	   a USB peripheral device.  Configure one hardware driver for your
	   peripheral/device side bus controller, and a "gadget driver" for
	   your peripheral protocol.  (If you use modular gadget drivers,
	   you may configure more than one.)

	   If in doubt, say "N" and don't enable these drivers; most people
	   don't have this kind of hardware (except maybe inside Linux PDAs).

	   For more information, see <http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget> and
	   the kernel DocBook documentation for this API.

	   Many controller and gadget drivers will print some debugging
	   messages if you use this option to ask for those messages.

	   Avoid enabling these messages, even if you're actively

	   Some devices need to draw power from USB when they are
	   configured, perhaps to operate circuitry or to recharge
	   batteries.  This is in addition to any local power supply,
	   such as an AC adapter or batteries.

	   Enter the maximum power your device draws through USB, in
	   milliAmperes.  The permitted range of values is 2 - 500 mA;
	   0 mA would be legal, but can make some hosts misbehave.

	   This value will be used except for system-specific gadget
	   drivers that have more specific information.

config USB_GADGET_STORAGE_NUM_BUFFERS
	int "Number of storage pipeline buffers"
	range 2 4
	default 2
	help
	   Usually 2 buffers are enough to establish a good buffering
	   pipeline. The number may be increased in order to compensate
	   for a bursty VFS behaviour. For instance there may be CPU wake up
	   latencies that makes the VFS to appear bursty in a system with
	   an CPU on-demand governor. Especially if DMA is doing IO to
	   offload the CPU. In this case the CPU will go into power
	   save often and spin up occasionally to move data within VFS.
	   If selecting USB_GADGET_DEBUG_FILES this value may be set by
	   a module parameter as well.
	   If unsure, say 2.

	  The Mass Storage Gadget acts as a USB Mass Storage disk drive.
	  As its storage repository it can use a regular file or a block
	  device (in much the same way as the "loop" device driver),
	  specified as a module parameter or sysfs option.

	  Loopback function loops back a configurable number of transfers.
	  Sourcesink function either sinks and sources bulk data.
	  It also implements control requests, for "chapter 9" conformance.
	  Make this be the first driver you try using on top of any new
	  USB peripheral controller driver.  Then you can use host-side
	  test software, like the "usbtest" driver, to put your hardware
	  and its driver through a basic set of functional tests.

config USB_CONFIGFS_F_FS
	boolean "Function filesystem (FunctionFS)"
	depends on USB_CONFIGFS
	select USB_F_FS
	help
	  The Function Filesystem (FunctionFS) lets one create USB
	  composite functions in user space in the same way GadgetFS
	  lets one create USB gadgets in user space.  This allows creation
	  of composite gadgets such that some of the functions are
	  implemented in kernel space (for instance Ethernet, serial or
	  mass storage) and other are implemented in user space.
