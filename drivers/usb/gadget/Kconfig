# USB Gadget support on a system involves
#    (a) a peripheral controller, and
#    (b) the gadget driver using it.
#
# NOTE:  Gadget support ** DOES NOT ** depend on host-side CONFIG_USB !!
#
#  - Host systems (like PCs) need CONFIG_USB (with "A" jacks).
#  - Peripherals (like PDAs) need CONFIG_USB_GADGET (with "B" jacks).
#  - Some systems have both kinds of controllers.
#
# With help from a special transceiver and a "Mini-AB" jack, systems with
# both kinds of controller can also support "USB On-the-Go" (CONFIG_USB_OTG).

	tristate "USB Gadget Support"
	help
	   USB is a master/slave protocol, organized with one master
	   host (such as a PC) controlling up to 127 peripheral devices.
	   The USB hardware is asymmetric, which makes it easier to set up:
	   you can't connect a "to-the-host" connector to a peripheral.

	   Linux can run in the host, or in the peripheral.  In both cases
	   you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software
	   talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon,
	   or are integrated with the CPU in a microcontroller.  The more
	   familiar host side controllers have names like "EHCI", "OHCI",
	   or "UHCI", and are usually integrated into southbridges on PC
	   motherboards.

	   Enable this configuration option if you want to run Linux inside
	   a USB peripheral device.  Configure one hardware driver for your
	   peripheral/device side bus controller, and a "gadget driver" for
	   your peripheral protocol.  (If you use modular gadget drivers,
	   you may configure more than one.)

	   If in doubt, say "N" and don't enable these drivers; most people
	   don't have this kind of hardware (except maybe inside Linux PDAs).

	   For more information, see <http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget> and
	   the kernel DocBook documentation for this API.

	  and its driver through a basic set of functional tests.

	  Gadget Zero also works with the host-side "usb-skeleton" driver,

	  driver, so that deep I/O queues can be supported.  On 2.4 kernels,
