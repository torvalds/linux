#
# USB Gadget support on a system involves
#    (a) a peripheral controller, and
#    (b) the gadget driver using it.
#
# NOTE:  Gadget support ** DOES NOT ** depend on host-side CONFIG_USB !!
#
#  - Host systems (like PCs) need CONFIG_USB (with "A" jacks).
#  - Peripherals (like PDAs) need CONFIG_USB_GADGET (with "B" jacks).
#  - Some systems have both kinds of controllers.
#
# With help from a special transceiver and a "Mini-AB" jack, systems with
# both kinds of controller can also support "USB On-the-Go" (CONFIG_USB_OTG).

	help
	  Gadget Zero is a two-configuration device.  It either sinks and
	  sources bulk data; or it loops back a configurable number of
	  transfers.  It also implements control requests, for "chapter 9"
	  conformance.  The driver needs only two bulk-capable endpoints, so
	  it can work on top of most device-side usb controllers.  It's
	  useful for testing, and is also a working example showing how
	  USB "gadget drivers" can be written.

	  Make this be the first driver you try using on top of any new
	  USB peripheral controller driver.  Then you can use host-side
	  test software, like the "usbtest" driver, to put your hardware
	  and its driver through a basic set of functional tests.

	  Gadget Zero also works with the host-side "usb-skeleton" driver,
	  and with many kinds of host-side test software.  You may need
	  to tweak product and vendor IDs before host software knows about
	  this device, and arrange to select an appropriate configuration.

	  This driver implements Ethernet style communication, in one of
	  several ways:

	   - The "Communication Device Class" (CDC) Ethernet Control Model.
	     That protocol is often avoided with pure Ethernet adapters, in
	     favor of simpler vendor-specific hardware, but is widely
	     supported by firmware for smart network devices.

	   - On hardware can't implement that protocol, a simple CDC subset
	     is used, placing fewer demands on USB.

	   - CDC Ethernet Emulation Model (EEM) is a newer standard that has
	     a simpler interface that can be used by more USB hardware.

	  RNDIS support is an additional option, more demanding than than
	  subset.

	  Within the USB device, this gadget driver exposes a network device
	  "usbX", where X depends on what other networking devices you have.
	  Treat it like a two-node Ethernet link:  host, and gadget.

	  The Linux-USB host-side "usbnet" driver interoperates with this
	  driver, so that deep I/O queues can be supported.  On 2.4 kernels,
	  use "CDCEther" instead, if you're using the CDC option. That CDC
	  mode should also interoperate with standard CDC Ethernet class
	  drivers on other host operating systems.

       help
         CDC EEM is a newer USB standard that is somewhat simpler than CDC ECM
         and therefore can be supported by more hardware.  Technically ECM and
         EEM are designed for different applications.  The ECM model extends
         the network interface to the target (e.g. a USB cable modem), and the
         EEM model is for mobile devices to communicate with hosts using
         ethernet over USB.  For Linux gadgets, however, the interface with
         the host is the same (a usbX device), so the differences are minimal.

         If you say "y" here, the Ethernet gadget driver will use the EEM
