config USB_SERIAL
	tristate "USB Serial Converter support"
	depends on USB
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have a USB device that provides normal serial
	  ports, or acts like a serial device, and you want to connect it to
	  your USB bus.

	  Please read <file:Documentation/usb/usb-serial.txt> for more
	  information on the specifics of the different devices that are
	  supported, and on how to use them.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called usbserial.

config USB_SERIAL_CONSOLE
	bool "USB Serial Console device support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB_SERIAL=y && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a USB to serial
	  converter port as the system console (the system console is the
	  device which receives all kernel messages and warnings and which
	  allows logins in single user mode). This could be useful if some
	  terminal or printer is connected to that serial port.

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=ttyUSB0". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
	  kernel at boot time.)

	  If you don't have a VGA card installed and you say Y here, the
	  kernel will automatically use the first USB to serial converter
	  port, /dev/ttyUSB0, as system console.

	  If unsure, say N.
