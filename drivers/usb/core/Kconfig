config USB_DEBUG
	bool "USB verbose debug messages"
	depends on USB
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the USB core & hub drivers to produce a bunch
	  of debug messages to the system log. Select this if you are having a
	  problem with USB support and want to see more of what is going on.

config USB_DEVICEFS
	bool "USB device filesystem"
	depends on USB
	---help---
	  If you say Y here (and to "/proc file system support" in the "File
	  systems" section, above), you will get a file /proc/bus/usb/devices
	  which lists the devices currently connected to your USB bus or
	  busses, and for every connected device a file named
	  "/proc/bus/usb/xxx/yyy", where xxx is the bus number and yyy the
	  device number; the latter files can be used by user space programs
	  to talk directly to the device. These files are "virtual", meaning
	  they are generated on the fly and not stored on the hard drive.

	  You may need to mount the usbfs file system to see the files, use
	  mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb

	  For the format of the various /proc/bus/usb/ files, please read
	  <file:Documentation/usb/proc_usb_info.txt>.

	  Please note that this code is completely unrelated to devfs, the
	  "/dev file system support".

	  Most users want to say Y here.

config USB_BANDWIDTH
	bool "Enforce USB bandwidth allocation (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say Y here, the USB subsystem enforces USB bandwidth
	  allocation and will prevent some device opens from succeeding
	  if they would cause USB bandwidth usage to go above 90% of
	  the bus bandwidth.

	  If you say N here, these conditions will cause warning messages
	  about USB bandwidth usage to be logged and some devices or
	  drivers may not work correctly.

config USB_DYNAMIC_MINORS
	bool "Dynamic USB minor allocation (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say Y here, the USB subsystem will use dynamic minor
	  allocation for any device that uses the USB major number.
	  This means that you can have more than 16 of a single type
	  of device (like USB printers).

	  If you are unsure about this, say N here.

config USB_SUSPEND
	bool "USB selective suspend/resume and wakeup (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB && PM && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say Y here, you can use driver calls or the sysfs
	  "power/state" file to suspend or resume individual USB
	  peripherals.

	  Also, USB "remote wakeup" signaling is supported, whereby some
	  USB devices (like keyboards and network adapters) can wake up
	  their parent hub.  That wakeup cascades up the USB tree, and
	  could wake the system from states like suspend-to-RAM.

	  If you are unsure about this, say N here.


config USB_OTG
	bool
	depends on USB && EXPERIMENTAL
	select USB_SUSPEND
	default n


config USB_OTG_WHITELIST
	bool "Rely on OTG Targeted Peripherals List"
	depends on USB_OTG
	default y
	help
	  If you say Y here, the "otg_whitelist.h" file will be used as a
	  product whitelist, so USB peripherals not listed there will be
	  rejected during enumeration.  This behavior is required by the
	  USB OTG specification for all devices not on your product's
	  "Targeted Peripherals List".

	  Otherwise, peripherals not listed there will only generate a
	  warning and enumeration will continue.  That's more like what
	  normal Linux-USB hosts do (other than the warning), and is
	  convenient for many stages of product development.
