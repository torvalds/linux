	help
	  The Cypress C67x00 (EZ-Host/EZ-OTG) chips are dual-role
	  host/peripheral/OTG USB controllers.

	  Enable this option to support this chip in host controller mode.
	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called c67x00.

config USB_XHCI_HCD
	tristate "xHCI HCD (USB 3.0) support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB && PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  The eXtensible Host Controller Interface (xHCI) is standard for USB 3.0
	  "SuperSpeed" host controller hardware.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called xhci-hcd.

config USB_XHCI_HCD_DEBUGGING
	bool "Debugging for the xHCI host controller"
	depends on USB_XHCI_HCD
	---help---
	  Say 'Y' to turn on debugging for the xHCI host controller driver.
	  This will spew debugging output, even in interrupt context.
	  This should only be used for debugging xHCI driver bugs.

	  If unsure, say N.

config USB_EHCI_HCD
	tristate "EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support"
	depends on USB && USB_ARCH_HAS_EHCI
	---help---
	  The Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) is standard for USB 2.0
	  "high speed" (480 Mbit/sec, 60 Mbyte/sec) host controller hardware.
	  If your USB host controller supports USB 2.0, you will likely want to
	  configure this Host Controller Driver.

	  EHCI controllers are packaged with "companion" host controllers (OHCI
	  or UHCI) to handle USB 1.1 devices connected to root hub ports.  Ports
	  will connect to EHCI if the device is high speed, otherwise they
	  connect to a companion controller.  If you configure EHCI, you should
	  probably configure the OHCI (for NEC and some other vendors) USB Host
	  Controller Driver or UHCI (for Via motherboards) Host Controller
	  Driver too.

	  You may want to read <file:Documentation/usb/ehci.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ehci-hcd.

config USB_EHCI_ROOT_HUB_TT
	bool "Root Hub Transaction Translators"
	depends on USB_EHCI_HCD
	---help---
	  Some EHCI chips have vendor-specific extensions to integrate
	  transaction translators, so that no OHCI or UHCI companion
	  controller is needed.  It's safe to say "y" even if your
	  controller doesn't support this feature.

	  This supports the EHCI implementation that's originally
	  from ARC, and has since changed hands a few times.

config USB_EHCI_TT_NEWSCHED
	bool "Improved Transaction Translator scheduling"
	depends on USB_EHCI_HCD
	default y
	---help---
	  This changes the periodic scheduling code to fill more of the low
	  and full speed bandwidth available from the Transaction Translator
	  (TT) in USB 2.0 hubs.  Without this, only one transfer will be
	  issued in each microframe, significantly reducing the number of
	  periodic low/fullspeed transfers possible.

	  If you have multiple periodic low/fullspeed devices connected to a
	  highspeed USB hub which is connected to a highspeed USB Host
	  Controller, and some of those devices will not work correctly
	  (possibly due to "ENOSPC" or "-28" errors), say Y.  Conversely, if
	  you have only one such device and it doesn't work, you could try
	  saying N.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  USB controller from Intel or VIA, this is appropriate.  If your host
	  controller doesn't use PCI, this is probably appropriate.  For a PCI
	  based system where you're not sure, the "lspci -v" entry will list the

	  The U132 adapter is a USB to CardBus adapter specifically designed

	  The driver consists of two modules, the "ftdi-elan" module is a
	  USB client driver that interfaces to the FTDI chip within ELAN's
	  USB-to-PCMCIA adapter, and this "u132-hcd" module is a USB host
	  controller driver that talks to the OHCI controller within the
