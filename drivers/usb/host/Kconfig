	---help---
	  The Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) is standard for USB 2.0
	  "high speed" (480 Mbit/sec, 60 Mbyte/sec) host controller hardware.
	  If your USB host controller supports USB 2.0, you will likely want to
	  configure this Host Controller Driver.

	  EHCI controllers are packaged with "companion" host controllers (OHCI
	  or UHCI) to handle USB 1.1 devices connected to root hub ports.  Ports
	  will connect to EHCI if the device is high speed, otherwise they
	  connect to a companion controller.  If you configure EHCI, you should
	  probably configure the OHCI (for NEC and some other vendors) USB Host
	  Controller Driver or UHCI (for Via motherboards) Host Controller
	  Driver too.

	  You may want to read <file:Documentation/usb/ehci.txt>.

	  Some EHCI chips have vendor-specific extensions to integrate
	  transaction translators, so that no OHCI or UHCI companion
	  controller is needed.  It's safe to say "y" even if your
	  controller doesn't support this feature.

	  periodic low/fullspeed transfers possible.

	  If you have multiple periodic low/fullspeed devices connected to a

	  Controller, and some of those devices will not work correctly
