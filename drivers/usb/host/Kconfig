	---help---
	  The Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) is standard for USB 2.0
	  "high speed" (480 Mbit/sec, 60 Mbyte/sec) host controller hardware.
	  If your USB host controller supports USB 2.0, you will likely want to
	  configure this Host Controller Driver.

	  EHCI controllers are packaged with "companion" host controllers (OHCI
	  or UHCI) to handle USB 1.1 devices connected to root hub ports.  Ports
	  will connect to EHCI if the device is high speed, otherwise they
	  connect to a companion controller.  If you configure EHCI, you should
	  probably configure the OHCI (for NEC and some other vendors) USB Host
	  Controller Driver or UHCI (for Via motherboards) Host Controller
	  Driver too.

	  You may want to read <file:Documentation/usb/ehci.txt>.

	---help---
	  Some EHCI chips have vendor-specific extensions to integrate
	  transaction translators, so that no OHCI or UHCI companion
	  controller is needed.  It's safe to say "y" even if your
	  controller doesn't support this feature.

	  This supports the EHCI implementation that's originally
	  from ARC, and has since changed hands a few times.

	  (TT) in USB 2.0 hubs.  Without this, only one transfer will be
	  issued in each microframe, significantly reducing the number of
	  periodic low/fullspeed transfers possible.

	  If you have multiple periodic low/fullspeed devices connected to a
	  highspeed USB hub which is connected to a highspeed USB Host
	  Controller, and some of those devices will not work correctly
	  (possibly due to "ENOSPC" or "-28" errors), say Y.  Conversely, if

	  the PCCARD. A rather pointless thing to do, but useful for testing.

	  It is safe to say M here.

config USB_SL811_HCD
	tristate "SL811HS HCD support"
	help
	  The SL811HS is a single-port USB controller that supports either
	  host side or peripheral side roles.  Enable this option if your
	  board has this chip, and you want to use it as a host controller. 
	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called sl811-hcd.

config USB_SL811_HCD_ISO
	bool "partial ISO support"
	depends on USB_SL811_HCD
	help
	  The driver doesn't support iso_frame_desc (yet), but for some simple
	  devices that just queue one ISO frame per URB, then ISO transfers
	  "should" work using the normal urb status fields.

	  If unsure, say N.

config USB_HCD_TEST_MODE
	bool "HCD test mode support"
	---help---
	  Say 'Y' to enable additional software test modes that may be
	  supported by the host controller drivers.

	  One such test mode is the Embedded High-speed Host Electrical Test
	  (EHSET) for EHCI host controller hardware, specifically the "Single
	  Step Set Feature" test.  Typically this will be enabled for On-the-Go
	  or embedded hosts that need to undergo USB-IF compliance testing with
	  the aid of special testing hardware.  In the future, this may expand
	  to include other tests that require support from a HCD driver.

	  This option is of interest only to developers who need to validate
	  their USB hardware designs.  It is not needed for normal use.  If
	  unsure, say N.
