config USB_HID
	tristate "USB Human Interface Device (full HID) support"
	depends on USB
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want full HID support to connect keyboards,
	  mice, joysticks, graphic tablets, or any other HID based devices
	  to your computer via USB. You also need to select HID Input layer
	  support (below) if you want to use keyboards, mice, joysticks and
	  the like ... as well as Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) and
	  monitor control devices.

	  You can't use this driver and the HIDBP (Boot Protocol) keyboard
	  and mouse drivers at the same time. More information is available:
	  <file:Documentation/input/input.txt>.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called usbhid.

	depends on USB_HIDINPUT && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Say Y here is you want force feedback support for a few HID devices.
	  See below for a list of supported devices.

	  See <file:Documentation/input/ff.txt> for a description of the force
	  feedback API.

	  If unsure, say N.

	depends on HID_FF
	help
	  Say Y here if you have one of these devices:
	  - Logitech WingMan Cordless RumblePad
	  - Logitech WingMan Force 3D
	  and if you want to enable force feedback for them.
	  Note: if you say N here, this device will still be supported, but without
	  force feedback.

config THRUSTMASTER_FF

	depends on USB_HID
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support HID devices (from the USB
	  specification standpoint) that aren't strictly user interface
	  devices, like monitor controls and Uninterruptable Power Supplies.

	  This module supports these devices separately using a separate
	  event interface on /dev/usb/hiddevX (char 180:96 to 180:111).

	depends on USB && INPUT
	---help---
	  Say Y here only if you are absolutely sure that you don't want
	  to use the generic HID driver for your USB keyboard and prefer
	  to use the keyboard in its limited Boot Protocol mode instead.

	  This is almost certainly not what you want.  This is mostly
	  useful for embedded applications or simple keyboards.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called usbkbd.

	  If even remotely unsure, say N.

	  The X10 "Lola" remote is available at:
	     <http://www.x10.com/products/lola_sg1.htm>
	  This driver provides mouse pointer, left and right mouse buttons, 
	  and maps all the other remote buttons to keypress events.

config USB_KEYSPAN_REMOTE
	tristate "Keyspan DMR USB remote control (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB && INPUT && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to use a Keyspan DMR USB remote control.
	  Currently only the UIA-11 type of receiver has been tested.  The tag
	  on the receiver that connects to the USB port should have a P/N that
	  will tell you what type of DMR you have.  The UIA-10 type is not
	  supported at this time.  This driver maps all buttons to keypress
	  events.

	  These are the touchpads that can be found on post-February 2005
	  Apple Powerbooks (prior models have a Synaptics touchpad connected
	  to the ADB bus).

	  This driver provides a basic mouse driver but can be interfaced
	  with the synaptics X11 driver to provide acceleration and
	  scrolling in X11.

	  For further information, see
	  <file:Documentation/input/appletouch.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called appletouch.
