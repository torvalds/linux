menuconfig PCCARD
	tristate "PCCard (PCMCIA/CardBus) support"
	depends on HOTPLUG
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to attach PCMCIA- or PC-cards to your Linux
	  computer.  These are credit-card size devices such as network cards,
	  modems or hard drives often used with laptops computers.  There are
	  actually two varieties of these cards: 16 bit PCMCIA and 32 bit
	  CardBus cards.

	  To compile this driver as modules, choose M here: the
	  module will be called pcmcia_core.

if PCCARD

config PCMCIA
	tristate "16-bit PCMCIA support"
	select CRC32
	default y
	---help---
	   This option enables support for 16-bit PCMCIA cards. Most older
	   PC-cards are such 16-bit PCMCIA cards, so unless you know you're
	   only using 32-bit CardBus cards, say Y or M here.

	   To use 16-bit PCMCIA cards, you will need supporting software in
	   most cases. (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes> for
	   location and details).

	   To compile this driver as modules, choose M here: the
	   module will be called pcmcia.

	   If unsure, say Y.

config PCMCIA_LOAD_CIS
	bool "Load CIS updates from userspace (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PCMCIA && EXPERIMENTAL
	select FW_LOADER
	default y
	help
	  Some PCMCIA cards require an updated Card Information Structure (CIS)
	  to be loaded from userspace to work correctly. If you say Y here,
	  and your userspace is arranged correctly, this will be loaded
	  automatically using the in-kernel firmware loader and the hotplug
	  subsystem, instead of relying on cardmgr from pcmcia-cs to do so.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config PCMCIA_IOCTL
	bool "PCMCIA control ioctl (obsolete)"
	depends on PCMCIA
	default y
	help
	  If you say Y here, the deprecated ioctl interface to the PCMCIA
	  subsystem will be built. It is needed by cardmgr and cardctl
	  (pcmcia-cs) to function properly.

	  You should use the new pcmciautils package instead (see
	  <file:Documentation/Changes> for location and details).

	  If unsure, say Y.

config CARDBUS
	bool "32-bit CardBus support"
	depends on PCI
	default y
	---help---
	  CardBus is a bus mastering architecture for PC-cards, which allows
	  for 32 bit PC-cards (the original PCMCIA standard specifies only
	  a 16 bit wide bus). Many newer PC-cards are actually CardBus cards.

	  To use 32 bit PC-cards, you also need a CardBus compatible host
	  bridge. Virtually all modern PCMCIA bridges do this, and most of
	  them are "yenta-compatible", so say Y or M there, too.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config YENTA

	---help---
	  This option enables support for CardBus host bridges.  Virtually
	  all modern PCMCIA bridges are CardBus compatible.  A "bridge" is
	  the hardware inside your computer that PCMCIA cards are plugged
	  into.

	  To compile this driver as modules, choose M here: the
	  module will be called yenta_socket.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	depends on PCMCIA && ISA
	select PCCARD_NONSTATIC
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for ISA-bus PCMCIA host bridges that
	  are register compatible with the Intel i82365.  These are found on
	  older laptops and ISA-bus card readers for desktop systems.  A
	  "bridge" is the hardware inside your computer that PCMCIA cards are
	  plugged into. If unsure, say N.

config TCIC
	tristate "Databook TCIC host bridge support"
	depends on PCMCIA && ISA
	select PCCARD_NONSTATIC
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for the Databook TCIC family of PCMCIA
	  host bridges. These are only found on a handful of old systems.
