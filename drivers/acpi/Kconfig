	  Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) support for 
	  Linux requires an ACPI-compliant platform (hardware/firmware),
	  and assumes the presence of OS-directed configuration and power
	  management (OSPM) software.  This option will enlarge your 
	  kernel by about 70K.

	  Linux ACPI provides a robust functional replacement for several 
	  legacy configuration and power management interfaces, including
	  the Plug-and-Play BIOS specification (PnP BIOS), the 
	  MultiProcessor Specification (MPS), and the Advanced Power 
	  Management (APM) specification.  If both ACPI and APM support 
	  are configured, ACPI is used.

	  The project home page for the Linux ACPI subsystem is here:
	  <http://www.lesswatts.org/projects/acpi/>

	  Linux support for ACPI is based on Intel Corporation's ACPI
	  Component Architecture (ACPI CA).  For more information on the
	  ACPI CA, see:
	  <http://acpica.org/>

	  ACPI is an open industry specification co-developed by
	  Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Microsoft, Phoenix, and Toshiba.
	  The specification is available at:
	  <http://www.acpi.info>

config ACPI_SLEEP
	bool
	depends on SUSPEND || HIBERNATION
	default y

config ACPI_PROCFS
	bool "Deprecated /proc/acpi files"
	depends on PROC_FS
	help
	  For backwards compatibility, this option allows
	  deprecated /proc/acpi/ files to exist, even when
	  they have been replaced by functions in /sys.
	  The deprecated files (and their replacements) include:

	  /proc/acpi/sleep (/sys/power/state)
	  /proc/acpi/info (/sys/module/acpi/parameters/acpica_version)
	  /proc/acpi/dsdt (/sys/firmware/acpi/tables/DSDT)
	  /proc/acpi/fadt (/sys/firmware/acpi/tables/FACP)
	  /proc/acpi/debug_layer (/sys/module/acpi/parameters/debug_layer)
	  /proc/acpi/debug_level (/sys/module/acpi/parameters/debug_level)

	  This option has no effect on /proc/acpi/ files
	  and functions which do not yet exist in /sys.

	  Say N to delete /proc/acpi/ files that have moved to /sys/

config ACPI_PROCFS_POWER
	bool "Deprecated power /proc/acpi directories"
	depends on PROC_FS
	default y
	help
	  For backwards compatibility, this option allows
          deprecated power /proc/acpi/ directories to exist, even when
          they have been replaced by functions in /sys.
          The deprecated directories (and their replacements) include:
	  /proc/acpi/battery/* (/sys/class/power_supply/*)
	  /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/* (sys/class/power_supply/*)
	  This option has no effect on /proc/acpi/ directories
	  and functions, which do not yet exist in /sys

	  Say N to delete power /proc/acpi/ directories that have moved to /sys/

config ACPI_SYSFS_POWER
	bool "Future power /sys interface"
	select POWER_SUPPLY
	default y
	help
	  Say N to disable power /sys interface

config ACPI_PROC_EVENT
	bool "Deprecated /proc/acpi/event support"
	depends on PROC_FS
	default y
	help
	  A user-space daemon, acpid, typically reads /proc/acpi/event
	  and handles all ACPI-generated events.

	  These events are now delivered to user-space either
	  via the input layer or as netlink events.

	  This build option enables the old code for legacy
	  user-space implementation.  After some time, this will
	  be moved under CONFIG_ACPI_PROCFS, and then deleted.

	  Say Y here to retain the old behaviour.  Say N if your
	  user-space is newer than kernel 2.6.23 (September 2007).

config ACPI_AC
	tristate "AC Adapter"
	depends on X86
	default y
	help
	  This driver supports the AC Adapter object, which indicates
	  whether a system is on AC or not.  If you have a system that can
	  switch between A/C and battery, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called ac.

config ACPI_BATTERY
	tristate "Battery"
	depends on X86
	default y
	help
	  This driver adds support for battery information through
	  /proc/acpi/battery. If you have a mobile system with a battery, 
	  say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called battery.

config ACPI_BUTTON
	tristate "Button"
	depends on INPUT
	default y
	help
	  This driver handles events on the power, sleep, and lid buttons.
	  A daemon reads /proc/acpi/event and perform user-defined actions
	  such as shutting down the system.  This is necessary for
	  software-controlled poweroff.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called button.

config ACPI_VIDEO
	tristate "Video"
	depends on X86 && BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE && VIDEO_OUTPUT_CONTROL
	depends on INPUT
	select THERMAL
	help
	  This driver implements the ACPI Extensions For Display Adapters
	  for integrated graphics devices on motherboard, as specified in
	  ACPI 2.0 Specification, Appendix B.  This supports basic operations
	  such as defining the video POST device, retrieving EDID information,
	  and setting up a video output.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called video.

config ACPI_FAN
	tristate "Fan"
	select THERMAL
	default y
	help
	  This driver supports ACPI fan devices, allowing user-mode
	  applications to perform basic fan control (on, off, status).

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called fan.

config ACPI_DOCK
	bool "Dock"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This driver supports ACPI-controlled docking stations and removable
	  drive bays such as the IBM Ultrabay and the Dell Module Bay.

config ACPI_PROCESSOR
	tristate "Processor"
	select THERMAL
	default y
	help
	  This driver installs ACPI as the idle handler for Linux and uses
	  ACPI C2 and C3 processor states to save power on systems that
	  support it.  It is required by several flavors of cpufreq
	  performance-state drivers.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called processor.

config ACPI_HOTPLUG_CPU
	bool
	depends on ACPI_PROCESSOR && HOTPLUG_CPU
	select ACPI_CONTAINER
	default y

config ACPI_THERMAL
	tristate "Thermal Zone"
	depends on ACPI_PROCESSOR
	select THERMAL
	default y
	help
	  This driver supports ACPI thermal zones.  Most mobile and
	  some desktop systems support ACPI thermal zones.  It is HIGHLY
	  recommended that this option be enabled, as your processor(s)
	  may be damaged without it.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called thermal.

config ACPI_NUMA
	bool "NUMA support"
	depends on NUMA
	depends on (X86 || IA64)
	default y if IA64_GENERIC || IA64_SGI_SN2

config ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT_FILE
	string "Custom DSDT Table file to include"
	default ""
	depends on !STANDALONE
	help
	  This option supports a custom DSDT by linking it into the kernel.
	  See Documentation/acpi/dsdt-override.txt

	  Enter the full path name to the file which includes the AmlCode
	  declaration.

	  If unsure, don't enter a file name.

config ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT
	bool
	default ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT_FILE != ""

config ACPI_BLACKLIST_YEAR
	int "Disable ACPI for systems before Jan 1st this year" if X86_32
	default 0
	help
	  Enter a 4-digit year, e.g., 2001, to disable ACPI by default
	  on platforms with DMI BIOS date before January 1st that year.
	  "acpi=force" can be used to override this mechanism.

	  Enter 0 to disable this mechanism and allow ACPI to
	  run by default no matter what the year.  (default)

config ACPI_DEBUG
	bool "Debug Statements"
	default n
	help
	  The ACPI subsystem can produce debug output.  Saying Y enables this
	  output and increases the kernel size by around 50K.

	  Use the acpi.debug_layer and acpi.debug_level kernel command-line
	  parameters documented in Documentation/acpi/debug.txt and
	  Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt to control the type and
	  amount of debug output.

config ACPI_DEBUG_FUNC_TRACE
	bool "Additionally enable ACPI function tracing"
	default n
	depends on ACPI_DEBUG
	help
	  ACPI Debug Statements slow down ACPI processing. Function trace
	  is about half of the penalty and is rarely useful.

config ACPI_PCI_SLOT
	tristate "PCI slot detection driver"
	depends on SYSFS
	default n
	help
	  This driver creates entries in /sys/bus/pci/slots/ for all PCI
	  slots in the system.  This can help correlate PCI bus addresses,
	  i.e., segment/bus/device/function tuples, with physical slots in
	  the system.  If you are unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called pci_slot.

config X86_PM_TIMER
	bool "Power Management Timer Support" if EMBEDDED
	depends on X86
	default y
	help
	  The Power Management Timer is available on all ACPI-capable,
	  in most cases even if ACPI is unusable or blacklisted.

	  This timing source is not affected by power management features
	  like aggressive processor idling, throttling, frequency and/or
	  voltage scaling, unlike the commonly used Time Stamp Counter
	  (TSC) timing source.

	  You should nearly always say Y here because many modern
	  systems require this timer. 

config ACPI_CONTAINER
	tristate "Container and Module Devices (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	default (ACPI_HOTPLUG_MEMORY || ACPI_HOTPLUG_CPU || ACPI_HOTPLUG_IO)
	help
	  This driver supports ACPI Container and Module devices (IDs
	  ACPI0004, PNP0A05, and PNP0A06).

	  This helps support hotplug of nodes, CPUs, and memory.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called container.

config ACPI_HOTPLUG_MEMORY
	tristate "Memory Hotplug"
	depends on MEMORY_HOTPLUG
	default n
	help
	  This driver supports ACPI memory hotplug.  The driver
	  fields notifications on ACPI memory devices (PNP0C80),
	  which represent memory ranges that may be onlined or
	  offlined during runtime.

	  If your hardware and firmware do not support adding or
	  removing memory devices at runtime, you need not enable
	  this driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called acpi_memhotplug.

config ACPI_SBS
	tristate "Smart Battery System"
	depends on X86
	help
	  This driver supports the Smart Battery System, another
	  type of access to battery information, found on some laptops.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the modules will be called sbs and sbshc.
