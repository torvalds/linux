 * PARAMETERS:  Info            - Evaluation info block, contains:
 *                  prefix_node     - Prefix or Method/Object Node to execute
 *                  Pathname        - Name of method to execute, If NULL, the
 *                                    Node is the object to execute
 *                  Parameters      - List of parameters to pass to the method,
 *                                    terminated by NULL. Params itself may be
 *                                    NULL if no parameters are being passed.
 *                  return_object   - Where to put method's return value (if
 *                                    any). If NULL, no value is returned.
 *                  parameter_type  - Type of Parameter list
 *                  return_object   - Where to put method's return value (if
 *                                    any). If NULL, no value is returned.
 *                  Flags           - ACPI_IGNORE_RETURN_VALUE to delete return

 *
 * DESCRIPTION: Execute a control method or return the current value of an
 *              ACPI namespace object.
