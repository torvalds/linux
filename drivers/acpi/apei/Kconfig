	  APEI allows to report errors (for example from the chipset)
	  to the operating system. This improves NMI handling
	  especially. In addition it supports error serialization and
	  error injection.

	help
	  Generic Hardware Error Source provides a way to report
	  platform hardware errors (such as that from chipset). It
	  works in so called "Firmware First" mode, that is, hardware
	  errors are reported to firmware firstly, then reported to
	  Linux by firmware. This way, some non-standard hardware
	  error registers or non-standard hardware link can be checked
	  by firmware to produce more valuable hardware error
	  information for Linux.

	  PCIe AER errors may be reported via APEI firmware first mode.
	  Turn on this option to enable the corresponding support.

	  EINJ provides a hardware error injection mechanism, it is
	  mainly used for debugging and testing the other parts of
	  APEI and some other RAS features.

	help
	  Support for CXL protocol Error INJection through debugfs/cxl.
	  Availability and which errors are supported is dependent on
	  the host platform. Look to ACPI v6.5 section 18.6.4 and kernel
	  EINJ documentation for more information.

	  If unsure say 'n'

config ACPI_APEI_ERST_DEBUG

	help
	  ERST is a way provided by APEI to save and retrieve hardware
	  error information to and from a persistent store. Enable this
	  if you want to debugging and testing the ERST kernel support
	  and firmware implementation.
