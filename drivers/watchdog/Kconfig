menuconfig WATCHDOG
	bool "Watchdog Timer Support"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here (and to one of the following options) and create a
	  character special file /dev/watchdog with major number 10 and minor
	  number 130 using mknod ("man mknod"), you will get a watchdog, i.e.:
	  subsequently opening the file and then failing to write to it for
	  longer than 1 minute will result in rebooting the machine. This
	  could be useful for a networked machine that needs to come back
	  on-line as fast as possible after a lock-up. There's both a watchdog
	  implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to
	  reboot the machine) and a driver for hardware watchdog boards, which
	  are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside
	  your computer. For details, read
	  <file:Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.txt> in the kernel source.

	  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon
	  which is available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/watchdog/>. This daemon can
	  also monitor NFS connections and can reboot the machine when the process
	  table is full.

	  If unsure, say N.

if WATCHDOG

config WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT
	bool "Disable watchdog shutdown on close"
	help
	  The default watchdog behaviour (which you get if you say N here) is
	  to stop the timer if the process managing it closes the file
	  /dev/watchdog. It's always remotely possible that this process might
	  get killed. If you say Y here, the watchdog cannot be stopped once
	  it has been started.

	  are running it on an EPX-C3 from Winsystems with the watchdog
	  timer at IO address 0x1ee and 0x1ef.  It will write to both those

# SUPERH (sh + sh64) Architecture

	help
	  This driver adds watchdog support for the integrated watchdog in the
	  SuperH processors. If you have one of these processors and wish
	  to have watchdog support enabled, say Y, otherwise say N.

	  As a side note, saying Y here will automatically boost HZ to 1000
	  so that the timer has a chance to clear the overflow counter. On
	  slower systems (such as the SH-2 and SH-3) this will likely yield
	  some performance issues. As such, the WDT should be avoided here
	  unless it is absolutely necessary.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called shwdt.

config SH_WDT_MMAP

config PCWATCHDOG

	depends on ISA
	---help---
	  This is the driver for the Berkshire Products ISA-PC Watchdog card.
	  This card simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze,
	  and if it does, it reboots your computer after a certain amount of
	  time. This driver is like the WDT501 driver but for different
	  hardware. Please read <file:Documentation/watchdog/pcwd-watchdog.txt>. The PC
	  watchdog cards can be ordered from <http://www.berkprod.com/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	---help---
	  If you have a WDT500P or WDT501P watchdog board, say Y here,
	  otherwise N. It is not possible to probe for this board, which means
	  that you have to inform the kernel about the IO port and IRQ that
	  is needed (you can do this via the io and irq parameters)

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called wdt.

config WDT_501

	depends on WDT
	help
	  Saying Y here and creating a character special file /dev/temperature
	  with major number 10 and minor number 131 ("man mknod") will give
	  you a thermometer inside your computer: reading from
	  /dev/temperature yields one byte, the temperature in degrees
	  Fahrenheit. This works only if you have a WDT501P watchdog board
	  installed.

	  If you want to enable the Fan Tachometer on the WDT501P, then you
	  can do this via the tachometer parameter. Only do this if you have a
