	  This enables support for the Bosch bma085 pressure sensor
	  This support is for integration with the MPU3050 or MPU6050 gyroscope
          device driver.  Only one accelerometer can be registered at a time.
	  Specifying more that one accelerometer in the board file will result
	  in runtime errors.
