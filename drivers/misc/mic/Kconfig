	depends on 64BIT && PCI && X86 && X86_DEV_DMA_OPS
	help
	  This option is selected by any driver which registers a
	  device or driver on the MIC Bus, such as CONFIG_INTEL_MIC_HOST,
	  CONFIG_INTEL_MIC_CARD, CONFIG_INTEL_MIC_X100_DMA etc.

	  If you are building a host/card kernel with an Intel MIC device
	  then say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.

	  More information about the Intel MIC family as well as the Linux
	  OS and tools for MIC to use with this driver are available from

comment "Intel MIC Host Driver"

	tristate "Intel MIC Host Driver"
	depends on 64BIT && PCI && X86 && INTEL_MIC_BUS && SCIF_BUS && MIC_COSM
	select VHOST_RING
	help
	  This enables Host Driver support for the Intel Many Integrated
	  Core (MIC) family of PCIe form factor coprocessor devices that
	  run a 64 bit Linux OS. The driver manages card OS state and
	  enables communication between host and card. Intel MIC X100
	  devices are currently supported.

	  If you are building a host kernel with an Intel MIC device then
	  say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.

comment "Intel MIC Card Driver"

config INTEL_MIC_CARD
	tristate "Intel MIC Card Driver"
	depends on 64BIT && X86 && INTEL_MIC_BUS && SCIF_BUS && MIC_COSM
	select VIRTIO
	help
	  This enables card driver support for the Intel Many Integrated
	  Core (MIC) device family. The card driver communicates shutdown/
	  crash events to the host and allows registration/configuration of
	  virtio devices. Intel MIC X100 devices are currently supported.

	  If you are building a card kernel for an Intel MIC device then
	  say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.

comment "SCIF Driver"

config SCIF
	tristate "SCIF Driver"
	depends on 64BIT && PCI && X86 && SCIF_BUS
	help
	  This enables SCIF Driver support for the Intel Many Integrated
	  Core (MIC) family of PCIe form factor coprocessor devices that
	  run a 64 bit Linux OS. The Symmetric Communication Interface
	  (SCIF (pronounced as skiff)) is a low level communications API
	  across PCIe currently implemented for MIC.

	  If you are building a host kernel with an Intel MIC device then
	  say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.

	depends on 64BIT && PCI && X86 && SCIF
	help
	  This enables COSM driver support for the Intel Many
	  Integrated Core (MIC) family of PCIe form factor coprocessor
	  devices. COSM drivers implement functions such as boot,
	  shutdown, reset and reboot of MIC devices.

	  If you are building a host kernel with an Intel MIC device then
	  say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.
