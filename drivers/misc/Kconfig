config IBM_ASM
	tristate "Device driver for IBM RSA service processor"
	depends on X86 && PCI && INPUT && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This option enables device driver support for in-band access to the
	  IBM RSA (Condor) service processor in eServer xSeries systems.
	  The ibmasm device driver allows user space application to access
	  ASM (Advanced Systems Management) functions on the service
	  processor. The driver is meant to be used in conjunction with
	  a user space API.
	  The ibmasm driver also enables the OS to use the UART on the
	  service processor board as a regular serial port. To make use of
	  this feature serial driver support (CONFIG_SERIAL_8250) must be
	  enabled.

	  WARNING: This software may not be supported or function
	  correctly on your IBM server. Please consult the IBM ServerProven
	  website <http://www.pc.ibm.com/ww/eserver/xseries/serverproven> for
	  information on the specific driver level and support statement
	  for your IBM server.

config PHANTOM
	tristate "Sensable PHANToM"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build a driver for Sensable PHANToM device.

	  If you choose to build module, its name will be phantom. If unsure,
	  say N here.

config EEPROM_93CX6
	tristate "EEPROM 93CX6 support"
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the EEPROM chipsets 93c46 and 93c66.
	  The driver supports both read as well as write commands.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SGI_IOC4
	tristate "SGI IOC4 Base IO support"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  This option enables basic support for the IOC4 chip on certain
	  SGI IO controller cards (IO9, IO10, and PCI-RT).  This option
	  does not enable any specific functions on such a card, but provides
	  necessary infrastructure for other drivers to utilize.

	  If you have an SGI Altix with an IOC4-based card say Y.
	  Otherwise say N.

config TIFM_CORE
	tristate "TI Flash Media interface support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PCI
	help
	  If you want support for Texas Instruments(R) Flash Media adapters
	  you should select this option and then also choose an appropriate
	  host adapter, such as 'TI Flash Media PCI74xx/PCI76xx host adapter
	  support', if you have a TI PCI74xx compatible card reader, for
	  example.
	  You will also have to select some flash card format drivers. MMC/SD
	  cards are supported via 'MMC/SD Card support: TI Flash Media MMC/SD
	  Interface support (MMC_TIFM_SD)'.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called tifm_core.

config TIFM_7XX1
	tristate "TI Flash Media PCI74xx/PCI76xx host adapter support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PCI && TIFM_CORE && EXPERIMENTAL
	default TIFM_CORE
	help
	  This option enables support for Texas Instruments(R) PCI74xx and
	  PCI76xx families of Flash Media adapters, found in many laptops.
	  To make actual use of the device, you will have to select some
	  flash card format drivers, as outlined in the TIFM_CORE Help.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called tifm_7xx1.

config ACER_WMI

	depends on X86
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	depends on ACPI
	depends on ACPI_WMI
	depends on LEDS_CLASS
	depends on BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
	---help---
	  This is a driver for newer Acer (and Wistron) laptops. It adds
	  wireless radio and bluetooth control, and on some laptops,
	  exposes the mail LED and LCD backlight.

        ---help---
	  This is the new Linux driver for Asus laptops. It may also support some
	  MEDION, JVC or VICTOR laptops. It makes all the extra buttons generate
	  standard ACPI events that go through /proc/acpi/events. It also adds
	  support for video output switching, LCD backlight control, Bluetooth and
	  Wlan control, and most importantly, allows you to blink those fancy LEDs.

	  For more information and a userspace daemon for handling the extra
	  buttons see <http://acpi4asus.sf.net/>.

	  If you have an ACPI-compatible ASUS laptop, say Y or M here.

	depends on X86 && ACPI
	select BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
	select HWMON
	select NVRAM
	depends on INPUT
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad laptops. It adds
	  support for Fn-Fx key combinations, Bluetooth control, video
	  output switching, ThinkLight control, UltraBay eject and more.
	  For more information about this driver see 
	  <file:Documentation/thinkpad-acpi.txt> and <http://ibm-acpi.sf.net/> .

	  This driver was formerly known as ibm-acpi.

	  If you have an IBM or Lenovo ThinkPad laptop, say Y or M here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_DEBUG
	bool "Verbose debug mode"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables extra debugging information, at the expense of a slightly
	  increase in driver size.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_DOCK
	bool "Legacy Docking Station Support"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	depends on ACPI_DOCK=n
	default n
	---help---
	  Allows the thinkpad_acpi driver to handle docking station events.
	  This support was made obsolete by the generic ACPI docking station
	  support (CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK).  It will allow locking and removing the
	  laptop from the docking station, but will not properly connect PCI
	  devices.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_BAY
	bool "Legacy Removable Bay Support"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default y
	---help---
	  Allows the thinkpad_acpi driver to handle removable bays.  It will
	  electrically disable the device in the bay, and also generate
	  notifications when the bay lever is ejected or inserted.

	  If you are not sure, say Y here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_HOTKEY_POLL
	bool "Suport NVRAM polling for hot keys"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default y
	---help---
	  Some thinkpad models benefit from NVRAM polling to detect a few of
	  the hot key press events.  If you know your ThinkPad model does not
	  need to do NVRAM polling to support any of the hot keys you use,
	  unselecting this option will save about 1kB of memory.

	  ThinkPads T40 and newer, R52 and newer, and X31 and newer are
	  unlikely to need NVRAM polling in their latest BIOS versions.

	  NVRAM polling can detect at most the following keys: ThinkPad/Access
	  IBM, Zoom, Switch Display (fn+F7), ThinkLight, Volume up/down/mute,
	  Brightness up/down, Display Expand (fn+F8), Hibernate (fn+F12).

	  If you are not sure, say Y here.  The driver enables polling only if
	  it is strictly necessary to do so.

config ATMEL_SSC
	tristate "Device driver for Atmel SSC peripheral"
	depends on AVR32 || ARCH_AT91
	---help---
	  This option enables device driver support for Atmel Syncronized
	  Serial Communication peripheral (SSC).

	  The SSC peripheral supports a wide variety of serial frame based
	  communications, i.e. I2S, SPI, etc.

	  If unsure, say N.

config INTEL_MENLOW
	tristate "Thermal Management driver for Intel menlow platform"
	depends on ACPI_THERMAL
	---help---
	  ACPI thermal management enhancement driver on
	  Intel Menlow platform.

	  If unsure, say N.

config ENCLOSURE_SERVICES
	tristate "Enclosure Services"
	default n
	help
	  Provides support for intelligent enclosures (bays which
	  contain storage devices).  You also need either a host
	  driver (SCSI/ATA) which supports enclosures
	  or a SCSI enclosure device (SES) to use these services.
