	default 40
	---help---
	  This is the number of characters per line on the LCD in custom profile.
	  Common values are 16,20,24,40.

config PANEL_LCD_BWIDTH
	depends on PANEL && PANEL_PROFILE="0" && PANEL_LCD="1"
	int "Internal LCD line width (1-40, 40 by default)"
	range 1 40
	default 40
	---help---
	  Most LCDs use a standard controller which supports hardware lines of 40
	  characters, although sometimes only 16, 20 or 24 of them are really wired
	  to the terminal. This results in some non-visible but addressable characters,
	  and is the case for most parallel LCDs. Other LCDs, and some serial ones,
	  however, use the same line width internally as what is visible. The KS0074
	  for example, uses 16 characters per line for 16 visible characters per line.

	  This option lets you configure the value used by your LCD in 'custom' profile.
	  If you don't know, put '40' here.

config PANEL_LCD_HWIDTH
	depends on PANEL && PANEL_PROFILE="0" && PANEL_LCD="1"
	int "Hardware LCD line width (1-64, 64 by default)"
	range 1 64
	default 64
	---help---
	  Most LCDs use a single address bit to differentiate line 0 and line 1. Since
	  some of them need to be able to address 40 chars with the lower bits, they
	  often use the immediately superior power of 2, which is 64, to address the
	  next line.

	  If you don't know what your LCD uses, in doubt let 16 here for a 2x16, and
	  64 here for a 2x40.

config PANEL_LCD_CHARSET
	depends on PANEL && PANEL_PROFILE="0" && PANEL_LCD="1"
	int "LCD character set (0=normal, 1=KS0074)"
	range 0 1
	default 0
	---help---
	  Some controllers such as the KS0074 use a somewhat strange character set
	  where many symbols are at unusual places. The driver knows how to map
	  'standard' ASCII characters to the character sets used by these controllers.
	  Valid values are :

	     0 : normal (untranslated) character set
	     1 : KS0074 character set

	  If you don't know, use the normal one (0).

config PANEL_LCD_PROTO
	depends on PANEL && PANEL_PROFILE="0" && PANEL_LCD="1"
	int "LCD communication mode (0=parallel 8 bits, 1=serial)"
	range 0 1
	default 0
	---help---
	  This driver now supports any serial or parallel LCD wired to a parallel
	  port. But before assigning signals, the driver needs to know if it will
	  be driving a serial LCD or a parallel one. Serial LCDs only use 2 wires
	  (SDA/SCL), while parallel ones use 2 or 3 wires for the control signals
	  (E, RS, sometimes RW), and 4 or 8 for the data. Use 0 here for a 8 bits
	  parallel LCD, and 1 for a serial LCD.

config PANEL_LCD_PIN_E

        int "Parallel port pin number & polarity connected to the LCD E signal (-17...17) "
	range -17 17
	default 14
	---help---
	  This describes the number of the parallel port pin to which the LCD 'E'
	  signal has been connected. It can be :

	          0 : no connection (eg: connected to ground)
	      1..17 : directly connected to any of these pins on the DB25 plug
	    -1..-17 : connected to the same pin through an inverter (eg: transistor).

	  Default for the 'E' pin in custom profile is '14' (AUTOFEED).

	  This describes the number of the parallel port pin to which the LCD 'RW'
	  signal has been connected. It can be :

	          0 : no connection (eg: connected to ground)
	      1..17 : directly connected to any of these pins on the DB25 plug

	  This describes the number of the parallel port pin to which the serial
	  LCD 'SCL' signal has been connected. It can be :

config PANEL_CHANGE_MESSAGE
	depends on PANEL
	bool "Change LCD initialization message ?"
	default "n"
	---help---
	  This allows you to replace the boot message indicating the kernel version
	  and the driver version with a custom message. This is useful on appliances
	  where a simple 'Starting system' message can be enough to stop a customer
	  from worrying.

	  If you say 'Y' here, you'll be able to choose a message yourself. Otherwise,
	  say 'N' and keep the default message with the version.

config PANEL_BOOT_MESSAGE
	depends on PANEL && PANEL_CHANGE_MESSAGE="y"
	string "New initialization message"
	default ""
	---help---
	  This allows you to replace the boot message indicating the kernel version
	  and the driver version with a custom message. This is useful on appliances
	  where a simple 'Starting system' message can be enough to stop a customer
	  from worrying.

	  An empty message will only clear the display at driver init time. Any other
	  printf()-formatted message is valid with newline and escape codes.
