config ATMEL_PWM
	tristate "Atmel AT32/AT91 PWM support"
	depends on AVR32 || ARCH_AT91
	help
	  This option enables device driver support for the PWM channels
	  on certain Atmel prcoessors.  Pulse Width Modulation is used for
	  purposes including software controlled power-efficent backlights
	  on LCD displays, motor control, and waveform generation.

config ATMEL_TCLIB

	depends on (AVR32 || ARCH_AT91)
	help
	  Select this if you want a library to allocate the Timer/Counter
	  blocks found on many Atmel processors.  This facilitates using
	  these blocks by different drivers despite processor differences.

config ATMEL_TCB_CLKSRC

	depends on ATMEL_TCLIB && GENERIC_TIME
	default y
	help
	  Select this to get a high precision clocksource based on a
	  TC block with a 5+ MHz base clock rate.  Two timer channels
	  are combined to make a single 32-bit timer.

	  When GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS is defined, the third timer channel
	  may be used as a clock event device supporting oneshot mode
	  (delays of up to two seconds) based on the 32 KiHz clock.

	help
	  Some chips provide more than one TC block, so you have the
	  choice of which one to use for the clock framework.  The other
	  TC can be used for other purposes, such as PWM generation and
	  interval timing.

config IBM_ASM
	tristate "Device driver for IBM RSA service processor"
	depends on X86 && PCI && INPUT && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This option enables device driver support for in-band access to the
	  IBM RSA (Condor) service processor in eServer xSeries systems.
	  The ibmasm device driver allows user space application to access
	  ASM (Advanced Systems Management) functions on the service
	  processor. The driver is meant to be used in conjunction with
	  a user space API.
	  The ibmasm driver also enables the OS to use the UART on the
	  service processor board as a regular serial port. To make use of
	  this feature serial driver support (CONFIG_SERIAL_8250) must be
	  enabled.

	  WARNING: This software may not be supported or function
	  correctly on your IBM server. Please consult the IBM ServerProven
	  website <http://www.pc.ibm.com/ww/eserver/xseries/serverproven> for
	  information on the specific driver level and support statement
	  for your IBM server.

	  This is a driver for the EEPROM chipsets 93c46 and 93c66.
	  The driver supports both read as well as write commands.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SGI_IOC4
	tristate "SGI IOC4 Base IO support"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  This option enables basic support for the IOC4 chip on certain
	  SGI IO controller cards (IO9, IO10, and PCI-RT).  This option
	  does not enable any specific functions on such a card, but provides
	  necessary infrastructure for other drivers to utilize.

	  If you have an SGI Altix with an IOC4-based card say Y.
	  Otherwise say N.

config TIFM_CORE

	  If you want support for Texas Instruments(R) Flash Media adapters
	  you should select this option and then also choose an appropriate
	  host adapter, such as 'TI Flash Media PCI74xx/PCI76xx host adapter
	  support', if you have a TI PCI74xx compatible card reader, for
	  example.
	  You will also have to select some flash card format drivers. MMC/SD
	  cards are supported via 'MMC/SD Card support: TI Flash Media MMC/SD

	---help---
	  This is a driver for the IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad laptops. It adds
	  support for Fn-Fx key combinations, Bluetooth control, video
	  output switching, ThinkLight control, UltraBay eject and more.
	  For more information about this driver see
	  <file:Documentation/laptops/thinkpad-acpi.txt> and
	  <http://ibm-acpi.sf.net/> .

	  This driver was formerly known as ibm-acpi.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_DEBUG
	bool "Verbose debug mode"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables extra debugging information, at the expense of a slightly
	  increase in driver size.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_DOCK
	bool "Legacy Docking Station Support"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	depends on ACPI_DOCK=n
	default n
	---help---
	  Allows the thinkpad_acpi driver to handle docking station events.
	  This support was made obsolete by the generic ACPI docking station
	  support (CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK).  It will allow locking and removing the
	  laptop from the docking station, but will not properly connect PCI
	  devices.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_BAY
	bool "Legacy Removable Bay Support"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default y
	---help---
	  Allows the thinkpad_acpi driver to handle removable bays.  It will
	  electrically disable the device in the bay, and also generate

	  If you are not sure, say Y here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_VIDEO
	bool "Video output control support"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default y
	---help---
	  Allows the thinkpad_acpi driver to provide an interface to control
	  the various video output ports.

	  This feature often won't work well, depending on ThinkPad model,
	  display state, video output devices in use, whether there is a X
	  server running, phase of the moon, and the current mood of
	  Schroedinger's cat.  If you can use X.org's RandR to control
	  your ThinkPad's video output ports instead of this feature,
	  don't think twice: do it and say N here to save some memory.

	  If you are not sure, say Y here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_HOTKEY_POLL
	bool "Support NVRAM polling for hot keys"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default y
	---help---
	  Some thinkpad models benefit from NVRAM polling to detect a few of
	  the hot key press events.  If you know your ThinkPad model does not
	  need to do NVRAM polling to support any of the hot keys you use,
	  unselecting this option will save about 1kB of memory.

	  ThinkPads T40 and newer, R52 and newer, and X31 and newer are
	  unlikely to need NVRAM polling in their latest BIOS versions.

	  NVRAM polling can detect at most the following keys: ThinkPad/Access
	  IBM, Zoom, Switch Display (fn+F7), ThinkLight, Volume up/down/mute,
	  Brightness up/down, Display Expand (fn+F8), Hibernate (fn+F12).

	  If you are not sure, say Y here.  The driver enables polling only if
	  it is strictly necessary to do so.

config ATMEL_SSC
	tristate "Device driver for Atmel SSC peripheral"
	depends on AVR32 || ARCH_AT91
	---help---
	  This option enables device driver support for Atmel Syncronized
	  Serial Communication peripheral (SSC).

	  The SSC peripheral supports a wide variety of serial frame based

	  If you have an Eee PC laptop, say Y or M here.

config ENCLOSURE_SERVICES
	tristate "Enclosure Services"
	default n
	help
	  Provides support for intelligent enclosures (bays which
	  contain storage devices).  You also need either a host

	  An SGI machine can be divided into multiple Single System
	  Images which act independently of each other and have
	  hardware based memory protection from the others.  Enabling
	  this feature will allow for direct communication between SSIs
	  based on a network adapter and DMA messaging.

config HP_ILO
	tristate "Channel interface driver for HP iLO/iLO2 processor"
	depends on PCI
	default n
	help
	  The channel interface driver allows applications to communicate
	  with iLO/iLO2 management processors present on HP ProLiant
	  servers.  Upon loading, the driver creates /dev/hpilo/dXccbN files,
	  which can be used to gather data from the management processor,
	  via read and write system calls.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called hpilo.

config SGI_GRU

	default n
	select MMU_NOTIFIER
	---help---
	The GRU is a hardware resource located in the system chipset. The GRU
	contains memory that can be mmapped into the user address space. This memory is
	used to communicate with the GRU to perform functions such as load/store,
	scatter/gather, bcopy, AMOs, etc.  The GRU is directly accessed by user
	instructions using user virtual addresses. GRU instructions (ex., bcopy) use
	user virtual addresses for operands.

	If you are not running on a SGI UV system, say N.

config SGI_GRU_DEBUG
