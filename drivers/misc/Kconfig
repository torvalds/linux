menuconfig MISC_DEVICES
	bool "Misc devices"
	default y
	---help---
	  Say Y here to get to see options for device drivers from various
	  different categories. This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled.

if MISC_DEVICES

config ATMEL_PWM
	tristate "Atmel AT32/AT91 PWM support"
	depends on AVR32 || ARCH_AT91SAM9263 || ARCH_AT91SAM9RL || ARCH_AT91CAP9
	help
	  This option enables device driver support for the PWM channels
	  on certain Atmel prcoessors.  Pulse Width Modulation is used for
	  purposes including software controlled power-efficent backlights
	  on LCD displays, motor control, and waveform generation.

config ATMEL_TCLIB
	bool "Atmel AT32/AT91 Timer/Counter Library"
	depends on (AVR32 || ARCH_AT91)
	help
	  Select this if you want a library to allocate the Timer/Counter
	  blocks found on many Atmel processors.  This facilitates using
	  these blocks by different drivers despite processor differences.

config ATMEL_TCB_CLKSRC
	bool "TC Block Clocksource"
	depends on ATMEL_TCLIB && GENERIC_TIME
	default y
	help
	  Select this to get a high precision clocksource based on a
	  TC block with a 5+ MHz base clock rate.  Two timer channels
	  are combined to make a single 32-bit timer.

	  When GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS is defined, the third timer channel
	  may be used as a clock event device supporting oneshot mode
	  (delays of up to two seconds) based on the 32 KiHz clock.

config ATMEL_TCB_CLKSRC_BLOCK
	int
	depends on ATMEL_TCB_CLKSRC
	prompt "TC Block" if ARCH_AT91RM9200 || ARCH_AT91SAM9260 || CPU_AT32AP700X
	default 0
	range 0 1
	help
	  Some chips provide more than one TC block, so you have the
	  choice of which one to use for the clock framework.  The other
	  TC can be used for other purposes, such as PWM generation and
	  interval timing.

config IBM_ASM
	tristate "Device driver for IBM RSA service processor"
	depends on X86 && PCI && INPUT && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This option enables device driver support for in-band access to the
	  IBM RSA (Condor) service processor in eServer xSeries systems.
	  The ibmasm device driver allows user space application to access
	  ASM (Advanced Systems Management) functions on the service
	  processor. The driver is meant to be used in conjunction with
	  a user space API.
	  The ibmasm driver also enables the OS to use the UART on the
	  service processor board as a regular serial port. To make use of
	  this feature serial driver support (CONFIG_SERIAL_8250) must be
	  enabled.

	  WARNING: This software may not be supported or function
	  correctly on your IBM server. Please consult the IBM ServerProven
	  website <http://www.pc.ibm.com/ww/eserver/xseries/serverproven> for
	  information on the specific driver level and support statement
	  for your IBM server.

config PHANTOM
	tristate "Sensable PHANToM (PCI)"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build a driver for Sensable PHANToM device.

	  This driver is only for PCI PHANToMs.

	  If you choose to build module, its name will be phantom. If unsure,
	  say N here.

config EEPROM_93CX6
	tristate "EEPROM 93CX6 support"
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the EEPROM chipsets 93c46 and 93c66.
	  The driver supports both read as well as write commands.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SGI_IOC4
	tristate "SGI IOC4 Base IO support"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  This option enables basic support for the IOC4 chip on certain
	  SGI IO controller cards (IO9, IO10, and PCI-RT).  This option
	  does not enable any specific functions on such a card, but provides
	  necessary infrastructure for other drivers to utilize.

	  If you have an SGI Altix with an IOC4-based card say Y.
	  Otherwise say N.

config TIFM_CORE
	tristate "TI Flash Media interface support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PCI
	help
	  If you want support for Texas Instruments(R) Flash Media adapters
	  you should select this option and then also choose an appropriate
	  host adapter, such as 'TI Flash Media PCI74xx/PCI76xx host adapter
	  support', if you have a TI PCI74xx compatible card reader, for
	  example.
	  You will also have to select some flash card format drivers. MMC/SD
	  cards are supported via 'MMC/SD Card support: TI Flash Media MMC/SD
	  Interface support (MMC_TIFM_SD)'.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called tifm_core.

config TIFM_7XX1
	tristate "TI Flash Media PCI74xx/PCI76xx host adapter support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PCI && TIFM_CORE && EXPERIMENTAL
	default TIFM_CORE
	help
	  This option enables support for Texas Instruments(R) PCI74xx and
	  PCI76xx families of Flash Media adapters, found in many laptops.
	  To make actual use of the device, you will have to select some
	  flash card format drivers, as outlined in the TIFM_CORE Help.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called tifm_7xx1.

config ICS932S401
	tristate "Integrated Circuits ICS932S401"
	depends on I2C && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the Integrated Circuits
	  ICS932S401 clock control chips.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called ics932s401.

config ATMEL_SSC
	tristate "Device driver for Atmel SSC peripheral"
	depends on AVR32 || ARCH_AT91
	---help---
	  This option enables device driver support for Atmel Syncronized
	  Serial Communication peripheral (SSC).

	  The SSC peripheral supports a wide variety of serial frame based
	  communications, i.e. I2S, SPI, etc.

	  If unsure, say N.

config ENCLOSURE_SERVICES
	tristate "Enclosure Services"
	default n
	help
	  Provides support for intelligent enclosures (bays which
	  contain storage devices).  You also need either a host
	  driver (SCSI/ATA) which supports enclosures
	  or a SCSI enclosure device (SES) to use these services.

config SGI_XP
	tristate "Support communication between SGI SSIs"
	depends on NET
	depends on (IA64_GENERIC || IA64_SGI_SN2 || IA64_SGI_UV || X86_64) && SMP

	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR if IA64_GENERIC || IA64_SGI_SN2
	select SGI_GRU if (IA64_GENERIC || IA64_SGI_UV || X86_64) && SMP
	---help---
	  An SGI machine can be divided into multiple Single System
	  Images which act independently of each other and have
	  hardware based memory protection from the others.  Enabling
	  this feature will allow for direct communication between SSIs
	  based on a network adapter and DMA messaging.

config HP_ILO
	tristate "Channel interface driver for HP iLO/iLO2 processor"
	depends on PCI
	default n
	help
	  The channel interface driver allows applications to communicate
	  with iLO/iLO2 management processors present on HP ProLiant
	  servers.  Upon loading, the driver creates /dev/hpilo/dXccbN files,
	  which can be used to gather data from the management processor,
	  via read and write system calls.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called hpilo.

config SGI_GRU
	tristate "SGI GRU driver"
	depends on (X86_64 || IA64_SGI_UV || IA64_GENERIC) && SMP
	default n
	select MMU_NOTIFIER
	---help---
	The GRU is a hardware resource located in the system chipset. The GRU
	contains memory that can be mmapped into the user address space. This memory is
	used to communicate with the GRU to perform functions such as load/store,
	scatter/gather, bcopy, AMOs, etc.  The GRU is directly accessed by user
	instructions using user virtual addresses. GRU instructions (ex., bcopy) use
	user virtual addresses for operands.

	If you are not running on a SGI UV system, say N.

config SGI_GRU_DEBUG
	bool  "SGI GRU driver debug"
	depends on SGI_GRU
	default n
	---help---
	This option enables addition debugging code for the SGI GRU driver. If
