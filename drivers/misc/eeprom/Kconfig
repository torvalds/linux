config EEPROM_AT24
	tristate "I2C EEPROMs from most vendors"
	depends on I2C && SYSFS && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Enable this driver to get read/write support to most I2C EEPROMs,
	  after you configure the driver to know about each EEPROM on
	  your target board.  Use these generic chip names, instead of
	  vendor-specific ones like at24c64 or 24lc02:

	     24c00, 24c01, 24c02, spd (readonly 24c02), 24c04, 24c08,
	     24c16, 24c32, 24c64, 24c128, 24c256, 24c512, 24c1024

	  Unless you like data loss puzzles, always be sure that any chip
	  you configure as a 24c32 (32 kbit) or larger is NOT really a
	  24c16 (16 kbit) or smaller, and vice versa. Marking the chip
	  as read-only won't help recover from this. Also, if your chip
	  has any software write-protect mechanism you may want to review the
	  code to make sure this driver won't turn it on by accident.

	  If you use this with an SMBus adapter instead of an I2C adapter,
	  full functionality is not available.  Only smaller devices are
	  supported (24c16 and below, max 4 kByte).

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called at24.

config EEPROM_AT25
	tristate "SPI EEPROMs from most vendors"
	depends on SPI && SYSFS
	help
	  Enable this driver to get read/write support to most SPI EEPROMs,
	  after you configure the board init code to know about each eeprom
	  on your target board.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called at25.

config EEPROM_LEGACY
	tristate "Old I2C EEPROM reader"
	depends on I2C && SYSFS
	help
	  If you say yes here you get read-only access to the EEPROM data
	  available on modern memory DIMMs and Sony Vaio laptops via I2C. Such
	  EEPROMs could theoretically be available on other devices as well.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called eeprom.

config EEPROM_93CX6
	tristate "EEPROM 93CX6 support"
	help
	  This is a driver for the EEPROM chipsets 93c46 and 93c66.
	  The driver supports both read as well as write commands.

	  If unsure, say N.
