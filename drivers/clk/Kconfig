	  This driver supports the TI CDCE913/925/937/949 programmable clock
	  synthesizer. Each chip has different number of PLLs and outputs.
	  For example, the CDCE925 contains two PLLs with spread-spectrum
	  clocking support and five output dividers. The driver only supports
	  the following setup, and uses a fixed setting for the output muxes.
	  Y1 is derived from the input clock
	  Y2 and Y3 derive from PLL1
	  Y4 and Y5 derive from PLL2
	  Given a target output frequency, the driver will set the PLL and
	  divider to best approximate the desired output.
