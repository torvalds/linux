	help
	  This driver supports clock controller of Sophgo CV18XX series SoC.
	  The driver require a 25MHz Oscillator to function generate clock.
	  It includes PLLs, common clock function and some vendor clock for
	  IPs of CV18XX series SoC

	help
	  This driver supports the PLL clock controller on the
	  Sophgo SG2042 SoC. This clock IP uses three oscillators with
	  frequency of 25 MHz as input, which are used for Main/Fixed
	  PLL, DDR PLL 0 and DDR PLL 1 respectively.

	help
	  This driver supports the Clock Generator on the
	  Sophgo SG2042 SoC. This clock IP depends on SG2042 PLL clock
	  because it uses PLL clocks as input.
	  This driver provides clock function such as DIV/Mux/Gate.
