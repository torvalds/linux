	  Legacy clock drivers being used on older (A10, A13, A20,
	  A23, A31, A80) SoCs. These drivers are kept around for
	  Device Tree backward compatibility issues, in case one would
	  still use a Device Tree with one clock provider by
	  node. Newer Device Trees and newer SoCs use the drivers
	  controlled by CONFIG_SUNXI_CCU.

	  Legacy clock driver for the A31 PRCM clocks. Those are
