menuconfig DMABUF_HEAPS_DEFERRED_FREE
	bool "DMA-BUF heaps deferred-free library"
	help
	  Choose this option to enable the DMA-BUF heaps deferred-free library.

menuconfig DMABUF_HEAPS_PAGE_POOL
	bool "DMA-BUF heaps page-pool library"
	help
	  Choose this option to enable the DMA-BUF heaps page-pool library.

config DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM
	tristate "DMA-BUF System Heap"
	depends on DMABUF_HEAPS
	select DMABUF_HEAPS_PAGE_POOL
	help
	  Choose this option to enable the system dmabuf heap. The system heap
	  is backed by pages from the buddy allocator. If in doubt, say Y.

config DMABUF_HEAPS_CMA
	tristate "DMA-BUF CMA Heap"
	depends on DMABUF_HEAPS && DMA_CMA
	help
	  Choose this option to enable dma-buf CMA heap. This heap is backed
	  by the Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA). If your system has these
	  regions, you should say Y here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS
	tristate "QCOM DMA-BUF Heaps"
	depends on DMABUF_HEAPS
	help
	  Choose this option to build the dma-buf heap module. Other
	  heaps can subsequently be compiled into this module by enabling
	  the appropriate defconfig option.
	  If in doubt, say M here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM
	bool "QCOM DMA-BUF System Heap"
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS
	help
	  Choose this option to build the QCOM DMA-BUF system
	  heap. This heap combines the built-in system heap
	  along with other optimizatons. If in doubt, say Y
	  here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_PAGE_POOL_REFILL
	bool "QCOM DMA-BUF Page Pool Refill"
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM
	help
	  Choose this option to enable the page pool auto refill
	  feature for the system heap's page pools. When enabled,
	  a thread is created which wakes up to refill the page pools
	  when they fall below a particular threshold, which in turn
	  results in smaller allocation latencies. If in doubt, say Y
	  here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM_SECURE
	bool "QCOM DMA-BUF System Secure Heap"
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS && QCOM_SECURE_BUFFER
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM
	help
	  Choose this option to build the QCOM DMA-BUF system
	  secure heap. This heap, which combines the built-in
	  system heap along with other optimizations, assigns
	  memory that is secure by default. If in doubt, say Y
	  here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM_UNCACHED
	bool "QCOM DMA-BUF Uncached System Heap"
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS && QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM
	help
	  Choose this option to create an uncached QCOM DMA-BUF
	  system heap. This heap is equivalent to our system heap,
	  such that the memory is mapped as uncached. If in doubt,
	  say Y here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_CMA
	bool "QCOM DMA-BUF CMA Heap"
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS && DMA_CMA
	help
	  Choose this option to build the QCOM DMA-BUF CMA heap.
	  If in doubt, say Y here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_CARVEOUT
	bool "QCOM dma-buf Carveout Heap"
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS
	help
	  Choose this option to build the QCOM DMA-BUF Carveout heap.
	  If in doubt, say Y here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_UBWCP
	bool "QCOM dma-buf UBWC-P Heap"
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM
	help
	  Choose this option to build the QCOM DMA-BUF UBWC-P heap.
	  The heap itself is backed by system heap memory and works
	  in tandem with the UBWC-P driver.
	  If in doubt, say Y here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_UBWCP_MOVABLE
	bool "QCOM dma-buf UBWC-P Movable Heap"
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_UBWCP
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM_MOVABLE
	help
	   Choose this option to build the QCOM DMA-BUF UBWC-P
	   movable heap. The heap is backed by qcom,system-movable
	   which itself is backed by the system heap memory and works
	   in tandem with the UBWC-P driver.
	   If in doubt, say N here.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_TUI_CARVEOUT
	bool "QCOM DMA-BUF TUI Carveout Heap"
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS
	help
	  Choose this option to build the QCOM Trusted UI carvout heap.
	  This heap is controlled from an ioctl, and memory is transferred
	  to it from the Primary VM. Not GKI-Compatible as it cannot
	  be built as a module.

config QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM_MOVABLE
	bool "QCOM dma-buf system-movable heap"
	depends on QCOM_DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM
	help
	  Choose this option to build QCOM DMA-BUF SYSTEM-MOVABLE heap.
	  This heap itself is backed by the system heap memory and
	  works in tandem with the system-movable driver to be able to
	  lend memory from the movable zone.
	  If in doubt, say N here.
