	  Support for NVMEM(Non Volatile Memory) devices like EEPROM, EFUSES...

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface to NVMEM
	  from both the Linux Kernel and the userspace.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem_core.

	  If unsure, say no.

	depends on SOC_IMX6
	help
	  This is a driver for the On-Chip OTP Controller (OCOTP) available on
	  i.MX6 SoCs, providing access to 4 Kbits of one-time programmable
	  eFuses.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem-imx-ocotp.

	tristate "Freescale MXS On-Chip OTP Memory Support"
	depends on ARCH_MXS || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will get readonly access to the
	  One Time Programmable memory pages that are stored
	  on the Freescale i.MX23/i.MX28 processor.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem-mxs-ocotp.

	tristate "QCOM QFPROM Support"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST
	select REGMAP_MMIO
	help
	  Say y here to enable QFPROM support. The QFPROM provides access
	  functions for QFPROM data to rest of the drivers via nvmem interface.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem_qfprom.

config NVMEM_SUNXI_SID
	tristate "Allwinner SoCs SID support"
	depends on ARCH_SUNXI
	select REGMAP_MMIO
	help
	  This is a driver for the 'security ID' available on various Allwinner
	  devices.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem_sunxi_sid.

config NVMEM_VF610_OCOTP
	tristate "VF610 SoC OCOTP support"
	depends on SOC_VF610 || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  This is a driver for the 'OCOTP' peripheral available on Vybrid
	  devices like VF5xx and VF6xx.

	  This driver can also be build as a module. If so, the module will
	  be called nvmem-vf610-ocotp.
