	  Support for NVMEM(Non Volatile Memory) devices like EEPROM, EFUSES...

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface to NVMEM
	  from both the Linux Kernel and the userspace.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem_core.

	  If unsure, say no.

config NVMEM_IMX_OCOTP
	tristate "i.MX6 On-Chip OTP Controller support"
	depends on SOC_IMX6 || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  This is a driver for the On-Chip OTP Controller (OCOTP) available on
	  i.MX6 SoCs, providing access to 4 Kbits of one-time programmable
	  eFuses.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem-imx-ocotp.

	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for NXP LPC18xx EEPROM memory found in
	  NXP LPC185x/3x and LPC435x/3x/2x/1x devices.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called nvmem_lpc18xx_eeprom.

config NVMEM_MXS_OCOTP
	tristate "Freescale MXS On-Chip OTP Memory Support"
	depends on ARCH_MXS || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will get readonly access to the
	  One Time Programmable memory pages that are stored
	  on the Freescale i.MX23/i.MX28 processor.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem-mxs-ocotp.

config MTK_EFUSE
	tristate "Mediatek SoCs EFUSE support"
	depends on ARCH_MEDIATEK || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  This is a driver to access hardware related data like sensor
	  calibration, HDMI impedance etc.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called efuse-mtk.

config QCOM_QFPROM
	tristate "QCOM QFPROM Support"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  Say y here to enable QFPROM support. The QFPROM provides access
	  functions for QFPROM data to rest of the drivers via nvmem interface.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem_qfprom.

config ROCKCHIP_EFUSE
	tristate "Rockchip eFuse Support"
	depends on ARCH_ROCKCHIP || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  This is a simple drive to dump specified values of Rockchip SoC
	  from eFuse, such as cpu-leakage.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem_rockchip_efuse.

config NVMEM_SUNXI_SID
	tristate "Allwinner SoCs SID support"
	depends on ARCH_SUNXI
	help
	  This is a driver for the 'security ID' available on various Allwinner
	  devices.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem_sunxi_sid.

config NVMEM_VF610_OCOTP
