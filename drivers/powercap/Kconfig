	  The power capping sysfs interface allows kernel subsystems to expose power
	  capping settings to user space in a consistent way.  Usually, it consists
	  of multiple control types that determine which settings may be exposed and
	  power zones representing parts of the system that can be subject to power
	  capping.

	  If you want this code to be compiled in, say Y here.

	---help---
	  This enables support for the Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL)
	  technology which allows power limits to be enforced and monitored on
	  modern Intel processors (Sandy Bridge and later).

	  In RAPL, the platform level settings are divided into domains for
	  fine grained control. These domains include processor package, DRAM
	  controller, CPU core (Power Plance 0), graphics uncore (Power Plane
	  1), etc.
