	  X86 tablets which ship with Android as (part of) the factory image
	  typically have various problems with their DSDTs. The factory kernels
	  shipped on these devices typically have device addresses and GPIOs
	  hardcoded in the kernel, rather than specified in their DSDT.

	  With the DSDT containing a random collection of devices which may or
	  may not actually be present. This driver contains various fixes for
	  such tablets, including instantiating kernel devices for devices which
	  are missing from the DSDT.

	  If you have a x86 Android tablet say Y or M here, for a generic x86
	  distro configuration say M here.
