	  Host System Management Port (HSMP) interface is a mailbox interface
	  between the x86 core and the System Management Unit (SMU) firmware.
	  The driver provides a way for user space tools to monitor and manage
	  system management functionality on EPYC and MI300A server CPUs
	  from AMD.

	  This option supports ACPI based probing.
	  You may enable this, if your platform BIOS provides an ACPI object
	  as described in amd_hsmp.rst document.

	  If you choose to compile this driver as a module the module will be
	  called hsmp_acpi.
