	tristate "WMI"
	depends on ACPI
	help
	  This driver adds support for the ACPI-WMI (Windows Management
	  Instrumentation) mapper device (PNP0C14) found on some systems.

	  ACPI-WMI is a proprietary extension to ACPI to expose parts of the
	  ACPI firmware to userspace - this is done through various vendor
	  defined methods and data blocks in a PNP0C14 device, which are then
	  made available for userspace to call.

	  The implementation of this in Linux currently only exposes this to
	  other kernel space drivers.

	  This driver is a required dependency to build the firmware specific
	  drivers needed on many machines, including Acer and HP laptops.

	  It is safe to enable this driver even if your DSDT doesn't define
	  any ACPI-WMI devices.

	  Overriding LED state on ThinkPads can mask important

	  LED control on the ThinkPad is write-only (with very few

	  server running, phase of the moon, and the current mood of
	  Schroedinger's cat.  If you can use X.org's RandR to control
	  your ThinkPad's video output ports instead of this feature,
	  don't think twice: do it and say N here to save memory and avoid
	  bad interactions with X.org.

	  NOTE: access to this feature is limited to processes with the
	  CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, to avoid local DoS issues in platforms

	  need to do NVRAM polling to support any of the hot keys you use,
	  unselecting this option will save about 1kB of memory.

	  ThinkPads T40 and newer, R52 and newer, and X31 and newer are
	  unlikely to need NVRAM polling in their latest BIOS versions.

	  NVRAM polling can detect at most the following keys: ThinkPad/Access
	  IBM, Zoom, Switch Display (fn+F7), ThinkLight, Volume up/down/mute,
	  Brightness up/down, Display Expand (fn+F8), Hibernate (fn+F12).

	  This driver adds support for access to certain system settings
	  on "legacy free" Toshiba laptops.  These laptops can be recognized by
	  their lack of a BIOS setup menu and APM support.

	  On these machines, all system configuration is handled through the
	  ACPI.  This driver is required for access to controls not covered
	  by the general ACPI drivers, such as LCD brightness, video output,
	  etc.

	  This driver differs from the non-ACPI Toshiba laptop driver (located
	  under "Processor type and features") in several aspects.
	  Configuration is accessed by reading and writing text files in the
	  /proc tree instead of by program interface to /dev.  Furthermore, no
	  power management functions are exposed, as those are handled by the
	  general ACPI drivers.

	  More information about this driver is available at

	  detects a sudden move or a harsh vibration, as well as an
	  ACPI notify event 0x81 whenever the movement or vibration has
	  been stabilized.
