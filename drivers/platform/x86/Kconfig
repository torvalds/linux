	---help---
	  This is a driver for the IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad laptops. It adds
	  support for Fn-Fx key combinations, Bluetooth control, video
	  output switching, ThinkLight control, UltraBay eject and more.
	  For more information about this driver see
	  <file:Documentation/laptops/thinkpad-acpi.txt> and
	  <http://ibm-acpi.sf.net/> .

	  This driver was formerly known as ibm-acpi.

	  Extra functionality will be available if the rfkill (CONFIG_RFKILL)
	  and/or ALSA (CONFIG_SND) subsystems are available in the kernel.
	  Note that if you want ThinkPad-ACPI to be built-in instead of
	  modular, ALSA and rfkill will also have to be built-in.

	  If you have an IBM or Lenovo ThinkPad laptop, say Y or M here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_ALSA_SUPPORT
	bool "Console audio control ALSA interface"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	depends on SND
	depends on SND = y || THINKPAD_ACPI = SND
	default y
	---help---
	  Enables monitoring of the built-in console audio output control
	  (headphone and speakers), which is operated by the mute and (in
	  some ThinkPad models) volume hotkeys.

	  If this option is enabled, ThinkPad-ACPI will export an ALSA card
	  with a single read-only mixer control, which should be used for
	  on-screen-display feedback purposes by the Desktop Environment.

	  Optionally, the driver will also allow software control (the
	  ALSA mixer will be made read-write).  Please refer to the driver
	  documentation for details.

	  All IBM models have both volume and mute control.  Newer Lenovo
	  models only have mute control (the volume hotkeys are just normal
	  keys and volume control is done through the main HDA mixer).

config THINKPAD_ACPI_DEBUGFACILITIES
	bool "Maintainer debug facilities"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables extra stuff in the thinkpad-acpi which is completely useless
	  for normal use.  Read the driver source to find out what it does.

	  Say N here, unless you were told by a kernel maintainer to do
	  otherwise.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_DEBUG
	bool "Verbose debug mode"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default n
	---help---
	  Enables extra debugging information, at the expense of a slightly
	  increase in driver size.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_UNSAFE_LEDS
	bool "Allow control of important LEDs (unsafe)"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default n
	---help---
	  Overriding LED state on ThinkPads can mask important
	  firmware alerts (like critical battery condition), or misled
	  the user into damaging the hardware (undocking or ejecting
	  the bay while buses are still active), etc.

	  LED control on the ThinkPad is write-only (with very few
	  exceptions on very ancient models), which makes it
	  impossible to know beforehand if important information will
	  be lost when one changes LED state.

	  Users that know what they are doing can enable this option
	  and the driver will allow control of every LED, including
	  the ones on the dock stations.

	  Never enable this option on a distribution kernel.

	  Say N here, unless you are building a kernel for your own
	  use, and need to control the important firmware LEDs.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_VIDEO
	bool "Video output control support"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default y
	---help---
	  Allows the thinkpad_acpi driver to provide an interface to control
	  the various video output ports.

	  This feature often won't work well, depending on ThinkPad model,
	  display state, video output devices in use, whether there is a X
	  server running, phase of the moon, and the current mood of
	  Schroedinger's cat.  If you can use X.org's RandR to control
	  your ThinkPad's video output ports instead of this feature,
	  don't think twice: do it and say N here to save memory and avoid
	  bad interactions with X.org.

	  NOTE: access to this feature is limited to processes with the
	  CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, to avoid local DoS issues in platforms
	  where it interacts badly with X.org.

	  If you are not sure, say Y here but do try to check if you could
	  be using X.org RandR instead.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_HOTKEY_POLL
	bool "Support NVRAM polling for hot keys"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default y
	---help---
	  Some thinkpad models benefit from NVRAM polling to detect a few of
	  the hot key press events.  If you know your ThinkPad model does not
	  need to do NVRAM polling to support any of the hot keys you use,
	  unselecting this option will save about 1kB of memory.

	  ThinkPads T40 and newer, R52 and newer, and X31 and newer are
	  unlikely to need NVRAM polling in their latest BIOS versions.

	  NVRAM polling can detect at most the following keys: ThinkPad/Access
	  IBM, Zoom, Switch Display (fn+F7), ThinkLight, Volume up/down/mute,
	  Brightness up/down, Display Expand (fn+F8), Hibernate (fn+F12).

	  If you are not sure, say Y here.  The driver enables polling only if
	  it is strictly necessary to do so.

config SENSORS_HDAPS
	tristate "Thinkpad Hard Drive Active Protection System (hdaps)"
	depends on INPUT && X86
	select INPUT_POLLDEV
	default n
	help
	  This driver provides support for the IBM Hard Drive Active Protection
	  System (hdaps), which provides an accelerometer and other misc. data.
	  ThinkPads starting with the R50, T41, and X40 are supported.  The
	  accelerometer data is readable via sysfs.

	  This driver also provides an absolute input class device, allowing
	  the laptop to act as a pinball machine-esque joystick.

	  If your ThinkPad is not recognized by the driver, please update to latest
	  BIOS. This is especially the case for some R52 ThinkPads.

	  Say Y here if you have an applicable laptop and want to experience
	  the awesome power of hdaps.

config ACPI_WMI
	tristate "WMI"
	depends on ACPI
	help
	  This driver adds support for the ACPI-WMI (Windows Management
	  Instrumentation) mapper device (PNP0C14) found on some systems.

	  ACPI-WMI is a proprietary extension to ACPI to expose parts of the
	  ACPI firmware to userspace - this is done through various vendor
	  defined methods and data blocks in a PNP0C14 device, which are then
	  made available for userspace to call.

	  The implementation of this in Linux currently only exposes this to
	  other kernel space drivers.

	  This driver is a required dependency to build the firmware specific
	  drivers needed on many machines, including Acer and HP laptops.

	  It is safe to enable this driver even if your DSDT doesn't define
	  any ACPI-WMI devices.

config ACPI_ASUS

	depends on ACPI
	select BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
	---help---
	  This driver provides support for extra features of ACPI-compatible
	  ASUS laptops. As some of Medion laptops are made by ASUS, it may also
	  support some Medion laptops (such as 9675 for example).  It makes all
	  the extra buttons generate standard ACPI events that go through
	  /proc/acpi/events, and (on some models) adds support for changing the
	  display brightness and output, switching the LCD backlight on and off,
	  and most importantly, allows you to blink those fancy LEDs intended
	  for reporting mail and wireless status.

	  Note: display switching code is currently considered EXPERIMENTAL,
	  toying with these values may even lock your machine.

	  All settings are changed via /proc/acpi/asus directory entries. Owner
	  and group for these entries can be set with asus_uid and asus_gid
	  parameters.

	  More information and a userspace daemon for handling the extra buttons
	  at <http://acpi4asus.sf.net>.

	  If you have an ACPI-compatible ASUS laptop, say Y or M here. This

	  This driver adds support for access to certain system settings
	  on "legacy free" Toshiba laptops.  These laptops can be recognized by
	  their lack of a BIOS setup menu and APM support.

	  On these machines, all system configuration is handled through the
	  ACPI.  This driver is required for access to controls not covered
	  by the general ACPI drivers, such as LCD brightness, video output,
	  etc.

	  This driver differs from the non-ACPI Toshiba laptop driver (located
	  under "Processor type and features") in several aspects.
	  Configuration is accessed by reading and writing text files in the
	  /proc tree instead of by program interface to /dev.  Furthermore, no
	  power management functions are exposed, as those are handled by the
	  general ACPI drivers.

	  More information about this driver is available at

	 If the proper BIOS support is found the driver will load and create
	 /sys/devices/system/ibm_rtl/.  The "state" variable will indicate
	 whether or not the BIOS is in PRTM.
