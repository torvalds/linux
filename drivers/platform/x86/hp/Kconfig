	  hp::hddprotect. For more information on the feature, refer to
	  Documentation/misc-devices/lis3lv02d.rst.

	  This driver enables administrators to securely manage BIOS settings
	  using digital certificates and public-key cryptography that eliminate
	  the need for passwords for both remote and local management. It supports
	  changing BIOS settings on many HP machines from 2018 and newer without
	  the use of any additional software.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called hp-bioscfg.
