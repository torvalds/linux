	  This option enables support for the ACPI-WMI driver core.

	  The ACPI-WMI interface is a proprietary extension of ACPI allowing
	  the platform firmware to expose WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)
	  objects used for managing various aspects of the underlying system.
	  Mapping between ACPI control methods and WMI objects happens through
	  special mapper devices (PNP0C14) defined inside the ACPI tables.

	  Enabling this option is necessary for building the vendor specific
	  ACPI-WMI client drivers for Acer, Dell an HP machines (among others).

	  It is safe to enable this option even for machines that do not contain
	  any ACPI-WMI mapper devices at all.

	help
	  Say Y here to force the WMI driver core to use the old WMI device naming
	  scheme when creating WMI devices. Doing so might be necessary for some
	  userspace applications but will cause the registration of WMI devices with
	  the same GUID to fail in some corner cases.
