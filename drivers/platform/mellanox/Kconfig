	  This driver allows access to Mellanox programmable device register
	  space through sysfs interface. The sets of registers for sysfs access
	  are defined per system type bases and include the registers related
	  to system resets operation, system reset causes monitoring and some
	  kinds of mux selection.

	  The Mellanox BlueField firmware implements functionality to
	  request swapping the primary and alternate eMMC boot partition,
	  and to set up a watchdog that can undo that swap if the system
	  does not boot up correctly. This driver provides sysfs access
	  to the userspace tools, to be used in conjunction with the eMMC
	  device driver to do necessary initial swap of the boot partition.
