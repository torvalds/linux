	select VHOST
	select VHOST_RING
	---help---
	  This kernel module can be loaded in host kernel to accelerate
	  guest networking with virtio_net. Not to be confused with virtio_net
	  module itself which needs to be loaded in guest kernel.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called vhost_net.

	tristate "VHOST_SCSI TCM fabric driver"
	depends on TARGET_CORE && EVENTFD && m
	select VHOST
	select VHOST_RING
	default n
	---help---
	Say M here to enable the vhost_scsi TCM fabric module
	for use with virtio-scsi guests

config VHOST_RING
	tristate
	---help---
	  This option is selected by any driver which needs to access
	  the host side of a virtio ring.

config VHOST
	tristate
	---help---
	  This option is selected by any driver which needs to access
	  the core of vhost.

config VHOST_CROSS_ENDIAN_LEGACY
	bool "Cross-endian support for vhost"
	default n
	---help---
	  This option allows vhost to support guests with a different byte
	  ordering from host while using legacy virtio.

	  Userspace programs can control the feature using the
	  VHOST_SET_VRING_ENDIAN and VHOST_GET_VRING_ENDIAN ioctls.

	  This is only useful on a few platforms (ppc64 and arm64). Since it
	  adds some overhead, it is disabled by default.

	  If unsure, say "N".
