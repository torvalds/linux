.Sh NAME
.Nm pkcs5_pbkdf2
.Nd password-based key derivation function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libutil
.In util.h
.Ft int
.Fn pkcs5_pbkdf2 "const char *pass" "size_t pass_len" "const char *salt" \
    "size_t salt_len" "u_int8_t *key" "size_t key_len" "u_int rounds"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function converts a password into a byte array suitable for use as
an encryption key.
The password and salt values are combined and repeatedly hashed
.Ar rounds
times.
The salt value should be randomly generated beforehand.
The repeated hashing is designed to thwart discovery of the key via
password guessing attacks.
The higher the number of rounds, the slower each attempt will be.
A minimum value of at least 1000 is recommended.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn pkcs5_pbkdf2
function returns 0 to indicate success and -1 for failure.
