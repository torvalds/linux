.Ft void
.Fn logwtmp "const char *line" "const char *name" "const char *host"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn login ,
.Fn logout ,
and
.Fn logwtmp
functions operate on the database of current users in
.Pa /var/run/utmp
and on the logfile
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
of logins and logouts.
.Pp
The
.Fn login
function updates the
.Pa /var/run/utmp
and
.Pa /var/log/wtmp
files with user information contained in
.Fa ut .
.Pp
The
.Fn logout
function removes the entry from
.Pa /var/run/utmp
corresponding to the device
.Fa line .
.Pp
The
.Fn logwtmp
function adds an entry to
.Pa /var/log/wtmp .

will add the appropriate entry for

during a login,
.Fn logwtmp
is usually used for logouts.

returns non-zero if it was able to find and delete an entry for
.Fa line ,
and zero if there is no entry for
.Fa line
in
.Pa /var/run/utmp .
