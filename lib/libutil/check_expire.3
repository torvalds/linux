.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

function is called by a

Authentication login script to

expired longer than
.Dq password-dead
seconds (see
.Xr login.conf 5 ) ,
the user will be able to log in one last time to change the password.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn login_check_expire
function returns 0 if the user's password has not expired, and 1 if it has
expired or if an error occurred.
.br
Status and error messages are passed
back to the login script caller via the back channel,
.Fa back .
