.Sh NAME
.Nm kld_isloaded ,
.Nm kld_load
.Nd kld utility functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libutil
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libutil.h
.Ft int
.Fn kld_isloaded "const char *name"
.Ft int
.Fn kld_load "const char *name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions facilitate loading kernel modules from userland
applications.
.Pp
The
.Fn kld_isloaded
function takes a name and returns a non-zero value if a module of that
name is currently loaded.
The name can be either the name of a module file
.Pq Pa cpufreq.ko ,
the same name without the
.Pa .ko
extension
.Pq Pa cpufreq ,
or the name of a module contained within that file
.Pq Pa cpu/ichss .
Only the latter will return correct results if the module is compiled
into the kernel.
.Pp
The
.Fn kld_load
function is a simple wrapper around the
.Xr kldload 2
function.
It returns zero if and only if the corresponding
.Fn kldload
call succeeded or returned
.Er EEXIST
(signifying that the requested module was already loaded).
