.Sh NAME
.Nm ober_oid_cmp ,
.Nm ober_oid2ber ,
.Nm ober_string2oid
.Nd OID helper functions for the BER library
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libutil
.In sys/types.h
.In ber.h
.Ft int
.Fn "ober_oid_cmp" "struct ber_oid *a" "struct ber_oid *b"
.Ft size_t
.Fn "ober_oid2ber" "struct ber_oid *oid" "u_int8_t *buf" "size_t size"
.Ft int
.Fn "ober_string2oid" "const char *string" "struct ber_oid *oid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Object Identifiers are commonly used in ASN.1-based protocols.
These functions provide an interface to parse OIDs.
For internal representation of OIDs, the following structure
.Vt struct ber_oid
is being used:
.Bd -literal
#define BER_MIN_OID_LEN		2
#define BER_MAX_OID_LEN		64

struct ber_oid {
	u_int32_t	bo_id[BER_MAX_OID_LEN + 1];
	size_t		bo_n;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn ober_oid2ber
and
.Fn ober_string2oid
functions may be used to convert from and to
.Vt struct ber_oid .
.Pp
.Fn ober_oid_cmp
may be used to compare two
.Vt ber_oid
structures.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn ober_oid2ber
returns the number of bytes written or 0 on failure.
.Pp
.Fn ober_string2oid
returns 0 on success or -1 on failure.
.Pp
.Fn ober_oid_cmp
returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, according to whether
the oid
.Fa a
is greater than, equal to, or less than the oid
.Fa b .
If the shortest length from
.Fa a
and
.Fa b
matches
the weight of the integer is 2, else it is 1.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ober_add_string 3 ,
.Xr ober_get_string 3 ,
.Xr ober_read_elements 3 ,
.Xr ober_set_header 3
.Sh HISTORY
These functions first appeared as internal functions in
.Xr snmpd 8
in
.Ox 4.2
and were moved to libutil in
.Ox 6.6 .
