.Dt PW_LOCK 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pw_lock ,
.Nm pw_mkdb ,
.Nm pw_abort
.Nd passwd file update functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libutil
.In util.h
.Ft int
.Fn pw_lock "int retries"
.Ft int
.Fn pw_mkdb "char *username" "int pwflags"
.Ft void
.Fn pw_abort void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pw_lock ,
.Fn pw_mkdb ,
and
.Fn pw_abort
functions allow a program to update the system passwd database.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_lock
function attempts to lock the passwd database by creating the file
.Pa /etc/ptmp ,
and returns the file descriptor of that file.
If
.Fa retries
is greater than zero,
.Fn pw_lock
will try multiple times to open
.Pa /etc/ptmp ,
waiting one second between tries.
In addition to being a lock file,
.Pa /etc/ptmp
will also hold the contents of the new passwd file.
A different lock file can be specified with
.Xr pw_file 3 .
.Pp
.Xr pw_init 3
must be called before
.Fn pw_lock .
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_mkdb
function updates the passwd file from the contents of
.Pa /etc/ptmp
via
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8 .
If a
.Fa username
is specified, only the record for the specified user will be updated.
The
.Fa pwflags
are specified by OR'ing the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width _PASSWORD_SECUREONLY -offset "xxxx" -compact
.It Dv _PASSWORD_SECUREONLY
only update the secure database file
.Pq Pa /etc/spwd.db .
.It Dv _PASSWORD_OMITV7
do not update the legacy password file
.Pq Pa /etc/passwd .
.El
.Pp
By default the secure and insecure password databases and
the legacy password file
.Pa /etc/passwd
are updated.
You should finish writing to and close the file descriptor returned by
.Fn pw_lock
before calling
.Fn pw_mkdb .
If
.Fn pw_mkdb
fails and you do not wish to retry, you should make sure to call
.Fn pw_abort
to clean up the lock file.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_abort
function aborts a passwd file update by deleting
.Pa /etc/ptmp .
The passwd database remains unchanged.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn pw_lock
function returns \-1 on error and sets
.Va errno .
The
.Fn pw_mkdb
function returns \-1 if it is unable to complete properly.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/master.passwdXXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/master.passwd
Current password file.
.It Pa /etc/passwd
Legacy password file.
.It Pa /etc/ptmp
Password lock file.
.It Pa /etc/pwd.db
Insecure password database file.
.It Pa /etc/spwd.db
Secure password database file.
.El
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL

was called before
.Xr pw_init 3 .
.El
.Pp
.Fn pw_lock
may also fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the routine
.Xr open 2 .
