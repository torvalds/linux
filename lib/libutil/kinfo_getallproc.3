.Dt KINFO_GETALLPROC 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kinfo_getallproc
.Nd function for getting process information of all processes from kernel
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libutil
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/user.h
.In libutil.h
.Ft struct kinfo_proc *
.Fn kinfo_getallproc "int *cntp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function is used for obtaining process information of all processes from
the kernel.
.Pp
The
.Ar cntp
field is a pointer containing the number of process structures returned.
This function is a wrapper around
.Xr sysctl 3
with the
.Dv KERN_PROC_PROC
mib.
While the kernel returns a packed structure, this function expands the
data into a fixed record format.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success the
.Fn kinfo_getallproc
function returns a pointer to
.Ar cntp
.Vt struct kinfo_proc
structures as defined by
.In sys/user.h .
The pointer was obtained by an internal call to
.Xr malloc 3
and must be freed by the caller with a call to
.Xr free 3 .
On failure the
.Fn kinfo_getallproc
function returns
.Dv NULL .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr free 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Xr sysctl 3
