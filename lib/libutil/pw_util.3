.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pw_copy
function reads a password file from
.Vt ffd
and writes it back out to
.Vt tfd
possibly with modifications:
.Bl -dash
.It
If
.Fa pw
is
.Dv NULL
and
.Fa oldpw
is not
.Dv NULL ,
then the record represented by
.Fa oldpw
will not be copied (corresponding to user deletion).
.It
If
.Fa pw
and
.Fa oldpw
are not
.Dv NULL
then the record corresponding to
.Fa pw
will be replaced by the record corresponding to
.Fa oldpw .
.It
If
.Vt pw
is set and
.Vt oldpw
is
.Dv NULL
then the record corresponding to
.Vt pw
will be appended (corresponding to user addition).
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_copy
function returns -1 in case of failure otherwise 0.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_dup
function duplicates the
.Vt struct passwd
pointed to by
.Fa pw
and returns a pointer to the copy, or
.Dv NULL
in case of failure.
The new
.Vt struct passwd
is allocated with
.Xr malloc 3 ,
and it is the caller's responsibility to free it with
.Xr free 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_edit
function invokes the command specified by the
.Ev EDITOR
environment variable (or
.Pa /usr/bin/vi
if
.Ev EDITOR
is not defined)
on a temporary copy of the master password file created by
.Fn pw_tmp .
If the file was modified,
.Fn pw_edit
installs it and regenerates the password database.
The
.Fn pw_edit
function returns -1 in case of failure, 0 if the file was not modified,
and a non-zero positive number if the file was modified and successfully
installed.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_equal
function compares two
.Vt struct passwd
and returns 0 if they are equal.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_fini
function destroy the temporary file created by
.Fn pw_tmp
if any,
kills any running instance of
.Ev EDITOR
executed by
.Fn pw_edit
if any,
and closes the lock created by
.Fn pw_lock
if any.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_init
initializes the static variable representing the path to a password file.
.Fa dir
is the directory where the password file is located.
If set to
.Dv NULL ,
it will default to
.Pa /etc .
.Fa master
is the name of the password file.
If set to
.Dv NULL?
it will default to
.Pa master.passwd
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_initpwd
function initializes the
.Vt passwd
struct to canonical values.
The entire structure is zeroed, then
.Va pw_uid
and
.Va pw_gid
are set to -1, and all string pointers are set to point at
an internally-defined zero-length string.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_make
function creates a properly formatted
.Bx
.Xr passwd 5
line from a
.Vt struct passwd ,
and returns a pointer to the resulting string.
The string is allocated with
.Xr malloc 3 ,
and it is the caller's responsibility to free it with
.Xr free 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_make_v7
function creates a properly formatted
.Ux V7
.Xr passwd 5
line from a
.Vt struct passwd ,
and returns a pointer to the resulting string.
The string is allocated with
.Xr malloc 3 ,
and it is the caller's responsibility to free it with
.Xr free 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_mkdb
function regenerates the password database by running
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8 .
If
.Fa user
only the record corresponding to that user will be updated.
The
.Fn pw_mkdb
function returns 0 in case of success and -1 in case of failure.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_lock
function locks the master password file.
It returns a file descriptor to the master password file on success
and -1 on failure.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_scan
function is a wrapper around the internal libc function
.Fn __pw_scan .
It scans the master password file for a line corresponding to the
.Fa line
provided and return a
.Vt struct passwd
if it matched an existing record.
In case of failure, it returns
.Dv NULL .
Otherwise, it returns a pointer to a
.Vt struct passwd
containing the matching record.
The
.Vt struct passwd
is allocated with
.Xr malloc 3 ,
and it is the caller's responsibility to free it with
.Xr free 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_tempname
function returns the temporary name of the masterfile created via
.Fn pw_tmp .
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_tmp
creates and opens a presumably safe temporary password file.
If
.Fa mfd
is a file descriptor to an open password file, it will be read and
written back to the temporary password file.
Otherwise if should be set -1.
The
.Fn pw_tmp
returns an open file descriptor to the temporary password file or -1 in case of
failure.
