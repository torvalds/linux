.Dt HEXDUMP 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm hexdump
.Nd "dump a block of bytes to standard out in hexadecimal form"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libutil.h
.Ft void
.Fn hexdump "void *ptr" "int length" "const char *hdr" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn hexdump
function prints an array of bytes to standard out in hexadecimal form,
along with the ASCII representation of the bytes, if possible.
By default, each line of output will start with an offset count, followed by 16
hexadecimal values, followed by 16 ASCII characters.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fa ptr
Pointer to the array of bytes to print.
It does not need to be
.Dv NUL Ns
-terminated.
.It Fa length
Number of bytes to print.
.It Fa hdr
Pointer to a
.Dv NUL Ns
-terminated character string that will be prepended to each
line of output.
A value of
.Dv NULL
implies that no header will be printed.
.It Fa flags
Flags for controlling the formatting of the output.
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv HD_OMIT_COUNT"
.It Bits 0-7
Integer value of the number of bytes to display on each line.
A value of 0 implies that the default value of 16 will be used.
.It Bits 8-15
Character ASCII value to use as the separator for the hexadecimal output.
A value of 0 implies that the default value of 32
.Pq ASCII space
will be used.
.It Dv HD_OMIT_COUNT
Do not print the offset column at the beginning of each line.
.It Dv HD_OMIT_HEX
Do not print the hexadecimal values on each line.
.It Dv HD_OMIT_CHARS
Do not print the character values on each line.
