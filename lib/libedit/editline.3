.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides generic line editing, history and tokenization functions,
similar to those found in
.Xr sh 1 .
.Pp
These functions are available in the
.Nm libedit
library (which needs the
.Nm libtermcap
library).
Programs should be linked with
.Fl ledit ltermcap .
.Pp
The
.Nm
library respects the
.Ev LC_CTYPE
locale set by the application program and never uses
.Xr setlocale 3
to change the locale.
The only locales supported are UTF-8 and the default C or POSIX locale.
If any other locale is set, behaviour is undefined.
.Sh LINE EDITING FUNCTIONS
The line editing functions use a common data structure,
.Fa EditLine ,
which is created by
.Fn el_init
or
.Fn el_init_fd
and freed by
.Fn el_end .
.Pp
The wide-character functions behave the same way as their narrow
counterparts.
.Pp
The following functions are available:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fn el_init
Initialize the line editor, and return a data structure
to be used by all other line editing functions, or
.Dv NULL
on failure.
.Fa prog
is the name of the invoking program, used when reading the
.Xr editrc 5
file to determine which settings to use.
.Fa fin ,
.Fa fout
and
.Fa ferr
are the input, output, and error streams (respectively) to use.
In this documentation, references to
.Dq the tty
are actually to this input/output stream combination.
.It Fn el_init_fd
Like
.Fn el_init
but allows specifying file descriptors for the
.Xr stdio 3
corresponding streams, in case those were created with
.Xr funopen 3 .
.It Fn el_end
Clean up and finish with
.Fa e ,
assumed to have been created with
.Fn el_init
or
.Fn el_init_fd .
.It Fn el_reset
Reset the tty and the parser.
This should be called after an error which may have upset the tty's
state.
.It Fn el_gets
Read a line from the tty.
.Fa count
is modified to contain the number of characters read.
Returns the line read if successful, or
.Dv NULL
if no characters were read or if an error occurred.
If an error occurred,
.Fa count
is set to \-1 and
.Dv errno
contains the error code that caused it.
The return value may not remain valid across calls to
.Fn el_gets
and must be copied if the data is to be retained.
.It Fn el_wgetc
Read a wide character from the tty, respecting the current locale,
or from the input stream written by
.Fn el_wpush
and
.Fn el_push
if that is not empty, and store it in
.Fa ch .
If an invalid or incomplete character is found, it is discarded,
.Va errno
is set to
.Er EILSEQ ,
and the next character is read and stored in
.Fa ch .
Returns 1 if a valid character was read, 0 on end of file, or \-1 on
.Xr read 2
failure.
In the latter case,
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.It Fn el_getc
Read a wide character as described for
.Fn el_wgetc
and return 0 on end of file or \-1 on failure.
If the wide character can be represented as a single-byte character,
convert it with
.Xr wctob 3 ,
store the result in
.Fa ch ,
and return 1; otherwise, set
.Va errno
to
.Er ERANGE
and return \-1.
In the C or POSIX locale, this simply reads a byte, but for any other
locale, including UTF-8, this is rarely useful.
.It Fn el_push
Pushes
.Fa str
back onto the input stream.
This is used by the macro expansion mechanism.
Refer to the description of
.Ic bind
.Fl s
in
.Xr editrc 5
for more information.
.It Fn el_parse
Parses the
.Fa argv
array (which is
.Fa argc
elements in size)
to execute builtin
.Nm
commands.
If the command is prefixed with
.Dq prog :
then
.Fn el_parse
will only execute the command if
.Dq prog
matches the
.Fa prog
argument supplied to
.Fn el_init .
The return value is
\-1 if the command is unknown,
0 if there was no error or
.Dq prog
didn't match, or
1 if the command returned an error.
Refer to
.Xr editrc 5
for more information.
.It Fn el_set
Set
.Nm
parameters.
.Fa op
determines which parameter to set, and each operation has its
own parameter list.
Returns 0 on success, \-1 on failure.
.Pp
The following values for
.Fa op
are supported, along with the required argument list:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Dv EL_PROMPT , Fa "char *(*f)(EditLine *)"
Define prompt printing function as
.Fa f ,
which is to return a string that contains the prompt.
.It Dv EL_PROMPT_ESC , Fa "char *(*f)(EditLine *)" , Fa "char c"
Same as
.Dv EL_PROMPT ,
but the
.Fa c
argument indicates the start/stop literal prompt character.
.Pp
If a start/stop literal character is found in the prompt, the
character itself
is not printed, but characters after it are printed directly to the
terminal without affecting the state of the current line.
A subsequent second start/stop literal character ends this behavior.
This is typically used to embed literal escape sequences that change the
color/style of the terminal in the prompt.
.Dv 0
unsets it.
.It Dv EL_REFRESH
Re-display the current line on the next terminal line.
.It Dv EL_RPROMPT , Fa "char *(*f)(EditLine *)"
Define right side prompt printing function as
.Fa f ,
which is to return a string that contains the prompt.
.It Dv EL_RPROMPT_ESC , Fa "char *(*f)(EditLine *)" , Fa "char c"
Define the right prompt printing function but with a literal escape character.
.It Dv EL_TERMINAL , Fa "const char *type"

is
.Dv NULL .
.It Dv EL_EDITOR , Fa "const char *mode"
Set editing mode to
.Fa mode ,
which must be one of
.Dq emacs
or
.Dq vi .
.It Dv EL_SIGNAL , Fa "int flag"
If
.Fa flag
is non-zero,
.Nm
will install its own signal handler for the following signals when
reading command input:
.Dv SIGCONT ,
.Dv SIGHUP ,
.Dv SIGINT ,
.Dv SIGQUIT ,
.Dv SIGSTOP ,
.Dv SIGTERM ,
.Dv SIGTSTP ,
and
.Dv SIGWINCH .
Otherwise, the current signal handlers will be used.

Perform the
.Ic bind
builtin command.
Refer to
.Xr editrc 5
for more information.
.It Dv EL_ECHOTC , Fa "const char *" , Fa "..." , Dv NULL

.Ic echotc
builtin command.
Refer to
.Xr editrc 5
for more information.
.It Dv EL_SETTC , Fa "const char *" , Fa "..." , Dv NULL

.Ic settc
builtin command.
Refer to
.Xr editrc 5
for more information.
.It Dv EL_SETTY , Fa "const char *" , Fa "..." , Dv NULL

.Ic setty
builtin command.
Refer to
.Xr editrc 5
for more information.
.It Dv EL_TELLTC , Fa "const char *" , Fa "..." , Dv NULL

.Fn func ,
referred to as
.Fa name
which is invoked when a key which is bound to
.Fa name
is entered.
.Fa help
is a description of
.Fa name .
At invocation time,
.Fa ch
is the key which caused the invocation.
The return value of
.Fn func
should be one of:
.Bl -tag -width "CC_REDISPLAY"
.It Dv CC_NORM
Add a normal character.
.It Dv CC_NEWLINE
End of line was entered.
.It Dv CC_EOF
EOF was entered.

.Fa ptr
should be the value returned by
.Fn history_init .
.It Dv EL_EDITMODE , Fa "int flag"
If
.Fa flag
is non-zero,
editing is enabled (the default).
Note that this is only an indication, and does not
affect the operation of

At this time, it is the caller's responsibility to
check this
(using
.Fn el_get )
to determine if editing should be enabled or not.
.It Dv EL_UNBUFFERED , Fa "int flag"
If
.Fa flag
is zero,
unbuffered mode is disabled (the default).
In unbuffered mode,
.Fn el_gets
will return immediately after processing a single character.
.It Dv EL_GETCFN , Fa "int (*f)(EditLine *, char *c)"
Define the character reading function as
.Fa f ,
which is to return the number of characters read and store them in
.Fa c .
This function is called internally by
.Fn el_gets

.Sh BUGS
At this time, it is the responsibility of the caller to
check the result of the
.Dv EL_EDITMODE
operation of
.Fn el_get
(after an
.Fn el_source
or
.Fn el_parse )
to determine if
.Nm
should be used for further input.
I.e.,
.Dv EL_EDITMODE
is purely an indication of the result of the most recent
.Xr editrc 5
.Ic edit
command.
