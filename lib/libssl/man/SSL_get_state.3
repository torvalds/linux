.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn SSL_get_state
returns an encoded representation of the current state of the SSL
state machine.
.Fn SSL_state
is a deprecated alias for
.Fn SSL_get_state .
.Pp
The following bits may be set:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dv SSL_ST_ACCEPT
This bit is set by
.Xr SSL_accept 3
and by
.Xr SSL_set_accept_state 3 .
It indicates that
.Fa ssl
is set up for server mode and no client initiated the TLS handshake yet.
The function
.Fn SSL_in_accept_init
returns non-zero if this bit is set or 0 otherwise.
.It Dv SSL_ST_BEFORE
This bit is set by the
.Xr SSL_accept 3 ,
.Xr SSL_connect 3 ,
.Xr SSL_set_accept_state 3 ,
and
.Xr SSL_set_connect_state 3
functions.
It indicates that the TLS handshake was not initiated yet.
The function
.Fn SSL_in_before
returns non-zero if this bit is set or 0 otherwise.
.It Dv SSL_ST_CONNECT
This bit is set by
.Xr SSL_connect 3
and by
.Xr SSL_set_connect_state 3 .
It indicates that
.Fa ssl
is set up for client mode and no TLS handshake was initiated yet.
The function
.Fn SSL_in_connect_init
returns non-zero if this bit is set or 0 otherwise.
.El
.Pp
The following masks can be used:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dv SSL_ST_INIT
Set if
.Dv SSL_ST_ACCEPT
or
.Dv SSL_ST_CONNECT
is set.
The function
.Fn SSL_in_init
returns a non-zero value if one of these is set or 0 otherwise.
.It Dv SSL_ST_MASK
This mask includes all bits except
.Dv SSL_ST_ACCEPT ,
.Dv SSL_ST_BEFORE ,
and
.Dv SSL_ST_CONNECT .
.It Dv SSL_ST_OK
The state is set to this value when a connection is established.
The function
.Fn SSL_is_init_finished
returns a non-zero value if the state equals this constant, or 0 otherwise.
.It Dv SSL_ST_RENEGOTIATE
The program is about to renegotiate, for example when entering
.Xr SSL_read 3
or
.Xr SSL_write 3
right after
.Xr SSL_renegotiate 3
was called.
.El
.Pp
The meaning of other bits is protocol-dependent.
Application programs usually do not need to inspect any of those
other bits.
.Pp
All these functions may be implemented as macros.
