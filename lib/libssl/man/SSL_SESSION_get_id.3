.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn SSL_SESSION_get_id
returns a pointer to the internal session ID value for the session
.Fa s .
The length of the ID in bytes is stored in
.Pf * Fa len .
The length may be 0.
The caller should not free the returned pointer directly.
.Pp
.Fn SSL_SESSION_set1_id
sets the session ID for
.Fa s
to a copy of the
.Fa sid
of length
.Fa sid_len .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn SSL_SESSION_get_id
returns a pointer to the session ID value.
.Pp
.Fn SSL_SESSION_set1_id
returns 1 for success and 0 for failure,
for example if the supplied session ID length exceeds
.Dv SSL_MAX_SSL_SESSION_ID_LENGTH .
