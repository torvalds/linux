.Sh DESCRIPTION
These routines convert between local instances of ASN.1
.Vt SSL_SESSION
objects and the PEM encoding.
.Pp
.Fn PEM_read_SSL_SESSION
reads a PEM-encoded
.Vt SSL_SESSION
object from the file
.Fa fp
and returns it.
The
.Fa cb
and
.Fa u
parameters are as described in
.Xr PEM_read_bio_PrivateKey 3 .
.Pp
.Fn PEM_read_bio_SSL_SESSION
is similar to
.Fn PEM_read_SSL_SESSION
but reads from the BIO
.Fa bp .
.Pp
.Fn PEM_write_SSL_SESSION
writes the PEM encoding of the object
.Fa a
to the file
.Fa fp .
.Pp
.Fn PEM_write_bio_SSL_SESSION
similarly writes to the BIO
.Fa bp .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn PEM_read_SSL_SESSION
and
.Fn PEM_read_bio_SSL_SESSION
return a pointer to an allocated object, which should be released by
calling
.Xr SSL_SESSION_free 3 ,
or
.Dv NULL
on error.
.Pp
.Fn PEM_write_SSL_SESSION
and
.Fn PEM_write_bio_SSL_SESSION
return the number of bytes written or 0 on error.

.Fn PEM_read_bio_SSL_SESSION
and
.Fn PEM_write_bio_SSL_SESSION
