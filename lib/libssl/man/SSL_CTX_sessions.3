.Sh NAME
.Nm SSL_CTX_sessions
.Nd access internal session cache
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libssl libcrypto
.In openssl/ssl.h
.Ft LHASH_OF(SSL_SESSION) *
.Fn SSL_CTX_sessions "SSL_CTX *ctx"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn SSL_CTX_sessions
returns a pointer to the lhash databases containing the internal session cache
for
.Fa ctx .
.Pp
The sessions in the internal session cache are kept in an
lhash-type database
(see
.Xr lh_new 3 ) .
It is possible to directly access this database, e.g., for searching.
In parallel,
the sessions form a linked list which is maintained separately from the
lhash operations,
so that the database must not be modified directly but by using the
.Xr SSL_CTX_add_session 3
family of functions.

first appeared in SSLeay 0.5.2 and has been available since
