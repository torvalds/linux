returns the default timeout value assigned to
.Vt SSL_SESSION
objects negotiated for the protocol valid for

Whenever a new session is negotiated, it is assigned a timeout value,
after which it will not be accepted for session reuse.
If the timeout value was not explicitly set using

.Fn SSL_get_default_timeout
return this hardcoded value, which is 300 seconds for all currently supported
protocols (SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLSv1).
