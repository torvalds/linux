.Sh DESCRIPTION
As of
.St -isoC-2011 ,
the C standard includes an API for writing multithreaded applications.
Since POSIX.1 already includes a threading API that is used by virtually
any multithreaded application, the interface provided by the C standard
can be considered superfluous.
.Pp
In this implementation, the threading interface is therefore implemented
as a light-weight layer on top of existing interfaces.
The functions to which these routines are mapped, are listed in the
following table.
Please refer to the documentation of the POSIX equivalent functions for
more information.

.Sh DIFFERENCES WITH POSIX EQUIVALENTS
The
.Fn thrd_exit
function returns an integer value to the thread calling
.Fn thrd_join ,
whereas the
.Fn pthread_exit
function uses a pointer.
.Pp
The mutex created by
.Fn mtx_init
can be of
.Fa type
.Dv mtx_plain
or
.Dv mtx_timed
to distinguish between a mutex that supports
.Fn mtx_timedlock .
This type can be
.Em or'd
with
.Dv mtx_recursive
to create a mutex that allows recursive acquisition.
These properties are normally set using
.Fn pthread_mutex_init Ns 's
.Fa attr
parameter.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn cnd_broadcast ,
.Fn cnd_init ,
.Fn cnd_signal ,
.Fn cnd_timedwait ,
.Fn cnd_wait ,
.Fn mtx_init ,
.Fn mtx_lock ,
.Fn mtx_timedlock ,
.Fn mtx_trylock ,
.Fn mtx_unlock ,
.Fn thrd_create ,
.Fn thrd_detach ,
.Fn thrd_equal ,
.Fn thrd_join ,
.Fn thrd_sleep ,
.Fn tss_create
and
.Fn tss_set
functions return
.Dv thrd_success .
Otherwise an error code will be returned to indicate the error.
.Pp
The
.Fn thrd_current
function returns the thread ID of the calling thread.
.Pp
The
.Fn tss_get
function returns the thread-specific data value associated with the
given
.Fa key .
If no thread-specific data value is associated with
.Fa key ,
then the value NULL is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn cnd_init
and
.Fn thrd_create
functions will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width thrd_timedout
.It Dv thrd_nomem
The system has insufficient memory.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn cnd_timedwait
and
.Fn mtx_timedlock
functions will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width thrd_timedout
.It Dv thrd_timedout
The system time has reached or exceeded the time specified in
.Fa ts
before the operation could be completed.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn mtx_trylock
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width thrd_timedout
.It Dv thrd_busy
The mutex is already locked.
.El
.Pp
In all other cases, these functions may fail by returning general error
code
.Dv thrd_error .
