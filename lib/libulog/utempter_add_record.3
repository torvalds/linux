.Nd utempter compatibility interface
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libulog
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In utempter.h
.Ft int
.Fn utempter_add_record "int fd" "const char *host"
.Ft int
.Fn utempter_remove_added_record "void"
.Ft int
.Fn utempter_remove_record "int fd"
.Ft void
.Fn addToUtmp "const char *pty" "const char *host" "int fd"
.Ft void
.Fn removeFromUtmp "void"
.Ft void
.Fn removeLineFromUtmp "const char *pty" "int fd"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn utempter_add_record
and
.Fn addToUtmp
functions add a login record to the database for the TTY belonging to
the pseudo-terminal master file descriptor
.Fa fd ,
using the username corresponding with the real user ID of the calling
process and the optional hostname
.Fa host .
These functions are equivalent to
.Xr ulog_login_pseudo 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn utempter_remove_record
and
.Fn removeLineFromUtmp
functions mark the login session as being closed for the TTY belonging
to the pseudo-terminal master file descriptor
.Fa fd .
These functions are equivalent to
.Xr ulog_logout_pseudo 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn utempter_remove_added_record
and
.Fn removeFromUtmp
functions have the same properties as the previously mentioned
functions, except that they use an internally cached value of the file
descriptor passed to the login functions.
.Pp
The
.Fa pty
arguments of
.Fn addToUtmp
and
.Fn removeLineFromUtmp
are unused.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
In this implementation, the
.Fn utempter_add_record ,
.Fn utempter_remove_added_record
and
.Fn utempter_remove_record
always return a value of 0.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pututxline 3 ,
.Xr ulog_login_pseudo 3
.Sh HISTORY
These functions appeared in
.Fx 9.0 .
