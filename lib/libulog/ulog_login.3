.Sh NAME
.Nm ulog_login ,
.Nm ulog_login_pseudo ,
.Nm ulog_logout ,
.Nm ulog_logout_pseudo
.Nd manage user login records
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libulog
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ulog.h
.Ft void
.Fn ulog_login "const char *line" "const char *user" "const char *host"
.Ft void
.Fn ulog_login_pseudo "int fd" "const char *host"
.Ft void
.Fn ulog_logout "const char *line"
.Ft void
.Fn ulog_logout_pseudo "int fd"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ulog_login
and
.Fn ulog_login_pseudo
functions register a login session on a TTY.
The
.Fn ulog_login
function adds an entry for TTY
.Fa line
and username
.Fa user .
The
.Fn ulog_login_pseudo
function uses file descriptor to a pseudo-terminal master device
.Fa fd
to determine the TTY name, while using the username belonging to the
real user ID of the calling process.
The optional
.Fa host
argument denotes a remote hostname, in case the login session is
provided by a network service.
.Pp
The
.Fn ulog_logout
and
.Fn ulog_logout_pseudo
functions mark the previously registered login session as being
terminated.
.Pp
Because the
.Fa line
and
.Fa user
arguments of
.Fn ulog_login
and
.Fn ulog_logout
cannot be trusted, these functions require administrative privileges.
The
.Fn ulog_login_pseudo
and
.Fn ulog_logout_pseudo
functions spawn a privileged process to perform the actual logging.
