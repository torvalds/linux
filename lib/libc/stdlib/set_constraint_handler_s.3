.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn set_constraint_handler_s
function sets the runtime-constraint violation handler to be
.Fa handler .
.Pp
The runtime-constraint handler is the callback function invoked when a library
function detects a runtime-constraint violation.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "error"
.It Fa msg
A pointer to a character string describing the runtime-constraint violation.
.It Fa ptr
A
.Dv NULL
pointer.
.It Fa error
If the function calling the handler has a return type declared as
.Vt errno_t ,
the return value of the function is passed.
Otherwise, a positive value of type
.Vt errno_t
is passed.
.El
.Pp
Only the most recent handler registered with
.Fn set_constraint_handler_s
is called when a runtime-constraint violation occurs.
.Pp
The implementation has a default constraint handler that is used if no calls to
the
.Fn set_constraint_handler_s
function have been made.
If the
.Fa handler
argument to
.Fn set_constraint_handler_s
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, the default handler becomes the current constraint handler.
.Pp
The
.Fn abort_handler_s
and
.Fn ignore_handler_s
are the standard-defined runtime-constraint handlers provided by the C library.
.Pp
The
.Fn abort_handler_s
function writes the error message including the
.Fa msg
to
.Dv stderr
and calls the
.Xr abort 3
function.
The
.Fn abort_handler_s
is currently the default runtime-constraint handler.
.Pp
The
.Fn ignore_handler_s
simply returns to its caller.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn set_constraint_handler_s
function returns a pointer to the previously registered handler, or
.Dv NULL
if none was previously registered.
.Pp
The
.Fn abort_handler_s
function does not return to its caller.
.Pp
The
.Fn ignore_handler_s
function returns no value.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn set_constraint_handler_s
function conforms to
.St -isoC-2011
K.3.6.1.1.
