.Sh NAME
.Nm tsearch , tfind , tdelete , twalk
.Nd manipulate binary search trees
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In search.h
.Ft void *
.Fn tdelete "const void * restrict key" "posix_tnode ** restrict rootp" "int (*compar) (const void *, const void *)"
.Ft posix_tnode *
.Fn tfind "const void *key" "posix_tnode * const *rootp" "int (*compar) (const void *, const void *)"
.Ft posix_tnode *
.Fn tsearch "const void *key" "posix_tnode **rootp" "int (*compar) (const void *, const void *)"
.Ft void
.Fn twalk "const posix_tnode *root" "void (*action) (const posix_tnode *, VISIT, int)"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn tdelete ,
.Fn tfind ,
.Fn tsearch ,
and
.Fn twalk
functions manage binary search trees.
This implementation uses a balanced AVL tree,
which due to its strong theoretical limit on the height of the tree has
the advantage of calling the comparison function relatively
infrequently.
.Pp
The comparison function passed in by
the user has the same style of return values as
.Xr strcmp 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn tfind
function
searches for the datum matched by the argument
.Fa key
in the binary tree rooted at
.Fa rootp ,
returning a pointer to the datum if it is found and NULL
if it is not.
.Pp
The
.Fn tsearch
function
is identical to
.Fn tfind
except that if no match is found,
.Fa key
is inserted into the tree and a pointer to it is returned.
If
.Fa rootp
points to a NULL value a new binary search tree is created.
.Pp
The
.Fn tdelete
function
deletes a node from the specified binary search tree and returns
a pointer to the parent of the node to be deleted.
It takes the same arguments as
.Fn tfind
and
.Fn tsearch .
If the node to be deleted is the root of the binary search tree,
.Fa rootp
will be adjusted.
.Pp
The
.Fn twalk
function
walks the binary search tree rooted in
.Fa root
and calls the function
.Fa action
on each node.
The
.Fa action
function
is called with three arguments: a pointer to the current node,
a value from the enum
.Sy "typedef enum { preorder, postorder, endorder, leaf } VISIT;"
specifying the traversal type, and a node level (where level
zero is the root of the tree).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn tsearch
function returns NULL if allocation of a new node fails (usually
due to a lack of free memory).
.Pp
The
.Fn tfind ,
.Fn tsearch ,
and
.Fn tdelete
functions
return NULL if
.Fa rootp
is NULL or the datum cannot be found.
.Pp
The
.Fn twalk
function returns no value.
.Sh EXAMPLES
This example uses
.Fn tsearch
to search for four strings in
.Dv root .
Because the strings are not already present, they are added.
.Fn tsearch
is called twice on the fourth string to demonstrate that a string is not added when it is already present.
.Fn tfind
is used to find the single instance of the fourth string, and
.Fn tdelete
removes it.
Finally,
.Fn twalk
is used to return and display the resulting binary search tree.

.Sh STANDARDS
These functions conform to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Pp
The
.Fa posix_tnode
type is not part of
.St -p1003.1-2008 ,
but is expected to be standardized by future versions of the standard.
It is defined as
.Fa void
for source-level compatibility.
Using
.Fa posix_tnode
makes distinguishing between nodes and keys easier.
