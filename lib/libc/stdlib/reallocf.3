.Sh NAME
.Nm reallocf
.Nd memory reallocation function
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft void *
.Fn reallocf "void *ptr" "size_t size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn reallocf
function is identical to the
.Fn realloc
function, except that it
will free the passed pointer when the requested memory cannot be allocated.
This is a
.Fx
specific API designed to ease the problems with traditional coding styles
for
.Fn realloc
causing memory leaks in libraries.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn reallocf
function returns a pointer, possibly identical to
.Fa ptr ,
to the allocated memory
if successful; otherwise a
.Dv NULL
pointer is returned, and
.Va errno
is set to
.Er ENOMEM
if the error was the result of an allocation failure.
The
.Fn reallocf
function deletes the original buffer when an error occurs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr realloc 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn reallocf
function first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
