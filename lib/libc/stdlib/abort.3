is being caught and the signal handler does not return.
.Pp
Some implementations may flush output streams before terminating.
This implementation does not.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn abort
function first appeared in
.At v5 .

to flush and close output streams, but this conflicted with the requirement
that
.Fn abort
be async signal safe.
As a result, the flushing requirement was dropped.
