.Dt ATOL 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm atol , atoll
.Nd convert
.Tn ASCII
string to
.Vt long
or
.Vt "long long"
integer
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft long
.Fn atol "const char *nptr"
.Ft "long long"
.Fn atoll "const char *nptr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn atol
function converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by
.Fa nptr
to
.Vt long
integer
representation.
.Pp
It is equivalent to:
.Pp
.Dl "strtol(nptr, (char **)NULL, 10);"
.Pp
The
.Fn atoll
function converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by
.Fa nptr
to
.Vt "long long"
integer
representation.
.Pp
It is equivalent to:
.Pp
.Dl "strtoll(nptr, (char **)NULL, 10);"
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Fx
implementations of the
.Fn atol
and
.Fn atoll
functions are thin wrappers around
.Fn strtol
and
.Fn strtoll
respectively, so these functions will affect the value of
.Va errno
in the same way that the
.Fn strtol
and
.Fn strtoll
functions are able to.
This behavior of
.Fn atol
and
.Fn atoll
is not required by
.St -isoC
or
.St -isoC-99 ,
but it is allowed by all of
.St -isoC , St -isoC-99
and
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
.Sh ERRORS
The functions
.Fn atol
and
.Fn atoll
may affect the value of
.Va errno
on an error.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr atof 3 ,
.Xr atoi 3 ,
.Xr strtod 3 ,
.Xr strtol 3 ,
.Xr strtoul 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn atol
function
conforms to
.St -isoC .
The
.Fn atoll
function
conforms to
.St -isoC-99 .
