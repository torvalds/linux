.Sh NAME
.Nm atoi
.Nd convert ASCII string to integer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft int
.Fn atoi "const char *nptr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn atoi
function converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by
.Fa nptr
to
.Vt integer
representation.
.Pp
It is equivalent to:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
(int)strtol(nptr, (char **)NULL, 10);

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr atof 3 ,
.Xr atol 3 ,
.Xr strtod 3 ,
.Xr strtol 3 ,
.Xr strtonum 3 ,
.Xr strtoul 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn atoi
function conforms to
.St -ansiC .
.Sh HISTORY
An
.Fn atoi
function first appeared in
.At v1 .
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
does no overflow checking, handles unsigned numbers poorly,
and handles strings containing trailing extra characters
(like
.Dq "123abc" )
poorly.
Careful use of
.Xr strtol 3
and
.Xr strtoul 3
can alleviate these problems,
but
.Xr strtonum 3
can be used to convert numbers from strings much more safely
and easily.
