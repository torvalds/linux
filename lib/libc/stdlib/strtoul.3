.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strtoul
function
converts the string in
.Fa nptr
to an
.Vt "unsigned long"
value.
The
.Fn strtoull
function
converts the string in
.Fa nptr
to an
.Vt "unsigned long long"
value.
The
.Fn strtoumax
function
converts the string in
.Fa nptr
to an
.Vt uintmax_t
value.
The
.Fn strtouq
function
converts the string in
.Fa nptr
to a
.Vt u_quad_t
value.
The conversion is done according to the given
.Fa base ,
which must be between 2 and 36 inclusive,
or be the special value 0.
.Pp
The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of white space
(as determined by
.Xr isspace 3 )
followed by a single optional
.Ql +
or
.Ql -
sign.
If
.Fa base
is zero or 16,
the string may then include a
.Dq Li 0x
prefix,
and the number will be read in base 16; otherwise, a zero
.Fa base
is taken as 10 (decimal) unless the next character is
.Ql 0 ,
in which case it is taken as 8 (octal).
.Pp
The remainder of the string is converted to an
.Vt "unsigned long"
value in the obvious manner,
stopping at the end of the string
or at the first character that does not produce a valid digit
in the given base.
(In bases above 10, the letter
.Ql A
in either upper or lower case
represents 10,
.Ql B
represents 11, and so forth, with
.Ql Z
representing 35.)
.Pp
If
.Fa endptr
is not
.Dv NULL ,
.Fn strtoul
stores the address of the first invalid character in
.Fa *endptr .
If there were no digits at all, however,
.Fn strtoul
stores the original value of
.Fa nptr
in
.Fa *endptr .
(Thus, if
.Fa *nptr
is not
.Ql \e0
but
.Fa **endptr
is
.Ql \e0
on return, the entire string was valid.)
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn strtoul ,
.Fn strtoull ,
.Fn strtoumax
and
.Fn strtouq
functions
return either the result of the conversion
or, if there was a leading minus sign,
the negation of the result of the conversion,
unless the original (non-negated) value would overflow;
in the latter case,
.Fn strtoul
returns
.Dv ULONG_MAX ,
.Fn strtoull
returns
.Dv ULLONG_MAX ,
.Fn strtoumax
returns
.Dv UINTMAX_MAX ,
and
.Fn strtouq
returns
.Dv ULLONG_MAX .
In all cases,
.Va errno
is set to
.Er ERANGE .
If no conversion could be performed, 0 is returned and
the global variable
.Va errno
is set to
.Er EINVAL
(the last feature is not portable across all platforms).
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value of
.Fa base
is not supported or
no conversion could be performed
(the last feature is not portable across all platforms).
.It Bq Er ERANGE
The given string was out of range; the value converted has been clamped.
