.Dt STRFMON 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm strfmon
.Nd convert monetary value to string
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In monetary.h
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn strfmon "char * restrict s" "size_t maxsize" "const char * restrict format" "..."
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn strfmon_l "char * restrict s" "size_t maxsize" "locale_t loc" "const char * restrict format" "..."
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strfmon
function places characters into the array pointed to by
.Fa s
as controlled by the string pointed to by
.Fa format .
No more than
.Fa maxsize
bytes are placed into the array.
.Pp
The
.Fn strfmon_l
function does the same as
.Fn strfmon
but takes an explicit locale rather than using the current locale.
.Pp
The format string is composed of zero or more directives:
ordinary characters (not
.Cm % ) ,
which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion
specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent
arguments.
Each conversion specification is introduced by the
.Cm %
character.
After the
.Cm % ,
the following appear in sequence:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Zero or more of the following flags:
.Bl -tag -width "XXX"
.It Cm = Ns Ar f
A
.Sq Cm =
character followed by another character
.Ar f
which is used as the numeric fill character.
.It Cm ^
Do not use grouping characters, regardless of the current locale default.
.It Cm +
Represent positive values by prefixing them with a positive sign,
and negative values by prefixing them with a negative sign.
This is the default.
.It Cm \&(
Enclose negative values in parentheses.
.It Cm \&!
Do not include a currency symbol in the output.
.It Cm \-
Left justify the result.
Only valid when a field width is specified.
.El
.It
An optional minimum field width as a decimal number.
By default, there is no minimum width.
.It
A
.Sq Cm #
sign followed by a decimal number specifying the maximum
expected number of digits after the radix character.
.It
A
.Sq Cm \&.
character followed by a decimal number specifying the number
the number of digits after the radix character.
.It
One of the following conversion specifiers:
.Bl -tag -width "XXX"
.It Cm i
The
.Vt double
argument is formatted as an international monetary amount.
.It Cm n
The
.Vt double
argument is formatted as a national monetary amount.
.It Cm %
A
.Sq Li %
character is written.
.El
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the total number of resulting bytes including the terminating
.Dv NUL
byte is not more than
.Fa maxsize ,
.Fn strfmon
returns the number of bytes placed into the array pointed to by
.Fa s ,
not including the terminating
.Dv NUL
byte.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned,
the contents of the array are indeterminate,
and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Pp
The
.Fn strfmon_l
function returns the same values as
.Fn strfmon .
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn strfmon
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er E2BIG
Conversion stopped due to lack of space in the buffer.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The format string is invalid.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Not enough memory for temporary buffers.

.Fn strfmon
function
conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
The
.Fn strfmon_l
function conforms to

.Fn strfmon
function was implemented by

.An Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven Aq Mt asmodai@FreeBSD.org
based on the standards' text.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fn strfmon
function does not correctly handle multibyte characters in the
.Fa format
argument.
