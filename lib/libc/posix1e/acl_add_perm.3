.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_add_perm
.Nd add permissions to a permission set
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft int
.Fn acl_add_perm "acl_permset_t permset_d" "acl_perm_t perm"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_add_perm
function
is a POSIX.1e call that adds the permission contained in
.Fa perm
to the permission set
.Fa permset_d .
.Pp
Note: it is not considered an error to attempt to add permissions
that already exist in the permission set.
.Pp
For POSIX.1e ACLs, valid values are:
.Bl -column -offset 3n "ACL_WRITE_NAMED_ATTRS"
.It ACL_EXECUTE	Execute permission
.It ACL_WRITE	Write permission
.It ACL_READ	Read permission
.El
.Pp
For NFSv4 ACLs, valid values are:
.Bl -column -offset 3n "ACL_WRITE_NAMED_ATTRS"
.It ACL_READ_DATA Ta "Read permission"
.It ACL_LIST_DIRECTORY Ta "Same as ACL_READ_DATA"
.It ACL_WRITE_DATA Ta "Write permission, or permission to create files"
.It ACL_ADD_FILE Ta "Same as ACL_READ_DATA"
.It ACL_APPEND_DATA Ta "Permission to create directories.  Ignored for files"
.It ACL_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY Ta "Same as ACL_APPEND_DATA"
.It ACL_READ_NAMED_ATTRS Ta "Ignored"
.It ACL_WRITE_NAMED_ATTRS Ta "Ignored"
.It ACL_EXECUTE Ta "Execute permission"
.It ACL_DELETE_CHILD Ta "Permission to delete files and subdirectories"
.It ACL_READ_ATTRIBUTES Ta "Permission to read basic attributes"
.It ACL_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES Ta "Permission to change basic attributes"
.It ACL_DELETE Ta "Permission to delete the object this ACL is placed on"
.It ACL_READ_ACL Ta "Permission to read ACL"
.It ACL_WRITE_ACL Ta "Permission to change the ACL and file mode"
.It ACL_SYNCHRONIZE Ta "Ignored"
.El
.Pp
Calling
.Fn acl_add_perm
with
.Fa perm
equal to ACL_WRITE or ACL_READ brands the ACL as POSIX.
Calling it with ACL_READ_DATA, ACL_LIST_DIRECTORY, ACL_WRITE_DATA,
ACL_ADD_FILE, ACL_APPEND_DATA, ACL_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY, ACL_READ_NAMED_ATTRS,
ACL_WRITE_NAMED_ATTRS, ACL_DELETE_CHILD, ACL_READ_ATTRIBUTES,
ACL_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_DELETE, ACL_READ_ACL, ACL_WRITE_ACL
or ACL_SYNCHRONIZE brands the ACL as NFSv4.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std acl_add_perm
.Sh ERRORS

.Fn acl_add_perm
function fails if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Argument
