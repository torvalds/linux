.Sh NAME
.Nm mac_prepare , mac_prepare_type , mac_prepare_file_label ,
.Nm mac_prepare_ifnet_label , mac_prepare_process_label
.Nd allocate appropriate storage for
.Vt mac_t
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/mac.h
.Ft int
.Fn mac_prepare "mac_t *mac" "const char *elements"
.Ft int
.Fn mac_prepare_type "mac_t *mac" "const char *name"
.Ft int
.Fn mac_prepare_file_label "mac_t *mac"
.Ft int
.Fn mac_prepare_ifnet_label "mac_t *mac"
.Ft int
.Fn mac_prepare_process_label "mac_t *mac"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
family of functions allocates the appropriate amount of storage and initializes
.Fa *mac
for use by
.Xr mac_get 3 .
When the resulting label is passed into the
.Xr mac_get 3
functions, the kernel will attempt to fill in the label elements specified
when the label was prepared.
Elements are specified in a nul-terminated string, using commas to
delimit fields.
Element names may be prefixed with the
.Ql \&?
character to indicate that a failure by the kernel to retrieve that
element should not be considered fatal.
.Pp
The
.Fn mac_prepare
function accepts a list of policy names as a parameter, and allocates the
storage to fit those label elements accordingly.
The remaining functions in the family make use of system defaults defined
in
.Xr mac.conf 5
instead of an explicit
.Va elements
argument, deriving the default from the specified object type.
.Pp
.Fn mac_prepare_type
allocates the storage to fit an object label of the type specified by
the
.Va name
argument.
The
.Fn mac_prepare_file_label ,
.Fn mac_prepare_ifnet_label ,
and
.Fn mac_prepare_process_label
functions are equivalent to invocations of
.Fn mac_prepare_type
with arguments of
.Qq file ,
.Qq ifnet ,
and
.Qq process
respectively.

.Sh STANDARDS
POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.
Discussion of the draft
continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation mailing list.
To join this list, see the
.Fx
POSIX.1e implementation page
for more information.
.Sh HISTORY
Support for Mandatory Access Control was introduced in
.Fx 5.0
as part of the
.Tn TrustedBSD
Project.
Support for generic object types first appeared in
.Fx 5.2 .
