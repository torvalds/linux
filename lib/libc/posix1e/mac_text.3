.Dt MAC_TEXT 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mac_from_text ,
.Nm mac_to_text
.Nd convert MAC label to/from text representation
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/mac.h
.Ft int
.Fn mac_from_text "mac_t *mac" "const char *text"
.Ft int
.Fn mac_to_text "mac_t label" "char **text"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mac_from_text
function converts the text representation of a label
into the internal policy label format
.Pq Vt mac_t
and places it in
.Fa *mac ,
which must later be freed with
.Xr free 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn mac_to_text
function allocates storage for
.Fa *text ,
which will be set to the text representation of
.Fa label .
.Pp
Refer to
.Xr maclabel 7
for the MAC label format.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std mac_from_text mac_to_text
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
POSIX.1e does not define
a format for text representations
of MAC labels.
.Pp
POSIX.1e requires that text strings allocated using
.Fn mac_to_text
be freed using
.Xr mac_free 3 ;
in the
.Fx
implementation, they must be freed using
.Xr free 3 ,
as
.Xr mac_free 3
is used only to free memory used for type
.Vt mac_t .
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Insufficient memory was available
to allocate internal storage.

.Sh STANDARDS
POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.
Discussion of the draft
continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation mailing list.
To join this list, see the
.Fx
POSIX.1e implementation page
for more information.
.Sh HISTORY
Support for Mandatory Access Control was introduced in
.Fx 5.0
as part of the
.Tn TrustedBSD
Project.
