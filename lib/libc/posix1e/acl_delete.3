.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_delete_def_file ,
.Nm acl_delete_def_link_np ,
.Nm acl_delete_fd_np ,
.Nm acl_delete_file_np ,
.Nm acl_delete_link_np
.Nd delete an ACL from a file
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft int
.Fn acl_delete_def_file "const char *path_p"
.Ft int
.Fn acl_delete_def_link_np "const char *path_p"
.Ft int
.Fn acl_delete_fd_np "int filedes" "acl_type_t type"
.Ft int
.Fn acl_delete_file_np "const char *path_p" "acl_type_t type"
.Ft int
.Fn acl_delete_link_np "const char *path_p" "acl_type_t type"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_delete_def_file ,
.Fn acl_delete_def_link_np ,
.Fn acl_delete_fd_np ,
.Fn acl_delete_file_np ,
and
.Fn acl_delete_link_np
each allow the deletion of an ACL from a file.
The
.Fn acl_delete_def_file
function
is a POSIX.1e call that deletes the default ACL from a file (normally a
directory) by name; the remainder of the calls are non-portable extensions
that permit the deletion of arbitrary ACL types from a file/directory
either by path name or file descriptor.
The
.Fn _file
variations follow a symlink if it occurs in the last segment of the
path name; the
.Fn _link
variations operate on the symlink itself.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Fx Ns 's
support for POSIX.1e interfaces and features is still under
development at this time.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, these functions shall return -1
and set
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix, or the
object exists and the process does not have appropriate access rights.
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Va fd
argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The ACL type passed is invalid for this file object.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named object does not exist, or the
.Va path_p
argument points to an empty string.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Insufficient memory available to fulfill request.
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.Pp
Argument
.Va path_p
must be a directory, and is not.
.It Bq Er EOPNOTSUPP
The file system does not support ACL deletion.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The process does not have appropriate privilege to perform the operation
to delete an ACL.
.It Bq Er EROFS
The file system is read-only.

POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.
Discussion
of the draft continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation
mailing list.

.Fx 4.0 ,
and development continues.
