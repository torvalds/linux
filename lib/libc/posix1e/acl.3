.Dt ACL 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm acl
.Nd introduction to the POSIX.1e/NFSv4 ACL security API
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fx
permits file systems to export Access Control Lists via the VFS, and
provides a library for userland access to and manipulation of these ACLs.
.Fx
supports POSIX.1e and NFSv4 ACLs, but
not all file systems provide support for ACLs, and some may require that
ACL support be explicitly enabled by the administrator.
The library calls include routines to allocate, duplicate, retrieve, set,
and validate ACLs associated with file objects.
As well as the POSIX.1e routines, there are a number of non-portable
extensions defined that allow for ACL semantics alternative to
POSIX.1e, such as NFSv4.
Where routines are non-standard, they are suffixed with _np to indicate that
they are not portable.
.Pp
POSIX.1e describes a set of ACL manipulation routines to manage the
contents of ACLs, as well as their relationships with files; almost
all of these support routines are implemented in
.Fx .

Documentation of the internal kernel interfaces backing these calls may
be found in
.Xr acl 9 .
The syscalls between the internal interfaces and the public library
routines may change over time, and as such are not documented.
They are not intended to be called directly without going through the
library.

.Sh STANDARDS
POSIX.1e assigns security labels to all objects, extending the security
functionality described in POSIX.1.
These additional labels provide fine-grained discretionary access control,
fine-grained capabilities, and labels necessary for mandatory access
control.
POSIX.2c describes a set of userland utilities for manipulating these
labels.
.Pp
POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.
Discussion of the draft continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e
implementation mailing list.
To join this list, see the
.Fx
POSIX.1e implementation page for more information.
.Sh HISTORY
POSIX.1e support was introduced in
.Fx 4.0 ;
.Fx 5.0
was the first version to include a complete ACL implementation based
on extended attributes for the UFS and UFS2 file systems.
NFSv4 ACL support was introduced in
.Fx 8.0 .
.Pp
The
.Xr getfacl 1
and
.Xr setfacl 1
utilities describe the user tools that permit direct manipulation of complete
file ACLs.
