.Dt ACL_STRIP_NP 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_strip_np
.Nd strip extended entries from an ACL
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft acl_t
.Fn acl_strip_np "const acl_t acl" "int recalculate_mask"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_strip_np
function returns a pointer to a trivial ACL computed from the ACL pointed
to by the argument
.Va acl .
.Pp
This function may cause memory to be allocated.
The caller should free any
releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling
.Xr acl_free 3
with the
.Va (void*)acl_t
as an argument.
.Pp
Any existing ACL pointers that refer to the ACL referred to by
.Va acl
shall continue to refer to the ACL.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, this function shall return a pointer to the
newly allocated ACL.
Otherwise, a value of
.Va (acl_t)NULL
shall be returned, and
.Va errno
shall be set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_init
function shall return a value of
.Va (acl_t)NULL
and set
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Argument
.Va acl
does not point to a valid ACL.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The
.Va acl_t
to be returned requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or
system-imposed memory management constraints.

of the draft continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation
mailing list.
