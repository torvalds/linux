.Sh NAME
.Nm mac_set_file ,
.Nm mac_set_fd ,
.Nm mac_set_proc
.Nd set the MAC label for a file or process
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/mac.h
.Ft int
.Fn mac_set_file "const char *path" "mac_t label"
.Ft int
.Fn mac_set_link "const char *path" "mac_t label"
.Ft int
.Fn mac_set_fd "int fd" "mac_t label"
.Ft int
.Fn mac_set_proc "mac_t label"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mac_set_file
and
.Fn mac_set_fd
functions associate a MAC label
specified by
.Fa label
to the file referenced to by
.Fa path_p ,
or to the file descriptor
.Fa fd ,
respectively.
Note that when a file descriptor references a socket, label operations
on the file descriptor act on the socket, not on the file that may
have been used as a rendezvous when binding the socket.
The
.Fn mac_set_link
function is the same as
.Fn mac_set_file ,
except that it does not follow symlinks.
.Pp
The
.Fn mac_set_proc
function associates the MAC label
specified by
.Fa label
to the calling process.
.Pp
A process is allowed to set a label for a file
only if it has MAC write access to the file,
and its effective user ID is equal to
the owner of the file,
or has appropriate privileges.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std mac_set_fd mac_set_file mac_set_link mac_set_proc
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
MAC write access to the file is denied.
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa fd
argument
is not a valid file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa label
argument
is not a valid MAC label, or the object referenced by
.Fa fd
is not appropriate for label operations.
.It Bq Er EOPNOTSUPP
Setting MAC labels is not supported
by the file referenced by
.Fa fd .
.It Bq Er EPERM
The calling process had insufficient privilege
to change the MAC label.
.It Bq Er EROFS
File system for the object being modified
is read only.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
.\" XXX POSIX_NO_TRUNC?
The length of the pathname in
.Fa path_p
exceeds
.Dv PATH_MAX ,
or a component of the pathname
is longer than
.Dv NAME_MAX .
.It Bq Er ENOENT

.Fa path_p
does not exist.
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the pathname
referenced by
.Fa path_p
is not a directory.
