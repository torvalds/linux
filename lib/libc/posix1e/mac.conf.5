.Dt MAC.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mac.conf
.Nd format of the MAC library configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file configures the default label elements to be used by policy-agnostic
applications that operate on MAC labels.
A file contains a series of default label sets specified by object class,
in addition to blank lines and comments preceded by a
.Ql #
symbol.
.Pp
Currently, the implementation supports two syntax styles for label
element declaration.
The old (deprecated) syntax consists of a
single line with two fields separated by white space: the object
class name, and a list of label elements as used by the
.Xr mac_prepare 3
library calls prior to an application invocation of a function from
.Xr mac_get 3 .
.Pp
The newer more preferred syntax consists of three fields separated by
white space: the label group, object class name and a list of
label elements.
.Pp
Label element names may optionally begin with a
.Ql \&?
symbol to indicate that a failure to retrieve the label element for
an object should be silently ignored, and improves usability if the
set of MAC policies may change over time.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/mac.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/mac.conf
MAC library configuration file.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example configures user applications to operate with
four MAC policies:
.Xr mac_biba 4 ,
.Xr mac_mls 4 ,
SEBSD,
and
.Xr mac_partition 4 .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#
# Default label set to be used by simple MAC applications

default_labels file ?biba,?lomac,?mls,?sebsd
default_labels ifnet ?biba,?lomac,?mls,?sebsd
default_labels process ?biba,?lomac,?mls,?partition,?sebsd
default_labels socket ?biba,?lomac,?mls

#
# Deprecated (old) syntax

default_file_labels ?biba,?mls,?sebsd
default_ifnet_labels ?biba,?mls,?sebsd
default_process_labels ?biba,?mls,partition,?sebsd
.Ed
.Pp
In this example, userland applications will attempt to retrieve Biba,
MLS, and SEBSD labels for all object classes; for processes, they will
additionally attempt to retrieve a Partition identifier.
In all cases except the Partition identifier, failure to retrieve a
label due to the respective policy not being present will be ignored.

.Sh HISTORY
Support for Mandatory Access Control was introduced in

as part of the
.Tn TrustedBSD
Project.
