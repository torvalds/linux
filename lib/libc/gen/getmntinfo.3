.Sh NAME
.Nm getmntinfo
.Nd get information about mounted file systems
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/ucred.h
.In sys/mount.h
.Ft int
.Fn getmntinfo "struct statfs **mntbufp" "int mode"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getmntinfo
function
returns an array of
.Fn statfs
structures describing each currently mounted file system (see
.Xr statfs 2 ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn getmntinfo
function
passes its
.Fa mode
argument transparently to
.Xr getfsstat 2 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On successful completion,
.Fn getmntinfo
returns a count of the number of elements in the array.
The pointer to the array is stored into
.Fa mntbufp .
.Pp
If an error occurs, zero is returned and the external variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
Although the pointer
.Fa mntbufp
will be unmodified, any information previously returned by
.Fn getmntinfo
will be lost.

The
.Fn getmntinfo
function
may fail and set errno for any of the errors specified for the library
routines
.Xr getfsstat 2
or
.Xr malloc 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getfsstat 2 ,
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr statfs 2 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getmntinfo
function first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fn getmntinfo
function writes the array of structures to an internal static object
and returns
a pointer to that object.
Subsequent calls to
.Fn getmntinfo
will modify the same object.
.Pp
The memory allocated by
.Fn getmntinfo
cannot be
.Xr free 3 Ns 'd
by the application.
