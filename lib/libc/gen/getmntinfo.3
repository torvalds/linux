.In sys/types.h
.In sys/mount.h
.Ft int
.Fn getmntinfo "struct statfs **mntbufp" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getmntinfo
function returns an array of
.Vt statfs
structures describing each currently mounted file system (see
.Xr statfs 2 ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn getmntinfo
function passes its
.Fa flags
parameter transparently to
.Xr getfsstat 2 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES

returns a count of the number of elements in the array.
The pointer to the array is stored into
.Fa mntbufp .
.Pp
If an error occurs, zero is returned and the external variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.

.Xr mount 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getmntinfo
function first appeared in
.Bx 4.3 Reno .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fn getmntinfo
function writes the array of structures to an internal static object

will modify the same object.
.Pp
The memory allocated by
.Fn getmntinfo
cannot be
.Xr free 3 Ns 'd
