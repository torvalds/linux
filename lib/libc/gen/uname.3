.Sh NAME
.Nm uname
.Nd get system identification
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/utsname.h
.Ft int
.Fn uname "struct utsname *name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn uname
function stores NUL-terminated strings of information identifying
the current system into the structure referenced by
.Fa name .
.Pp
The
.Vt utsname
structure is defined in the
.In sys/utsname.h
header file, and contains the following members:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width nodenameXXXX -offset indent -compact
.It Fa sysname
Name of the operating system implementation.
.It Fa nodename
Network name of this machine.
.It Fa release
Release level of the operating system.
.It Fa version
Version level of the operating system.
.It Fa machine
Machine hardware platform.
.El
.Pp
These are the same strings that can be displayed with
.Xr uname 1 .
Because their format and meaning depends on the operating system,
trying to parse or interpret them is discouraged in portable code.
The only reasonable way an application program can use them
is for displaying them to the user.

.Fn uname
function returns a non-negative value if successful;
otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS

.Fn uname
function may fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library function
.Xr sysctl 2 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr uname 1 ,
.Xr sysctl 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn uname
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-88 .

.Fn uname
function first appeared in PWB/UNIX 1.0
