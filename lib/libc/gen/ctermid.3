function generates a string that, when used as a pathname, refers to
the current controlling terminal of the calling process.

is assumed to point to an array at least
.Dv L_ctermid
(as defined in the include
file
.In stdio.h )
bytes long.
.Pp
The current implementation simply generates
.Qq /dev/tty .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn ctermid
function returns a non-null pointer, which is equal to the
.Ar buf
argument if it is not
.Dv NULL .
.Sh ERRORS
The current implementation detects no error conditions.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ttyname 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn ctermid
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-88 .
