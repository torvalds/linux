.Dt BASENAME 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm basename
.Nd extract the base portion of a pathname
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libgen.h
.Ft char *
.Fn basename "char *path"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn basename
function returns the last component from the pathname pointed to by
.Fa path ,
deleting any trailing
.Sq \&/
characters.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
This implementation of
.Fn basename
uses the buffer provided by the caller to store the resulting pathname
component.
Other vendor implementations may return a pointer to internal storage
space instead.
The advantage of the former approach is that it ensures thread-safety,
while also placing no upper limit on the supported length of the
pathname.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If
.Fa path
consists entirely of
.Sq \&/
characters, a pointer to the string
.Qq \&/
is returned.
If
.Fa path
is a null pointer or the empty string, a pointer to the string
.Qq \&.
is returned.
Otherwise,
it returns a pointer to the last component of
.Fa path .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr basename 1 ,
.Xr dirname 1 ,
.Xr dirname 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn basename
function conforms to
.St -xpg4.2 .
.Sh HISTORY

.Fn basename
function first appeared in
.Ox 2.2
and
.Fx 4.2 .
