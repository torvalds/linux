.In spawn.h
.Ft int

.Sh DESCRIPTION
File actions objects can be initialized by
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_init
and destroyed by
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy .
.Pp
Multiple initialization of the same object is undefined behavior
and will lead to memory leaks.
.Pp
Similarly, objects should be passed to
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy
to reclaim memory.
The object should not be re-used after destruction.
It can however be initialized again with
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_init .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These function return 0 on successful completion.
They may return
.Er ENOMEM
when running out of memory.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr posix_spawn 3 ,
.Xr posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen 3
