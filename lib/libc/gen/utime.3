.Dt UTIME 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm utime
.Nd set file times
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In utime.h
.Ft int
.Fn utime "const char *file" "const struct utimbuf *timep"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This interface is obsoleted by
.Xr utimes 2 .
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn utime
function sets the access and modification times of the named file.
.Pp
If
.Fa timep
is
.Dv NULL ,
the access and modification times are set to the current time.
The calling process must be the owner of the file or have permission to
write the file.
.Pp
If
.Fa timep
is non-null, it specifies a pointer to a
.Vt utimbuf
structure, as defined in
.In utime.h :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct utimbuf {
	time_t actime;		/* Access time */
	time_t modtime;		/* Modification time */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The access time is set to the value of the
.Fa actime
member, and the modification
time is set to the value of the
.Fa modtime
member.
The times are measured in
seconds since 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, January 1, 1970, Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC).
The calling process must be the owner of the file or be the superuser.
.Pp
In either case, the inode change-time of the file is set to the current
time.

match the owner of the file, the effective user ID is not that of the
superuser,
and write access is denied.
.It Bq Er EFAULT

or
.Fa timep
points outside the process's allocated address space.

.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The
.Fa timep
argument is not

and the calling process's effective user ID
does not match the owner of the file and is not the superuser.
.It Bq Er EROFS
