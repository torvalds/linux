.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm toupper ,
.Nm toupper_l ,
.Nm _toupper
.Nd lower case to upper case letter conversion
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn toupper "int c"
.Ft int
.Fn toupper_l "int c" "locale_t locale"
.Ft int
.Fn _toupper "int c"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn toupper
and
.Fn toupper_l
functions convert a lower-case letter to the corresponding
upper-case letter.
The
.Fn _toupper
function is identical to
.Fn toupper
except that
.Fa c
must be a lower-case letter.
.Pp
.Ox
always uses the C locale for these functions,
ignoring the global locale, the thread-specific locale, and the
.Fa locale
argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the argument to the
.Fn toupper
or
.Fn toupper_l
function is a lower-case letter, the corresponding upper-case letter
is returned if there is one; otherwise the argument is returned unchanged.
If the argument to the
.Fn _toupper
function is a lower-case letter, the corresponding upper-case letter
is returned; otherwise the output is undefined.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
On systems supporting non-ASCII single-byte character encodings,
the results of
.Fn toupper
and
.Fn _toupper
may depend on the
.Ev LC_CTYPE
.Xr locale 1 .

function conforms to

to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn toupper
function first appeared in
.At v7
and acquired the current semantics in
.At III ,
where

first appeared.

The
.Fn toupper_l
function has been available since

.Fa c
must be
.Dv EOF
or representable as an
.Vt unsigned char ;
otherwise, the result is undefined.
