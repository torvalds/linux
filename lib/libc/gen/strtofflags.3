.Sh NAME
.Nm fflagstostr ,
.Nm strtofflags
.Nd convert between file flag bits and their string names
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft char *
.Fn fflagstostr "u_long flags"
.Ft int
.Fn strtofflags "char **stringp" "u_long *setp" "u_long *clrp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fflagstostr
function returns a comma separated string of the file flags represented by
.Fa flags .
If no flags are set a zero length string is returned.
.Pp
If memory cannot be allocated for the return value,
.Fn fflagstostr
returns
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
The value returned from
.Fn fflagstostr
is obtained from
.Fn malloc
and should be returned to the system with
.Fn free
when the program is done with it.
.Pp
The
.Fn strtofflags
function takes a string of file flags, as described in
.Xr chflags 1 ,
parses it, and returns the 'set' flags and 'clear' flags
such as would be given as arguments to
.Xr chflags 2 .
On success
.Fn strtofflags
returns 0, otherwise it returns non-zero and
.Fa stringp
is left pointing to the offending token.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn fflagstostr
function
may fail and set errno for any of the errors specified for the library
routine
.Xr malloc 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chflags 1 ,
.Xr chflags 2 ,
.Xr malloc 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn fflagstostr
and
.Fn strtofflags
functions first appeared in
.Fx 4.0 .
