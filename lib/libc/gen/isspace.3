.Dt ISSPACE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm isspace ,
.Nm isspace_l
.Nd whitespace single-byte character test
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn isspace "int c"
.Ft int
.Fn isspace_l "int c" "locale_t locale"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isspace
and
.Fn isspace_l
functions test for whitespace characters.
.Pp
In the C locale, the complete list of whitespace characters is:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxx -offset indent -compact
.It Sq \0
Space character.
.It Li \ef
Form feed.
.It Li \en
New-line.
.It Li \er
Carriage return.
.It Li \et
Horizontal tab.
.It Li \ev
And vertical tab.
.El
.Pp
.Ox
always uses the C locale for these functions,
ignoring the global locale, the thread-specific locale, and the
.Fa locale
argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return zero if the character tests false or
non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
On systems supporting non-ASCII single-byte character encodings,
these functions may return non-zero for additional characters,
and the results of
.Fn isspace
may depend on the
.Ev LC_CTYPE
.Xr locale 1 .

.Sh STANDARDS

.Fn isspace
function conforms to
.St -ansiC ,
and
.Fn isspace_l
to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn isspace
function first appeared in
.At v7 ,
and
.Fn isspace_l
has been available since
.Ox 6.2 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The argument
.Fa c
must be
.Dv EOF
or representable as an
.Vt unsigned char ;
otherwise, the result is undefined.
