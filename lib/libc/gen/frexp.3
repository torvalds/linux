.Dt FREXP 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm frexp ,
.Nm frexpf ,
.Nm frexpl
.Nd convert floating-point number to fractional and integral components
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libm
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn frexp "double value" "int *exp"
.Ft float
.Fn frexpf "float value" "int *exp"
.Ft long double
.Fn frexpl "long double value" "int *exp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn frexp
function breaks a floating-point number into a normalized
fraction and an integral power of 2.
It stores the integer in the
.Vt int
object pointed to by
.Fa exp .
The
.Fn frexpf
function is a single precision version of
.Fn frexp .
The
.Fn frexpl
function is an extended precision version of
.Fn frexp .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn frexp ,
.Fn frexpf
and
.Fn frexpl
functions return the value
.Li x ,
such that
.Li x
is a
.Vt double
with magnitude in the interval [1/2,\ 1) or zero, and
.Fa value
equals
.Li x
times 2 raised to the power
.Fa *exp .
If
.Fa value
is zero, both parts of the result are zero.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ldexp 3 ,
.Xr modf 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn frexp
function conforms to
.St -ansiC .
