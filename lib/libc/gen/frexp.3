.Sh NAME
.Nm frexp ,
.Nm frexpf ,
.Nm frexpl
.Nd convert floating-point number to fractional and integral components
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn frexp "double value" "int *exp"
.Ft float
.Fn frexpf "float value" "int *exp"
.Ft long double
.Fn frexpl "long double value" "int *exp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn frexp ,
.Fn frexpf
and
.Fn frexpl
functions break a floating-point number into a normalized
fraction and an integral power of 2.
They store the integer in the
.Vt int
object pointed to by
.Fa exp .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return the value
.Va x ,
such that
.Va x
is a
.Vt double
with magnitude in the interval
.Eo [ 1/2 , 1 Ec )
or zero, and
.Fa value
equals
.Va x
times 2 raised to the power
.Fa *exp .
If
.Fa value
is zero, both parts of the result are zero.

.Xr modf 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn frexp ,
.Fn frexpf ,
and
.Fn frexpl
functions conform to
.St -isoC-99 .
