.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm isxdigit ,
.Nm isxdigit_l
.Nd hexadecimal-digit single-byte character test
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn isxdigit "int c"
.Ft int
.Fn isxdigit_l "int c" "locale_t locale"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isxdigit
and
.Fn isxdigit_l
functions test for any hexadecimal-digit character.
.Pp
In the C locale, the complete list of hexadecimal digits
is 0, 1\(en9, A\(enF, and a\(enf.
.Ox
always uses the C locale for these functions,
ignoring the global locale, the thread-specific locale, and the
.Fa locale
argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return zero if the character tests false or
non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
On systems supporting non-ASCII single-byte character encodings,
these functions may return non-zero for additional characters,
and the results of
.Fn isxdigit
may depend on the
.Ev LC_CTYPE
.Xr locale 1 .

.Xr isalpha 3 ,
.Xr isascii 3 ,

.Xr isupper 3 ,
.Xr iswxdigit 3 ,
.Xr stdio 3 ,
.Xr toascii 3 ,
.Xr tolower 3 ,
.Xr toupper 3 ,
.Xr ascii 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn isxdigit
function conforms to
.St -ansiC ,
and
.Fn isxdigit_l
to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn isxdigit
function first appeared in
.At v7 ,
and
.Fn isdigit_l
has been available since
.Ox 6.2 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The argument
.Fa c
must be
.Dv EOF
or representable as an
.Vt unsigned char ;
otherwise, the result is undefined.
