.Sh NAME
.Nm posix_spawnattr_init ,
.Nm posix_spawnattr_destroy
.Nd "initialize and destroy spawn attributes object"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In spawn.h
.Ft int
.Fn posix_spawnattr_init "posix_spawnattr_t * attr"
.Ft int
.Fn posix_spawnattr_destroy "posix_spawnattr_t * attr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn posix_spawnattr_init
function initializes a spawn attributes object
.Fa attr
with the default value for all of the individual attributes used by the
implementation.
Initializing an already initialized spawn attributes object may cause
memory to be leaked.
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawnattr_destroy
function destroys a spawn attributes object.
A destroyed
.Fa attr
attributes object can be reinitialized using
.Fn posix_spawnattr_init .
The object should not be used after it has been destroyed.
.Pp
A spawn attributes object is of type
.Vt posix_spawnattr_t
(defined in
.In spawn.h )
and is used to specify the inheritance of process attributes across a
spawn operation.
.Pp
The resulting spawn attributes object (possibly modified by setting
individual attribute values), is used to modify the behavior of
.Fn posix_spawn
or
.Fn posix_spawnp .
After a spawn attributes object has been used to spawn a process by a
call to a
.Fn posix_spawn
or
.Fn posix_spawnp ,
any function affecting the attributes object (including destruction)
will not affect any process that has been spawned in this way.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn posix_spawnattr_init
and
.Fn posix_spawnattr_destroy
return zero;
otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn posix_spawnattr_init
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Insufficient memory exists to initialize the spawn attributes object.
