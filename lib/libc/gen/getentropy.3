.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn getentropy "void *buf" "size_t buflen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn getentropy
fills a buffer with high-quality random data.
.Pp
The maximum
.Fa buflen
permitted is 256 bytes.
.Pp
If it does not produce an error,
.Fn getentropy
always provides the requested number of bytes of random data.

Similar to reading from
.Pa /dev/urandom
just after boot,
.Fn getentropy
may block until the system has collected enough entropy to seed the CSPRNG.

The
.Fn getentropy
function is implemented using
.Xr getrandom 2 .

.Fn getentropy
will succeed unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
