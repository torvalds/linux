.Dt GETDOMAINNAME 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getdomainname ,
.Nm setdomainname
.Nd get/set YP domain name of current host
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn getdomainname "char *name" "size_t namelen"
.Ft int
.Fn setdomainname "const char *name" "size_t namelen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getdomainname
function returns the YP domain name for the current processor, as
previously set by
.Fn setdomainname .
The parameter
.Fa namelen
specifies the size of the
.Fa name
array.
If insufficient space is provided, the returned name is truncated.
The returned name is always NUL terminated.
.Pp
.Fn setdomainname
sets the domain name of the host machine to be
.Fa name ,
which has length
.Fa namelen .
This call is restricted to the superuser and
is normally used only when the system is bootstrapped.
Under normal operation once the domainname is set, it cannot be
changed.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the call succeeds, a value of 0 is returned.
If the call fails, a value of \-1 is returned and an error code is
placed in the global variable
.Va errno .
.Sh ERRORS
The following errors may be returned by these calls:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa name
parameter gave an
invalid address.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The caller tried to set the domain name and was not the superuser.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr domainname 1 ,
.Xr sysctl 2 ,
.Xr gethostid 3 ,
.Xr gethostname 3 ,
.Xr sysctl 8 ,
.Xr yp 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
function call appeared in
SunOS 3.x.
.Sh BUGS
Domain names are limited to
.Dv MAXHOSTNAMELEN
(from
.In sys/param.h )
characters, currently 256.
This includes the terminating NUL character.
.Pp
If the buffer passed to
.Fn getdomainname
is too small, other operating systems may not guarantee termination with NUL.
