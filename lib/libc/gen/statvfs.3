.Sh NAME
.Nm statvfs ,
.Nm fstatvfs
.Nd get file system statistics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/statvfs.h
.Ft int
.Fn statvfs "const char *path" "struct statvfs *buf"
.Ft int
.Fn fstatvfs "int fd" "struct statvfs *buf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn statvfs
returns information about a mounted file system.
.Fa path
is the path name of any file within the mounted file system.
.Fa buf
is a pointer to a
.Nm statvfs
structure defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
struct statvfs {
        unsigned long f_bsize;    /* file system block size */
        unsigned long f_frsize;   /* fundamental file system block size */
        fsblkcnt_t    f_blocks;   /* number of blocks (unit f_frsize) */
        fsblkcnt_t    f_bfree;    /* free blocks in file system */
        fsblkcnt_t    f_bavail;   /* free blocks for non-root */
        fsfilcnt_t    f_files;    /* total file inodes */
        fsfilcnt_t    f_ffree;    /* free file inodes */
        fsfilcnt_t    f_favail;   /* free file inodes for non-root */
        unsigned long f_fsid;     /* file system id */
        unsigned long f_flag;     /* bit mask of f_flag values */
        unsigned long f_namemax;  /* maximum filename length */
};

#define ST_RDONLY     0x0001UL    /* read-only filesystem */
#define	ST_NOSUID     0x0002UL    /* nosuid flag set */
.Ed
.Pp
The fields of type
.Vt fsblkcnt_t
are reported in units of
.Fa f_frsize .
.Pp
.Fn fstatvfs
returns the same information about an open file referenced by descriptor
.Fa fd .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn statvfs
fails if one or more of the following are true:

is not a directory.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeded
.Dv NAME_MAX
characters, or an entire pathname (including the terminating NUL)
exceeded
.Dv PATH_MAX
bytes.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The file referred to by
.Fa path
does not exist.
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix of
.Fa path .
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
.Fa path .
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa buf
or

points to an invalid address.
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
