.Dt TIMES 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm times
.Nd process times
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/times.h
.Ft clock_t
.Fn times "struct tms *tp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This interface is obsoleted by
.Xr clock_gettime 2
and
.Xr getrusage 2 .
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn times
function fills in the structure pointed to by
.Fa tp
with time-accounting information.
.Pp
The
.Vt tms
structure is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct tms {
	clock_t tms_utime;
	clock_t tms_stime;
	clock_t tms_cutime;
	clock_t tms_cstime;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The elements of this structure are defined as follows:
.Bl -tag -width tms_cutime
.It Fa tms_utime
The
.Tn CPU
time charged for the execution of user instructions.
.It Fa tms_stime
The
.Tn CPU
time charged for execution by the system on behalf of
the process.
.It Fa tms_cutime
The sum of
.Fa tms_utime
and
.Fa tms_cutime
for all of the child processes.
.It Fa tms_cstime
The sum of
.Fa tms_stime
and
.Fa tms_cstime
for all of the child processes.
.El
.Pp
All times are in
.Dv CLK_TCK Ns s
of a second.
.Pp
The times of a terminated child process are included in the
.Fa tms_cutime
and
.Fa tms_cstime
elements of the parent when one of the
.Xr wait 2
functions returns the process ID of the terminated child to the parent.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn times
returns the value of real time,
in
.Dv CLK_TCK Ns s
of a second,
elapsed since an arbitrary point in the past.
This point does not change between invocations of
.Fn times
so two such return values constitute a real time interval.
.Pp
On failure,
.Fn times
returns
.Li "(clock_t)-1"
and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn times
function may fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for
.Xr clock_gettime 2
and
.Xr getrusage 2 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr time 1 ,
.Xr clock_gettime 2 ,
.Xr getrusage 2 ,
.Xr wait 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn times
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-88 .
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Fn times
function first appeared in
.At v3 .
