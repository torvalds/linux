.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm posix_spawnattr_getflags ,
.Nm posix_spawnattr_setflags
.Nd get or set flags of a posix_spawn attributes object
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In spawn.h
.Ft int
.Fn posix_spawnattr_getflags "const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr" "short *restrict flags"
.Ft int
.Fn posix_spawnattr_setflags "posix_spawnattr_t *attr" "short flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn posix_spawnattr_getflags
and
.Fn posix_spawnattr_setflags
functions are used to get or set the flags part of a
.Xr posix_spawn 3
attribute object referenced by
.Fa attr .
.Pp
Flag values are OR-ed from the following flags:
.Bl -tag -width POSIX_SPAWN
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS
Reset the effective user and group ID of the child process to the parent's
real user and group ID;
see
.Xr setegid 2 .
.Pp
If the new process is created from a set-user-ID or set-group-ID file, usual
.Xr execve 2
semantics take precedence.
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP
Set the process group of the child process according to the pgroup attribute
of the object; see
.Xr posix_spawnattr_getpgroup 3
and
.Xr setpgid 2 .
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF
Reset signals set by
.Xr posix_spawnattr_setsigdefault 3
to their default value in the child process.
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK
Set the signal mask of the child process according
to the value set by
.Xr posix_spawnattr_setsigmask 3 ,
using
.Xr sigprocmask 2 .
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM
Set the scheduling parameter of the child process
according to the value set by
.Xr posix_spawnattr_setschedparam 3
.Po
mandated by
.St -p1003.1-2001 ,
this implementation currently does nothing
.Pc .
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER
Set the scheduler policy of the child process
according to the value set by
.Xr posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy 3
.Po
mandated by
.St -p1003.1-2001 ,
this implementation currently does nothing
.Pc .
.El
.Pp
.Xr posix_spawnattr_init 3
initializes this value to no flags set.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Both functions return 0.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr posix_spawnattr_init 3
.Sh STANDARDS
Both functions conform to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
