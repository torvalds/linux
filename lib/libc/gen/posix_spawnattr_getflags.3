.Nm posix_spawnattr_getflags ,
.Nm posix_spawnattr_setflags
.Nd "get and set the spawn-flags attribute of a spawn attributes object"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In spawn.h
.Ft int
.Fn posix_spawnattr_getflags "const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr" "short *restrict flags"
.Ft int
.Fn posix_spawnattr_setflags "posix_spawnattr_t *attr" "short flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn posix_spawnattr_getflags
function obtains the value of the spawn-flags attribute from the
attributes object referenced by
.Fa attr .
.Pp
The
.Fn posix_spawnattr_setflags
function sets the spawn-flags attribute in an initialized
attributes object referenced by
.Fa attr .
.Pp
The spawn-flags attribute is used to indicate which process attributes
are to be changed in the new process image when invoking
.Fn posix_spawn
or
.Fn posix_spawnp .
It is the bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of the following flags
(see
.Fn posix_spawn ) :
.Bl -tag -width "POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM" -offset indent
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM
.It Dv POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER
.El

These flags are defined in
.In spawn.h .
The default value of this attribute is as if no flags were set.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn posix_spawnattr_getflags
and
.Fn posix_spawnattr_setflags
functions return zero.
