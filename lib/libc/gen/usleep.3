.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm usleep
.Nd suspend process execution for an interval measured in microseconds
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn usleep "useconds_t microseconds"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn usleep
function suspends execution of the calling process until either
.Fa microseconds
microseconds have elapsed or a signal is delivered to the process and its
action is to invoke a signal-catching function or to terminate the
process.
System activity may lengthen the sleep by an indeterminate amount.
.Pp
This function is implemented using
.Xr nanosleep 2
by pausing for
.Fa microseconds
microseconds or until a signal occurs.
Consequently, in this implementation,
sleeping has no effect on the state of process timers,
and there is no special handling for SIGALRM.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std usleep
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn usleep
function
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINTR
A signal was delivered to the process and its
action was to invoke a signal-catching function.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nanosleep 2 ,
.Xr sleep 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn usleep
function appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
