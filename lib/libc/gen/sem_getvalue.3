is actually run.

.Xr sem_wait 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn sem_getvalue
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-96 .
.Pp
The value of the semaphore is never negative, even if there are threads blocked
on the semaphore.
.Tn POSIX
is somewhat ambiguous in its wording with regard to
what the value of the semaphore should be if there are blocked waiting threads,
but this behavior is conformant, given the wording of the specification.
