.Ft int
.Fn getvfsbyname "const char *name" "struct xvfsconf *vfc"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getvfsbyname
function provides access to information about a
file system module that is configured in the kernel.
If successful,
the requested file system
.Fa xvfsconf
is returned in the location pointed to by
.Fa vfc .
The fields in a
.Dq Li struct xvfsconf
are defined as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width vfc_refcount
.It vfc_name
the name of the file system
.It vfc_typenum
the file system type number assigned by the kernel
.It vfc_refcount
the number of active mount points using the file system
.It vfc_flags
flag bits, as described below
.El
.Pp
The flags are defined as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width VFCF_DELEGADMIN -compact
.It Dv VFCF_STATIC
statically compiled into kernel
.It Dv VFCF_NETWORK
may get data over the network
.It Dv VFCF_READONLY
writes are not implemented
.It Dv VFCF_SYNTHETIC
data does not represent real files
.It Dv VFCF_LOOPBACK
aliases some other mounted FS
.It Dv VFCF_UNICODE
stores file names as Unicode
.It Dv VFCF_JAIL
can be mounted from within a jail if
.Va allow.mount
and
.Va allow.mount.<vfc_name>
jail parameters are set
.It Dv VFCF_DELEGADMIN
supports delegated administration if
.Va vfs.usermount
sysctl is set to
.Dv 1

.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std getvfsbyname
.Sh ERRORS
The following errors may be reported:
.Bl -tag -width Er
