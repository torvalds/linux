.Sh NAME
.Nm sysconf
.Nd get configurable system variables
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft long
.Fn sysconf "int name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sysconf
function provides a method for applications to determine the current
value of a configurable system limit or option variable.
The
.Fa name
argument specifies the system variable to be queried.
Symbolic constants for each name value are found in the include file
.In unistd.h .

The maximum number of weights that can be assigned to any entry of
the LC_COLLATE order keyword in the locale definition file.
.It Li _SC_EXPR_NEST_MAX
The maximum number of expressions that can be nested within
parentheses by the

utility.
.It Li _SC_LINE_MAX

permitted when using interval notation.
.It Li _SC_2_VERSION

.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the call to
.Fn sysconf
is not successful, \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
Otherwise, if the variable is associated with functionality that is not
supported, \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is not modified.
Otherwise, the current variable value is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn sysconf
function may fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library function
.Xr sysctl 2 .
In addition, the following error may be reported:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value of the
.Fa name
argument is invalid.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pathconf 2 ,
.Xr sysctl 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn sysconf
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-88 .
The constants
.Li _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF
and
.Li _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN
are not part of the standard, but are provided by many systems.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn sysconf
function first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The value for _SC_STREAM_MAX is a minimum maximum, and required to be
the same as ANSI C's FOPEN_MAX, so the returned value is a ridiculously
small and misleading number.
