.Dt STRINGLIST 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm stringlist ,
.Nm sl_init ,
.Nm sl_add ,
.Nm sl_free ,
.Nm sl_find
.Nd stringlist manipulation functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stringlist.h
.Ft StringList *
.Fn sl_init
.Ft int
.Fn sl_add "StringList *sl" "char *item"
.Ft void
.Fn sl_free "StringList *sl" "int freeall"
.Ft char *
.Fn sl_find "StringList *sl" "const char *item"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions manipulate stringlists, which are lists of
strings that extend automatically if necessary.
.Pp
The
.Vt StringList
structure has the following definition:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
typedef struct _stringlist {
	char	**sl_str;
	size_t	  sl_max;
	size_t	  sl_cur;
} StringList;
.Ed
.Bl -tag -width "sl_str" -offset indent
.It Va sl_str
a pointer to the base of the array containing the list.
.It Va sl_max
the size of
.Va sl_str .
.It Va sl_cur
the offset in
.Va sl_str
of the current element.
.El
.Pp
The following stringlist manipulation functions are available:
.Bl -tag -width "sl_init()"
.It Fn sl_init
Create a stringlist.
Returns a pointer to a
.Vt StringList ,
or
.Dv NULL
in case of failure.
.It Fn sl_free
Releases memory occupied by
.Fa sl
and the
.Fa sl->sl_str
array.
If
.Fa freeall
is non-zero, then each of the items within
.Fa sl->sl_str
is released as well.
.It Fn sl_add
Add
.Fa item
to
.Fa sl->sl_str
at
.Fa sl->sl_cur ,
extending the size of
.Fa sl->sl_str .
Returns zero upon success, \-1 upon failure.
.It Fn sl_find
Find
.Fa item
in
.Fa sl ,
returning NULL if it is not found.
.El

.Xr free 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
functions appeared in
.Fx 2.2.6
and
.Nx 1.3 .
