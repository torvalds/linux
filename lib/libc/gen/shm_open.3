.Sh NAME
.Nm shm_open ,
.Nm shm_unlink ,
.Nm shm_mkstemp
.Nd create and destroy shared memory objects
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/mman.h
.Ft int
.Fn shm_open "const char *path" "int flags" "mode_t mode"
.Ft int
.Fn shm_unlink "const char *path"
.Ft int
.Fn shm_mkstemp "char *template"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn shm_open
function opens a shared memory object and returns a file descriptor suitable
for use with
.Xr mmap 2 .
The
.Fa flags
argument has the same meaning as provided to
.Xr open 2
and must include at least
.Dv O_RDONLY
or
.Dv O_RDWR
and may also include a combination of
.Dv O_CREAT , O_EXCL , O_CLOEXEC , O_CLOFORK , O_NOFOLLOW ,
or
.Dv O_TRUNC .
This implementation forces the
.Fa mode
to be 0600 or 0400, and prohibits sharing between different UIDs.
.Pp
.Fn shm_unlink
is used to remove a shared memory object.
The object is not freed until all references to it have been released via
.Xr close 2 .
.Pp
If a temporary shared memory object is desired, the
.Fn shm_mkstemp
function should be preferred as it avoids several possible security
holes that tend to appear in programs trying to create their own unique
temporary names.
The
.Fa template
argument is a string with at least six trailing Xs as described in
.Xr mkstemp 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn shm_open
and
.Fn shm_mkstemp
return a file descriptor on successful completion.
They may fail for any of the reasons listed in
.Xr open 2 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mmap 2
.Sh STANDARDS
.Fn shm_open
and
.Fn shm_unlink
appear in
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
Using
.Dv O_CLOEXEC ,
.Dv O_CLOFORK ,
or
.Dv O_NOFOLLOW
with
.Fn shm_open
is an extension to that standard.
This implementation deviates from the standard by permitting less sharing.
.Pp
.Fn shm_mkstemp
is an extension.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn shm_open ,
.Fn shm_unlink ,
and
.Fn shm_mkstemp
functions have been available since
.Ox 5.4 .
