.Sh NAME
.Nm modf ,
.Nm modff ,
.Nm modfl
.Nd extract signed integral and fractional values from floating-point number
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn modf "double value" "double *iptr"
.Ft float
.Fn modff "float value" "float *iptr"
.Ft long double
.Fn modfl "long double value" "long double *iptr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn modf ,
.Fn modff ,
and
.Fn modfl
functions break the argument
.Fa value
into integral and fractional parts, each of which has the
same sign as the argument.
It stores the integral part as a
floating point number
in the object pointed to by
.Fa iptr .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return the signed fractional part of
.Fa value .

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn modf ,
.Fn modff ,
and
.Fn modfl
functions conform to
.St -isoC-99 .
