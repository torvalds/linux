.Dt MODF 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm modf ,
.Nm modff ,
.Nm modfl
.Nd extract signed integral and fractional values from floating-point number
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libm
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn modf "double value" "double *iptr"
.Ft float
.Fn modff "float value" "float *iptr"
.Ft long double
.Fn modfl "long double value" "long double *iptr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn modf
function breaks the argument
.Fa value
into integral and fractional parts, each of which has the
same sign as the argument.
It stores the integral part as a
.Vt double
in the object pointed to by
.Fa iptr .
The
.Fn modff
function is a single precision version of
.Fn modf .
The
.Fn modfl
function is an extended precision version of
.Fn modf .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn modf ,
.Fn modff
and
.Fn modfl
functions return the signed fractional part of
.Fa value .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr frexp 3 ,
.Xr ldexp 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn modf
function conforms to
.St -ansiC .
