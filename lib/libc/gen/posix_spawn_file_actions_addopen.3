.Sh NAME
.Nm posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose ,
.Nm posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2 ,
.Nm posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen
.Nd add action to close, dup2 or open file descriptor to file actions object
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In spawn.h
.Ft int
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose "posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions" "int fildes"
.Ft int
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2 "posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions" "int fildes" "int newfildes"
.Ft int
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen "posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions" "int fildes" "const char *restrict path" "int oflag" "mode_t mode"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These function add an action to
.Xr close 2 ,
.Xr dup2 2 ,
or
.Xr open 2
a file descriptor
to a
.Xr posix_spawn 3
file actions object.
.Pp
Actions are executed in order in the child process:
.Bl -dash
.It
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose
function adds an action that causes
.Bd -literal -offset indent
close(fildes);
.Ed
.Pp
to be called.
.It
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2
function adds an action that causes
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dup2(fildes, newfildes);
.Ed
.Pp
to be called.
In addition, the action will cause the close-on-exec flag to be cleared on
.Fa newfildes ,
even if
.Fa newfildes
equals
.Fa fildes .
.It
The
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen
function adds an action that causes
.Bd -literal -offset indent
open(path, oflag, mode);
.Ed
.Pp
to be called and the result to be forced as
.Fa fildes
(if
.Fa fildes
was already open before this action, the old file descriptor
is closed before the action is performed).
.Pp
Note that
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen
makes a copy of the
.Fa path
argument.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, these functions return zero.
Otherwise they may return
.Er EINVAL
for negative file descriptors, or
.Er ENOMEM
if they run out of memory.
