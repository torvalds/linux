.Dt GETPROGNAME 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getprogname ,
.Nm setprogname
.Nd get or set the name of the current program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft const char *
.Fn getprogname "void"
.Ft void
.Fn setprogname "const char *name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These utility functions get and set the current program's name
as used by various error-reporting functions.
.Pp
.Fn getprogname
returns the name of the current program.
This function is typically useful when generating error messages
or other diagnostic output.
.Pp
The
.Fn setprogname
function sets the name of the program to be the last path component of the
.Fa name
argument.
Internally, only the pointer to the given string is kept as the program name,
so it should not be modified and the storage for the string must remain valid
for the rest of the program's lifetime.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr err 3 ,
.Xr setproctitle 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getprogname
and
.Fn setprogname
functions first appeared in
.Ox 5.4
as function-based wrappers around the
.Bx 4.4
.Va __progname
interface.
.Sh CAVEATS
The string returned by
.Fn getprogname
is supplied by the invoking process and should not be trusted by
setuid or setgid programs.
