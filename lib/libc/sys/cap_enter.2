.Dt CAP_ENTER 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cap_enter ,
.Nm cap_getmode
.Nd Capability mode system calls
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/capsicum.h
.Ft int
.Fn cap_enter "void"
.Ft int
.Fn cap_getmode "u_int *modep"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn cap_enter
places the current process into capability mode, a mode of execution in which
processes may only issue system calls operating on file descriptors or
reading limited global system state.
Access to global name spaces, such as file system or IPC name spaces, is
prevented.
If the process is already in a capability mode sandbox, the system call is a
no-op.
Future process descendants created with
.Xr fork 2
or
.Xr pdfork 2
will be placed in capability mode from inception.
.Pp
When combined with
.Xr cap_rights_limit 2 ,
.Xr cap_ioctls_limit 2 ,
.Xr cap_fcntls_limit 2 ,
.Fn cap_enter
may be used to create kernel-enforced sandboxes in which
appropriately-crafted applications or application components may be run.
.Pp
.Fn cap_getmode
returns a flag indicating whether or not the process is in a capability mode
sandbox.
.Sh RUN-TIME SETTINGS
If the
.Dv kern.trap_enotcap
sysctl MIB is set to a non-zero value, then for any process executing in a
capability mode sandbox, any syscall which results in either an
.Er ENOTCAPABLE
or
.Er ECAPMODE
error also generates the synchronous
.Dv SIGTRAP
signal to the thread on the syscall return.
On signal delivery, the
.Va si_errno
member of the
.Fa siginfo
signal handler parameter is set to the syscall error value,
and the
.Va si_code
member is set to
.Dv TRAP_CAP .
.Pp
See also the
.Dv PROC_TRAPCAP_CTL
and
.Dv PROC_TRAPCAP_STATUS
operations of the
.Xr procctl 2
function for similar per-process functionality.
.Sh CAVEAT
Creating effective process sandboxes is a tricky process that involves
identifying the least possible rights required by the process and then
passing those rights into the process in a safe manner.
Consumers of
.Fn cap_enter
should also be aware of other inherited rights, such as access to VM
resources, memory contents, and other process properties that should be
considered.
It is advisable to use
.Xr fexecve 2
to create a runtime environment inside the sandbox that has as few implicitly
acquired rights as possible.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std cap_enter cap_getmode
.Pp
When the process is in capability mode,
.Fn cap_getmode
sets the flag to a non-zero value.
A zero value means the process is not in capability mode.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn cap_enter
and
.Fn cap_getmode
system calls
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOSYS
The kernel is compiled without:
.Pp
.Cd "options CAPABILITY_MODE"
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_getmode
system call may also return the following error:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
Pointer
.Fa modep
points outside the process's allocated address space.
