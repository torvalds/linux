.Dt UMASK 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm umask
.Nd set file creation mode mask
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/stat.h
.Ft mode_t
.Fn umask "mode_t numask"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn umask
routine sets the process's file mode creation mask to
.Fa numask
and returns the previous value of the mask.
Only the read, write, and execute file permission bits of
.Fa numask
are honored, all others are ignored.
.Pp
The file mode creation mask is used by the
.Xr bind 2 ,
.Xr mkdir 2 ,
.Xr mkdirat 2 ,
.Xr mkfifo 2 ,
.Xr mkfifoat 2 ,
.Xr mknod 2 ,
.Xr mknodat 2 ,
.Xr open 2
and
.Xr openat 2
system calls to turn off corresponding bits requested in the file mode
(see
.Xr chmod 2 ) .
This clearing allows users to restrict the default access to their files.
.Pp
The default mask value is S_IWGRP|S_IWOTH (022, write access for the
owner only).
Child processes inherit the mask of the calling process.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The previous value of the file mode mask is returned by the call.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn umask
function is always successful.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh STANDARDS

.Fn umask
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .

.Fn umask
system call first appeared in
