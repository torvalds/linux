.Dt CAP_IOCTLS_LIMIT 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cap_ioctls_limit ,
.Nm cap_ioctls_get
.Nd manage allowed ioctl commands
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/capsicum.h
.Ft int
.Fn cap_ioctls_limit "int fd" "const unsigned long *cmds" "size_t ncmds"
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn cap_ioctls_get "int fd" "unsigned long *cmds" "size_t maxcmds"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
If a file descriptor is granted the
.Dv CAP_IOCTL
capability right, the list of allowed
.Xr ioctl 2
commands can be selectively reduced (but never expanded) with the
.Fn cap_ioctls_limit
system call.
The
.Fa cmds
argument is an array of
.Xr ioctl 2
commands and the
.Fa ncmds
argument specifies the number of elements in the array.
There can be up to
.Va 256
elements in the array.
Including an element that has been previously revoked will generate an error.
After a successful call only those listed in the array may be used.
.Pp
The list of allowed ioctl commands for a given file descriptor can be obtained
with the
.Fn cap_ioctls_get
system call.
The
.Fa cmds
argument points at memory that can hold up to
.Fa maxcmds
values.
The function populates the provided buffer with up to
.Fa maxcmds
elements, but always returns the total number of ioctl commands allowed for the
given file descriptor.
The total number of ioctls commands for the given file descriptor can be
obtained by passing
.Dv NULL as the
.Fa cmds
argument and
.Va 0
as the
.Fa maxcmds
argument.
If all ioctl commands are allowed
.Dv ( CAP_IOCTL
capability right is assigned to the file descriptor and the
.Fn cap_ioctls_limit
system call was never called for this file descriptor), the
.Fn cap_ioctls_get
system call will return
.Dv CAP_IOCTLS_ALL
and will not modify the buffer pointed to by the
.Fa cmds
argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std cap_ioctls_limit
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_ioctls_get
function, if successful, returns the total number of allowed ioctl commands or
the value
.Dv CAP_IOCTLS_ALL
if all ioctls commands are allowed.
On failure the value
.Va -1
is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn cap_ioctls_limit
succeeds unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa fd
argument is not a valid descriptor.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa cmds
argument points at an invalid address.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa ncmds
argument is greater than
.Va 256 .
.It Bq Er ENOTCAPABLE
.Fa cmds
would expand the list of allowed
.Xr ioctl 2
commands.
.El
.Pp
.Fn cap_ioctls_get
succeeds unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa fd
argument is not a valid descriptor.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa cmds
argument points at invalid address.
