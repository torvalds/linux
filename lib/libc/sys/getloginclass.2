.Dt GETLOGINCLASS 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getloginclass ,
.Nm setloginclass
.Nd get/set login class
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn getloginclass "char *name" "size_t len"
.Ft int
.Fn setloginclass "const char *name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getloginclass
routine returns the login class name associated with the calling process,
as previously set by
.Fn setloginclass .
The caller must provide the buffer
.Fa name
with length
.Fa len
bytes to hold the result.
The buffer should be at least
.Dv MAXLOGNAME
bytes in length.
.Pp
The
.Fn setloginclass
system call sets the login class of the calling process to
.Fa name .
This system call is restricted to the super-user, and is normally used
only when a new session is being created on behalf of the named user
(for example, at login time, or when a remote shell is invoked).
Processes inherit login class from their parents.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
The following errors may be returned by these calls:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa name
argument gave an invalid address.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa name
argument pointed to a string that was too long.
Login class names are limited to
.Dv MAXLOGNAME
(from
.In sys/param.h )
characters, currently 33 including null.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The caller tried to set the login class and was not the super-user.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
The size of the buffer is smaller than the result to be returned.
