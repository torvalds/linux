.Dt UNDELETE 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm undelete
.Nd attempt to recover a deleted file
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn undelete "const char *path"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn undelete
system call attempts to recover the deleted file named by
.Fa path .
Currently, this works only when the named object
is a whiteout in a union file system.
The system call removes the whiteout causing
any objects in a lower layer of the
union stack to become visible once more.
.Pp
Eventually, the
.Fn undelete
functionality may be expanded to other file systems able to recover
deleted files such as the log-structured file system.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
