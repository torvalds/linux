.Nd create and manage system jails
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/jail.h
.Ft int
.Fn jail "struct jail *jail"
.Ft int
.Fn jail_attach "int jid"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn jail
system call sets up a jail and locks the current process in it.
.Pp
The argument is a pointer to a structure describing the prison:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct jail {
	uint32_t	version;
	char		*path;
	char		*hostname;
	char		*jailname;
	unsigned int	ip4s;
	unsigned int	ip6s;
	struct in_addr	*ip4;
	struct in6_addr	*ip6;
};
.Ed
.Pp
.Dq Li version
defines the version of the API in use.
.Dv JAIL_API_VERSION
is defined for the current version.
.Pp
The
.Dq Li path
pointer should be set to the directory which is to be the root of the
prison.
.Pp
The
.Dq Li hostname
pointer can be set to the hostname of the prison.
This can be changed
from the inside of the prison.
.Pp
The
.Dq Li jailname
pointer is an optional name that can be assigned to the jail
for example for management purposes.
.Pp
The
.Dq Li ip4s
and
.Dq Li ip6s
give the numbers of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that will be passed
via their respective pointers.
.Pp
The
.Dq Li ip4
and
.Dq Li ip6
pointers can be set to an arrays of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to be assigned to
the prison, or NULL if none.
IPv4 addresses must be in network byte order.
.Pp
This is equivalent to, and deprecated in favor of, the
.Fn jail_set
system call (see below), with the parameters
.Va path ,
.Va host.hostname ,
.Va name ,
.Va ip4.addr ,
and
.Va ip6.addr ,
and with the
.Dv JAIL_ATTACH
flag.
.Pp
The
.Fn jail_set
system call creates a new jail, or modifies an existing one, and optionally
locks the current process in it.
Jail parameters are passed as an array of name-value pairs in the array
.Fa iov ,
containing
.Fa niov
elements.
Parameter names are a null-terminated string, and values may be strings,
integers, or other arbitrary data.
Some parameters are boolean, and do not have a value (their length is zero)
but are set by the name alone with or without a
.Dq no
prefix, e.g.
.Va persist
or
.Va nopersist .
Any parameters not set will be given default values, generally based on
the current environment.
.Pp
Jails have a set of core parameters, and modules can add their own jail
parameters.
The current set of available parameters, and their formats, can be
retrieved via the
.Va security.jail.param
sysctl MIB entry.
Notable parameters include those mentioned in the
.Fn jail
description above, as well as
.Va jid
and
.Va name ,
which identify the jail being created or modified.
See
.Xr jail 8
for more information on the core jail parameters.
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
arguments consists of one or more of the following flags:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv JAIL_CREATE
Create a new jail.
If a
.Va jid
or
.Va name
parameters exists, they must not refer to an existing jail.
.It Dv JAIL_UPDATE
Modify an existing jail.
One of the
.Va jid
or
.Va name
parameters must exist, and must refer to an existing jail.
If both
.Dv JAIL_CREATE
and
.Dv JAIL_UPDATE
are set, a jail will be created if it does not yet exist, and modified if it
does exist.
.It Dv JAIL_ATTACH
In addition to creating or modifying the jail, attach the current process to
it, as with the
.Fn jail_attach
system call.
.It Dv JAIL_DYING
Allow setting a jail that is in the process of being removed.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn jail_get
system call retrieves jail parameters, using the same name-value list as
.Fn jail_set
in the
.Fa iov
and
.Fa niov
arguments.
The jail to read can be specified by either
.Va jid
or
.Va name
by including those parameters in the list.
If they are included but are not intended to be the search key, they
should be cleared (zero and the empty string respectively).
.Pp
The special parameter
.Va lastjid
can be used to retrieve a list of all jails.
It will fetch the jail with the jid above and closest to the passed value.
The first jail (usually but not always jid 1) can be found by passing a
.Va lastjid
of zero.
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
arguments consists of one or more following flags:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv JAIL_DYING
Allow getting a jail that is in the process of being removed.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn jail_attach
system call attaches the current process to an existing jail,
identified by
.Fa jid .
.Pp
The
.Fn jail_remove
system call removes the jail identified by
.Fa jid .
It will kill all processes belonging to the jail, and remove any children
of that jail.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Fn jail ,
.Fn jail_set ,
and
.Fn jail_get
return a non-negative integer, termed the jail identifier (JID).
They return \-1 on failure, and set
.Va errno
to indicate the error.
.Pp
.Rv -std jail_attach jail_remove
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn jail
system call
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EPERM
This process is not allowed to create a jail, either because it is not
the super-user, or because it would exceed the jail's
.Va children.max
limit.

.Fa jail
points to an address outside the allocated address space of the process.
.It Bq Er EINVAL

and

call

.Xr chroot 2
manual page for details.
