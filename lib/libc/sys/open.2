.Dt OPEN 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm open , openat
.Nd open or create a file for reading, writing or executing
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In fcntl.h
.Ft int
.Fn open "const char *path" "int flags" "..."
.Ft int
.Fn openat "int fd" "const char *path" "int flags" "..."
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file name specified by
.Fa path
is opened
for either execution or reading and/or writing as specified by the
argument
.Fa flags
and the file descriptor returned to the calling process.
The
.Fa flags
argument may indicate the file is to be
created if it does not exist (by specifying the
.Dv O_CREAT
flag).
In this case
.Fn open
and
.Fn openat
require an additional argument
.Fa "mode_t mode" ,
and the file is created with mode
.Fa mode
as described in
.Xr chmod 2
and modified by the process' umask value (see
.Xr umask 2 ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn openat
function is equivalent to the
.Fn open
function except in the case where the
.Fa path
specifies a relative path, or the
.Dv O_BENEATH
flag is provided.
For
.Fn openat
and relative
.Fa path ,
the file to be opened is determined relative to the directory
associated with the file descriptor
.Fa fd
instead of the current working directory.
The
.Fa flag
parameter and the optional fourth parameter correspond exactly to
the parameters of
.Fn open .
If
.Fn openat
is passed the special value
.Dv AT_FDCWD
in the
.Fa fd
parameter, the current working directory is used
and the behavior is identical to a call to
.Fn open .
.Pp
When
.Fn openat
is called with an absolute
.Fa path
without the
.Dv O_BENEATH
flag, it ignores the
.Fa fd
argument.
When
.Dv O_BENEATH
is specified with an absolute
.Fa path ,
a directory passed by the
.Fa fd
argument is used as the topping point for the resolution.
See the definition of the
.Dv O_BENEATH
flag below.
.Pp
In
.Xr capsicum 4
capability mode,
.Fn open
is not permitted.
The
.Fa path
argument to
.Fn openat
must be strictly relative to a file descriptor
.Fa fd ,
as defined in
.Pa sys/kern/vfs_lookup.c .
.Fa path
must not be an absolute path and must not contain ".." components
which cause the path resolution to escape the directory hierarchy
starting at
.Fa fd .
Additionally, no symbolic link in
.Fa path
may target absolute path or contain escaping ".." components.
.Fa fd
must not be
.Dv AT_FDCWD .
.Pp
If the
.Dv vfs.lookup_cap_dotdot
.Xr sysctl 3
MIB is set to zero, ".." components in the paths,
used in capability mode, or with the
.Dv O_BENEATH
flag, are completely disabled.
If the
.Dv vfs.lookup_cap_dotdot_nonlocal
MIB is set to zero, ".." is not allowed if found on non-local filesystem.
.Pp
The flags specified are formed by
.Em or Ns 'ing
the following values
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
O_RDONLY	open for reading only
O_WRONLY	open for writing only
O_RDWR		open for reading and writing
O_EXEC		open for execute only
O_NONBLOCK	do not block on open
O_APPEND	append on each write
O_CREAT		create file if it does not exist
O_TRUNC		truncate size to 0
O_EXCL		error if create and file exists
O_SHLOCK	atomically obtain a shared lock
O_EXLOCK	atomically obtain an exclusive lock
O_DIRECT	eliminate or reduce cache effects
O_FSYNC		synchronous writes
O_SYNC		synchronous writes
O_NOFOLLOW	do not follow symlinks
O_NOCTTY	ignored
O_TTY_INIT	ignored
O_DIRECTORY	error if file is not a directory
O_CLOEXEC	set FD_CLOEXEC upon open
O_VERIFY	verify the contents of the file
O_BENEATH	require path to be strictly relative to topping directory
.Ed
.Pp
Opening a file with
.Dv O_APPEND
set causes each write on the file
to be appended to the end.
If
.Dv O_TRUNC
is specified and the
file exists, the file is truncated to zero length.
If
.Dv O_EXCL
is set with
.Dv O_CREAT
and the file already
exists,
.Fn open
returns an error.
This may be used to
implement a simple exclusive access locking mechanism.
If
.Dv O_EXCL
is set and the last component of the pathname is
a symbolic link,
.Fn open
will fail even if the symbolic
link points to a non-existent name.
If the
.Dv O_NONBLOCK
flag is specified and the
.Fn open
system call would result
in the process being blocked for some reason (e.g., waiting for
carrier on a dialup line),
.Fn open
returns immediately.
The descriptor remains in non-blocking mode for subsequent operations.
.Pp
If
.Dv O_FSYNC
is used in the mask, all writes will
immediately be written to disk,
the kernel will not cache written data
and all writes on the descriptor will not return until
the data to be written completes.
.Pp
.Dv O_SYNC
is a synonym for
.Dv O_FSYNC
required by
.Tn POSIX .
.Pp
If
.Dv O_NOFOLLOW
is used in the mask and the target file passed to
.Fn open
is a symbolic link then the
.Fn open
will fail.
.Pp
When opening a file, a lock with
.Xr flock 2
semantics can be obtained by setting
.Dv O_SHLOCK
for a shared lock, or
.Dv O_EXLOCK
for an exclusive lock.
If creating a file with
.Dv O_CREAT ,
the request for the lock will never fail
(provided that the underlying file system supports locking).
.Pp
.Dv O_DIRECT
may be used to minimize or eliminate the cache effects of reading and writing.
The system will attempt to avoid caching the data you read or write.
If it cannot avoid caching the data,
it will minimize the impact the data has on the cache.
Use of this flag can drastically reduce performance if not used with care.
.Pp
.Dv O_NOCTTY
may be used to ensure the OS does not assign this file as the
controlling terminal when it opens a tty device.
This is the default on
.Fx ,
but is present for
.Tn POSIX
compatibility.
The
.Fn open
system call will not assign controlling terminals on
.Fx .
.Pp
.Dv O_TTY_INIT
may be used to ensure the OS restores the terminal attributes when
initially opening a TTY.
This is the default on
.Fx ,
but is present for
.Tn POSIX
compatibility.
The initial call to
.Fn open
on a TTY will always restore default terminal attributes on
.Fx .
.Pp
.Dv O_DIRECTORY
may be used to ensure the resulting file descriptor refers to a
directory.
This flag can be used to prevent applications with elevated privileges
from opening files which are even unsafe to open with
.Dv O_RDONLY ,
such as device nodes.
.Pp
.Dv O_CLOEXEC
may be used to set
.Dv FD_CLOEXEC
flag for the newly returned file descriptor.
.Pp
.Dv O_VERIFY
may be used to indicate to the kernel that the contents of the file should
be verified before allowing the open to proceed.
The details of what
.Dq verified
means is implementation specific.
The run-time linker (rtld) uses this flag to ensure shared objects have
been verified before operating on them.
.Pp
.Dv O_BENEATH
returns
.Er ENOTCAPABLE
if the specified relative path, after resolving all symlinks and ".."
references, does not reside in the directory hierarchy of
children beneath the topping directory.
Topping directory is the process current directory if relative
.Fa path
is used for
.Fn open ,
and the directory referenced by the
.Fa fd
argument when using
.Fn openat .
If the specified path is absolute,
.Dv O_BENEATH
allows arbitrary prefix that ends up at the topping directory,
after which all further resolved components must be under it.
.Pp
If successful,
.Fn open
returns a non-negative integer, termed a file descriptor.
It returns \-1 on failure.
The file pointer used to mark the current position within the
file is set to the beginning of the file.
.Pp
If a sleeping open of a device node from
.Xr devfs 5
is interrupted by a signal, the call always fails with
.Er EINTR ,
even if the
.Dv SA_RESTART
flag is set for the signal.
A sleeping open of a fifo (see
.Xr mkfifo 2 )
is restarted as normal.
.Pp
When a new file is created it is given the group of the directory
which contains it.
.Pp
Unless
.Dv O_CLOEXEC
flag was specified,
the new descriptor is set to remain open across
.Xr execve 2
system calls; see
.Xr close 2 ,
.Xr fcntl 2
and
.Dv O_CLOEXEC
description.
.Pp
The system imposes a limit on the number of file descriptors
open simultaneously by one process.
The
.Xr getdtablesize 2
system call returns the current system limit.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Fn open
and
.Fn openat
return a non-negative integer, termed a file descriptor.
They return \-1 on failure, and set
.Va errno
to indicate the error.

.Sh STANDARDS
These functions are specified by

.Fx
sets
.Va errno
to
.Er EMLINK instead of
.Er ELOOP
as specified by
.Tn POSIX
when
.Dv O_NOFOLLOW
is set in flags and the final component of pathname is a symbolic link
to distinguish it from the case of too many symbolic link traversals
in one of its non-final components.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn open
function appeared in
.At v1 .
The
.Fn openat
function was introduced in
.Fx 8.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The Open Group Extended API Set 2 specification requires that the test
for whether
.Fa fd
is searchable is based on whether
.Fa fd
is open for searching, not whether the underlying directory currently
permits searches.
The present implementation of the
.Fa openat
checks the current permissions of directory instead.
