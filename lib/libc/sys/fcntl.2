.Sh NAME
.Nm fcntl
.Nd file control
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In fcntl.h
.Ft int
.Fn fcntl "int fd" "int cmd" "..."
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fcntl
system call provides for control over descriptors.
The argument
.Fa fd
is a descriptor to be operated on by
.Fa cmd
as described below.
Depending on the value of
.Fa cmd ,
.Fn fcntl
can take an additional third argument
.Fa "int arg" .
.Bl -tag -width F_DUP2FD_CLOEXEC
.It Dv F_DUPFD
Return a new descriptor as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset 4n
.It
Lowest numbered available descriptor greater than or equal to
.Fa arg .
.It
Same object references as the original descriptor.
.It
New descriptor shares the same file offset if the object
was a file.
.It
Same access mode (read, write or read/write).
.It
Same file status flags (i.e., both file descriptors
share the same file status flags).
.It
The close-on-exec flag
.Dv FD_CLOEXEC
associated with the new file descriptor is cleared, so the file descriptor is
to remain open across
.Xr execve 2
system calls.
.El
.It Dv F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC
Like
.Dv F_DUPFD ,
but the
.Dv FD_CLOEXEC
flag associated with the new file descriptor is set, so the file descriptor
is closed when
.Xr execve 2
system call executes.
.It Dv F_DUP2FD
It is functionally equivalent to
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dup2(fd, arg)
.Ed
.It Dv F_DUP2FD_CLOEXEC
Like
.Dv F_DUP2FD ,
but the
.Dv FD_CLOEXEC
flag associated with the new file descriptor is set.
.Pp
The
.Dv F_DUP2FD
and
.Dv F_DUP2FD_CLOEXEC
constants are not portable, so they should not be used if
portability is needed.
Use
.Fn dup2
instead of
.Dv F_DUP2FD .
.It Dv F_GETFD
Get the close-on-exec flag associated with the file descriptor
.Fa fd
as
.Dv FD_CLOEXEC .
If the returned value ANDed with
.Dv FD_CLOEXEC
is 0,
the file will remain open across
.Fn exec ,
otherwise the file will be closed upon execution of
.Fn exec
.Fa ( arg
is ignored).
.It Dv F_SETFD
Set the close-on-exec flag associated with
.Fa fd
to
.Fa arg ,
where
.Fa arg
is either 0 or
.Dv FD_CLOEXEC ,
as described above.
.It Dv F_GETFL
Get descriptor status flags, as described below
.Fa ( arg
is ignored).
.It Dv F_SETFL
Set descriptor status flags to
.Fa arg .
.It Dv F_GETOWN
Get the process ID or process group
currently receiving
.Dv SIGIO
and
.Dv SIGURG
signals; process groups are returned
as negative values
.Fa ( arg
is ignored).
.It Dv F_SETOWN
Set the process or process group
to receive
.Dv SIGIO
and
.Dv SIGURG
signals;
process groups are specified by supplying
.Fa arg
as negative, otherwise
.Fa arg
is interpreted as a process ID.
.It Dv F_READAHEAD
Set or clear the read ahead amount for sequential access to the third
argument,
.Fa arg ,
which is rounded up to the nearest block size.
A zero value in
.Fa arg
turns off read ahead, a negative value restores the system default.
.It Dv F_RDAHEAD
Equivalent to Darwin counterpart which sets read ahead amount of 128KB
when the third argument,
.Fa arg
is non-zero.
A zero value in
.Fa arg
turns off read ahead.
.El
.Pp
The flags for the
.Dv F_GETFL
and
.Dv F_SETFL
flags are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width O_NONBLOCKX
.It Dv O_NONBLOCK
Non-blocking I/O; if no data is available to a
.Xr read 2
system call, or if a
.Xr write 2
operation would block,
the read or write call returns -1 with the error
.Er EAGAIN .
.It Dv O_APPEND
Force each write to append at the end of file;
corresponds to the
.Dv O_APPEND
flag of
.Xr open 2 .
.It Dv O_DIRECT
Minimize or eliminate the cache effects of reading and writing.
The system
will attempt to avoid caching the data you read or write.
If it cannot
avoid caching the data, it will minimize the impact the data has on the cache.
Use of this flag can drastically reduce performance if not used with care.
.It Dv O_ASYNC
Enable the
.Dv SIGIO
signal to be sent to the process group
when I/O is possible, e.g.,
upon availability of data to be read.
.El
.Pp
Several commands are available for doing advisory file locking;
they all operate on the following structure:
.Bd -literal
struct flock {
	off_t	l_start;	/* starting offset */
	off_t	l_len;		/* len = 0 means until end of file */
	pid_t	l_pid;		/* lock owner */
	short	l_type;		/* lock type: read/write, etc. */
	short	l_whence;	/* type of l_start */
	int	l_sysid;	/* remote system id or zero for local */
};
.Ed
The commands available for advisory record locking are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width F_SETLKWX
.It Dv F_GETLK
Get the first lock that blocks the lock description pointed to by the
third argument,
.Fa arg ,
taken as a pointer to a
.Fa "struct flock"
(see above).
The information retrieved overwrites the information passed to
.Fn fcntl
in the
.Fa flock
structure.
If no lock is found that would prevent this lock from being created,
the structure is left unchanged by this system call except for the
lock type which is set to
.Dv F_UNLCK .
.It Dv F_SETLK
Set or clear a file segment lock according to the lock description
pointed to by the third argument,
.Fa arg ,
taken as a pointer to a
.Fa "struct flock"
(see above).
.Dv F_SETLK
is used to establish shared (or read) locks
.Pq Dv F_RDLCK
or exclusive (or write) locks,
.Pq Dv F_WRLCK ,
as well as remove either type of lock
.Pq Dv F_UNLCK .
If a shared or exclusive lock cannot be set,
.Fn fcntl
returns immediately with
.Er EAGAIN .
.It Dv F_SETLKW
This command is the same as
.Dv F_SETLK
except that if a shared or exclusive lock is blocked by other locks,
the process waits until the request can be satisfied.
If a signal that is to be caught is received while
.Fn fcntl
is waiting for a region, the
.Fn fcntl
will be interrupted if the signal handler has not specified the
.Dv SA_RESTART
(see
.Xr sigaction 2 ) .
.El
.Pp
When a shared lock has been set on a segment of a file,
other processes can set shared locks on that segment
or a portion of it.
A shared lock prevents any other process from setting an exclusive
lock on any portion of the protected area.
A request for a shared lock fails if the file descriptor was not
opened with read access.
.Pp
An exclusive lock prevents any other process from setting a shared lock or
an exclusive lock on any portion of the protected area.
A request for an exclusive lock fails if the file was not
opened with write access.
.Pp
The value of
.Fa l_whence
is
.Dv SEEK_SET ,
.Dv SEEK_CUR ,
or
.Dv SEEK_END
to indicate that the relative offset,
.Fa l_start
bytes, will be measured from the start of the file,
current position, or end of the file, respectively.
The value of
.Fa l_len
is the number of consecutive bytes to be locked.
If
.Fa l_len
is negative,
.Fa l_start
means end edge of the region.
The
.Fa l_pid
and
.Fa l_sysid
fields are only used with
.Dv F_GETLK
to return the process ID of the process holding a blocking lock and
the system ID of the system that owns that process.
Locks created by the local system will have a system ID of zero.
After a successful
.Dv F_GETLK
request, the value of
.Fa l_whence
is
.Dv SEEK_SET .
.Pp
Locks may start and extend beyond the current end of a file,
but may not start or extend before the beginning of the file.
A lock is set to extend to the largest possible value of the
file offset for that file if
.Fa l_len
is set to zero.
If
.Fa l_whence
and
.Fa l_start
point to the beginning of the file, and
.Fa l_len
is zero, the entire file is locked.
If an application wishes only to do entire file locking, the
.Xr flock 2
system call is much more efficient.
.Pp
There is at most one type of lock set for each byte in the file.
Before a successful return from an
.Dv F_SETLK
or an
.Dv F_SETLKW
request when the calling process has previously existing locks
on bytes in the region specified by the request,
the previous lock type for each byte in the specified
region is replaced by the new lock type.
As specified above under the descriptions
of shared locks and exclusive locks, an
.Dv F_SETLK
or an
.Dv F_SETLKW
request fails or blocks respectively when another process has existing
locks on bytes in the specified region and the type of any of those
locks conflicts with the type specified in the request.
.Pp
The queuing for
.Dv F_SETLKW
requests on local files is fair;
that is, while the thread is blocked,
subsequent requests conflicting with its requests will not be granted,
even if these requests do not conflict with existing locks.
.Pp
This interface follows the completely stupid semantics of System V and
.St -p1003.1-88
that require that all locks associated with a file for a given process are
removed when
.Em any
file descriptor for that file is closed by that process.
This semantic means that applications must be aware of any files that
a subroutine library may access.
For example if an application for updating the password file locks the
password file database while making the update, and then calls
.Xr getpwnam 3
to retrieve a record,
the lock will be lost because
.Xr getpwnam 3
opens, reads, and closes the password database.
The database close will release all locks that the process has
associated with the database, even if the library routine never
requested a lock on the database.
Another minor semantic problem with this interface is that
locks are not inherited by a child process created using the
.Xr fork 2
system call.
The
.Xr flock 2
interface has much more rational last close semantics and
allows locks to be inherited by child processes.
The
.Xr flock 2
system call is recommended for applications that want to ensure the integrity
of their locks when using library routines or wish to pass locks
to their children.
.Pp
The
.Fn fcntl ,
.Xr flock 2 ,
and
.Xr lockf 3
locks are compatible.
Processes using different locking interfaces can cooperate
over the same file safely.
However, only one of such interfaces should be used within
the same process.
If a file is locked by a process through
.Xr flock 2 ,
any record within the file will be seen as locked
from the viewpoint of another process using
.Fn fcntl
or
.Xr lockf 3 ,
and vice versa.
Note that
.Fn fcntl F_GETLK
returns \-1 in
.Fa l_pid
if the process holding a blocking lock previously locked the
file descriptor by
.Xr flock 2 .
.Pp
All locks associated with a file for a given process are
removed when the process terminates.
.Pp
All locks obtained before a call to
.Xr execve 2
remain in effect until the new program releases them.
If the new program does not know about the locks, they will not be
released until the program exits.
.Pp
A potential for deadlock occurs if a process controlling a locked region
is put to sleep by attempting to lock the locked region of another process.
This implementation detects that sleeping until a locked region is unlocked
would cause a deadlock and fails with an
.Er EDEADLK
error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES

.Fa cmd
as follows:
.Bl -tag -width F_GETOWNX -offset indent

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Dv F_DUP2FD
constant is non portable.
It is provided for compatibility with AIX and Solaris.
.Pp
Per
.St -susv4 ,
a call with
.Dv F_SETLKW
should fail with
.Bq Er EINTR
after any caught signal
and should continue waiting during thread suspension such as a stop signal.
However, in this implementation a call with
.Dv F_SETLKW
is restarted after catching a signal with a
.Dv SA_RESTART
handler or a thread suspension such as a stop signal.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn fcntl
system call appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Pp
The
.Dv F_DUP2FD
constant first appeared in
.Fx 7.1 .
