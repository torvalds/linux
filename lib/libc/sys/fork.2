.Dt FORK 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fork
.Nd create a new process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft pid_t
.Fn fork void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn fork
causes creation of a new process.
The new process (child process) is an exact copy of the
calling process (parent process) except for the following:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
The child process has a unique process ID,
which also does not match any existing process group ID.
.It
The child process has a different parent
process ID (i.e., the process ID of the parent process).
.It
The child process has a single thread.
.It
The child process has its own copy of the parent's descriptors.
These descriptors reference the same underlying objects, so that,
for instance, file pointers in file objects are shared between
the child and the parent, so that an
.Xr lseek 2
on a descriptor in the child process can affect a subsequent
.Xr read 2
or
.Xr write 2
by the parent.
This descriptor copying is also used by the shell to
establish standard input and output for newly created processes
as well as to set up pipes.
.It
The child process has no
.Xr fcntl 2 Ns -style
file locks.
.It
The child process' resource utilizations
are set to 0; see
.Xr getrusage 2 .
.It
All interval timers are cleared; see
.Xr setitimer 2 .
.It
The child process' semaphore undo values are set to 0; see
.Xr semop 2 .
.It
The child process' pending signals set is empty.
.It
The child process has no memory locks; see
.Xr mlock 2
and
.Xr mlockall 2 .
.El
.Pp
In general, the child process should call
.Xr _exit 2
rather than
.Xr exit 3 .
Otherwise, any stdio buffers that exist both in the parent and child
will be flushed twice.
Similarly,
.Xr _exit 2
should be used to prevent
.Xr atexit 3
routines from being called twice (once in the parent and once in the child).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn fork
returns a value
of 0 to the child process and returns the process ID of the child
process to the parent process.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned to the parent process,
no child process is created, and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn fork
will fail and no child process will be created if:
.Bl -tag -width [EAGAIN]
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The system-imposed limits on the total
number of processes or total number of threads
under execution would be exceeded.
These limits are configuration dependent.
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The limit
.Dv RLIMIT_NPROC
on the total number of processes under execution by the user ID
would be exceeded.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
There is insufficient swap space for the new process.
.El

.Xr execve 2 ,
.Xr getrusage 2 ,
.Xr wait 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn fork
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn fork
system call first appeared in
.At v1 .
