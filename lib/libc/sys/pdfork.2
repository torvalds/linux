.Dt PDFORK 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pdfork ,
.Nm pdgetpid ,
.Nm pdkill
.Nd System calls to manage process descriptors
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/procdesc.h
.Ft pid_t
.Fn pdfork "int *fdp" "int flags"
.Ft int
.Fn pdgetpid "int fd" "pid_t *pidp"
.Ft int
.Fn pdkill "int fd" "int signum"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Process descriptors are special file descriptors that represent processes,
and are created using
.Fn pdfork ,
a variant of
.Xr fork 2 ,
which, if successful, returns a process descriptor in the integer pointed to
by
.Fa fdp .
Processes created via
.Fn pdfork
will not cause
.Dv SIGCHLD
on termination.
.Fn pdfork
can accept the flags:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv PD_DAEMON"
.It Dv PD_DAEMON
Instead of the default terminate-on-close behaviour, allow the process to
live until it is explicitly killed with
.Xr kill 2 .
.Pp
This option is not permitted in
.Xr capsicum 4
capability mode (see
.Xr cap_enter 2 ) .
.El
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv PD_DAEMON"
.It Dv PD_CLOEXEC
Set close-on-exec on process descriptor.
.El
.Pp
.Fn pdgetpid
queries the process ID (PID) in the process descriptor
.Fa fd .
.Pp
.Fn pdkill
is functionally identical to
.Xr kill 2 ,
except that it accepts a process descriptor,
.Fa fd ,
rather than a PID.
.Pp
The following system calls also have effects specific to process descriptors:
.Pp
.Xr fstat 2
queries status of a process descriptor; currently only the
.Fa st_mode ,
.Fa st_birthtime ,
.Fa st_atime ,
.Fa st_ctime
and
.Fa st_mtime
fields are defined.
If the owner read, write, and execute bits are set then the
process represented by the process descriptor is still alive.
.Pp
.Xr poll 2
and
.Xr select 2
allow waiting for process state transitions; currently only
.Dv POLLHUP
is defined, and will be raised when the process dies.
Process state transitions can also be monitored using
.Xr kqueue 2
filter
.Dv EVFILT_PROCDESC ;
currently only
.Dv NOTE_EXIT
is implemented.
.Pp
.Xr close 2
will close the process descriptor unless
.Dv PD_DAEMON
is set; if the process is still alive and this is
the last reference to the process descriptor, the process will be terminated
with the signal
.Dv SIGKILL .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn pdfork
returns a PID, 0 or -1, as
.Xr fork 2
does.
.Pp
.Fn pdgetpid
and
.Fn pdkill
return 0 on success and -1 on failure.
.Sh ERRORS
These functions may return the same error numbers as their PID-based equivalents
(e.g.
.Fn pdfork
may return the same error numbers as
.Xr fork 2 ) ,
with the following additions:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The signal number given to
.Fn pdkill
is invalid.
.It Bq Er ENOTCAPABLE
The process descriptor being operated on has insufficient rights (e.g.
.Dv CAP_PDKILL
for
.Fn pdkill ) .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn pdfork ,
.Fn pdgetpid ,
and
.Fn pdkill
system calls first appeared in
.Fx 9.0 .
.Pp
Support for process descriptors mode was developed as part of the
.Tn TrustedBSD
Project.
