.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mprotect
system call
changes the specified pages to have protection
.Fa prot .
Not all implementations will guarantee protection on a page basis;
the granularity of protection changes may be as large as an entire region.
A region is the virtual address space defined by the start
and end addresses of a
.Vt "struct vm_map_entry" .
.Pp
Currently these protection bits are known,
which can be combined, OR'd together:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv PROT_WRITE" -compact
.It Dv PROT_NONE
No permissions at all.
.It Dv PROT_READ

.Rv -std mprotect
.Sh ERRORS

and
.Fa len
arguments is not valid.
.It Bq Er EACCES
