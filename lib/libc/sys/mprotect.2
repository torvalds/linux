.Dt MPROTECT 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mprotect
.Nd control the protection of pages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/mman.h
.Ft int
.Fn mprotect "void *addr" "size_t len" "int prot"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mprotect
system call sets the access protections for the pages that contain
the address range
.Fa addr
through
.Fa addr
\&+
.Fa len
\- 1
(inclusive).
If
.Fa len
is 0, no action is taken on the page that contains
.Fa addr .
.Pp
The protections (region accessibility) are specified in the
.Fa prot
argument.
It should either be
.Dv PROT_NONE
.Pq no permissions
or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "PROT_WRITEXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Dv PROT_EXEC
Pages may be executed.
.It Dv PROT_READ
Pages may be read.
.It Dv PROT_WRITE
Pages may be written.
.El
.Pp
Not all implementations will guarantee protection on a page basis;
the granularity of protection changes may be as large as an entire region.
Nor will all implementations guarantee to give exactly the requested
permissions; more permissions may be granted than requested by
.Fa prot .
However, if
.Dv PROT_WRITE
was not specified then the page will not be writable.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn mprotect
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
The process does not have sufficient access to the underlying memory
object to provide the requested protection.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The process has locked future pages with
.Fn mlockall MCL_FUTURE ,
a page being protected is not currently accessible,
and making it accessible and locked would exceed process or system limits.
.It Bq Er ENOTSUP
The accesses requested in the
.Fa prot
argument are not allowed.
In particular,
.Dv PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC
mappings are not permitted in most binaries (see
.Dv kern.wxabort
in
.Xr sysctl 2
for more information).
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa prot
argument is invalid or the specified address range would wrap around.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The
.Fa addr
and
.Fa len
parameters
specify a region which contains at least one page marked immutable.

.Xr madvise 2 ,
.Xr mimmutable 2 ,
.Xr msync 2 ,
.Xr munmap 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn mprotect
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn mprotect
function has been available since
.Bx 4.3 Net/2 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Ox
implementation of
.Fn mprotect
does not require
.Fa addr
to be page-aligned,
although other implementations may.
