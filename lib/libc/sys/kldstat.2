.Ft int
.Fn kldstat "int fileid" "struct kld_file_stat *stat"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn kldstat
system call writes the info for the file referred to by
.Fa fileid
into
.Fa stat .
.Bd -literal
struct kld_file_stat {
	int         version;    /* set to sizeof(struct kld_file_stat) */
	char        name[MAXPATHLEN];
	int         refs;
	int         id;
	caddr_t     address;
	size_t      size;
	char        pathname[MAXPATHLEN];
};
.Ed
.Bl -tag -width XXXaddress
.It version
This field is set to the size of the structure mentioned above by the code
calling
.Fn kldstat ,
and not
.Fn kldstat
itself.
.It name
The name of the file referred to by
.Fa fileid .
.It refs
The number of modules referenced by
.Fa fileid .
.It id
The id of the file specified in
.Fa fileid .
.It address
The load address of the kld file.
.It size
The amount of memory in bytes allocated by the file.
.It pathname
The full name of the file referred to by
.Fa fileid ,
including the path.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std kldstat
.Sh ERRORS
The information for the file referred to by
.Fa fileid
is filled into the structure pointed to by
.Fa stat
unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The file was not found (probably not loaded).
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The version specified in the
.Fa version
field of stat is not the proper version.
You would need to rebuild world, the
kernel, or your application, if this error occurs, given that you did properly
fill in the
.Fa version
field.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
There was a problem copying one, some, or all of the fields into
.Fa stat
in the
.Xr copyout 9
function.

The pathname may not be accurate if the file system mounts have
changed since the module was loaded, or if this function is called
within a chrooted environment.
