.Dt MOUNT 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount ,
.Nm nmount ,
.Nm unmount
.Nd mount or dismount a file system
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/mount.h
.Ft int
.Fn mount "const char *type" "const char *dir" "int flags" "void *data"
.Ft int
.Fn unmount "const char *dir" "int flags"
.In sys/uio.h
.Ft int
.Fn nmount "struct iovec *iov" "u_int niov" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mount
system call grafts
a file system object onto the system file tree
at the point
.Fa dir .
The argument
.Fa data
describes the file system object to be mounted.
The argument
.Fa type
tells the kernel how to interpret
.Fa data
(See
.Fa type
below).
The contents of the file system
become available through the new mount point
.Fa dir .
Any files in
.Fa dir
at the time
of a successful mount are swept under the carpet so to speak, and
are unavailable until the file system is unmounted.
.Pp
The
.Fn nmount
system call behaves similarly to
.Fn mount ,
except that the mount options (file system type name, device to mount,
mount-point name, etc.) are passed as an array of name-value pairs
in the array
.Fa iov ,
containing
.Fa niov
elements.
The following options are required by all file systems:
.Bl -column fstype -offset indent
.It
.Li fstype Ta file system type name (e.g., Dq Li procfs )
.It
.Li fspath Ta mount point pathname (e.g., Dq Li /proc )
.El
.Pp
Depending on the file system type, other options may be
recognized or required;
for example, most disk-based file systems require a
.Dq Li from
option containing the pathname of a special device
in addition to the options listed above.
.Pp
By default only the super-user may call the
.Fn mount
system call.
This restriction can be removed by setting the
.Va vfs.usermount
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
to a non-zero value; see the BUGS section for more information.
.Pp
The following
.Fa flags
may be specified to
suppress default semantics which affect file system access.
.Bl -tag -width MNT_SYNCHRONOUS
.It Dv MNT_RDONLY
The file system should be treated as read-only;
even the super-user may not write on it.
Specifying MNT_UPDATE without this option will upgrade
a read-only file system to read/write.
.It Dv MNT_NOEXEC
Do not allow files to be executed from the file system.
.It Dv MNT_NOSUID
Do not honor setuid or setgid bits on files when executing them.
This flag is set automatically when the caller is not the super-user.
.It Dv MNT_NOATIME
Disable update of file access times.
.It Dv MNT_SNAPSHOT
Create a snapshot of the file system.
This is currently only supported on UFS2 file systems, see
.Xr mksnap_ffs 8
for more information.
.It Dv MNT_SUIDDIR
Directories with the SUID bit set chown new files to their own owner.
This flag requires the SUIDDIR option to have been compiled into the kernel
to have any effect.
See the
.Xr mount 8
and
.Xr chmod 2
pages for more information.
.It Dv MNT_SYNCHRONOUS
All I/O to the file system should be done synchronously.
.It Dv MNT_ASYNC
All I/O to the file system should be done asynchronously.
.It Dv MNT_FORCE
Force a read-write mount even if the file system appears to be unclean.
Dangerous.
Together with
.Dv MNT_UPDATE
and
.Dv MNT_RDONLY ,
specify that the file system is to be forcibly downgraded to a read-only
mount even if some files are open for writing.
.It Dv MNT_NOCLUSTERR
Disable read clustering.
.It Dv MNT_NOCLUSTERW
Disable write clustering.
.El
.Pp
The flag
.Dv MNT_UPDATE
indicates that the mount command is being applied
to an already mounted file system.
This allows the mount flags to be changed without requiring
that the file system be unmounted and remounted.
Some file systems may not allow all flags to be changed.
For example,
many file systems will not allow a change from read-write to read-only.
.Pp
The flag
.Dv MNT_RELOAD
causes the vfs subsystem to update its data structures pertaining to
the specified already mounted file system.
.Pp
The
.Fa type
argument names the file system.
The types of file systems known to the system can be obtained with
.Xr lsvfs 1 .
.Pp
The
.Fa data
argument
is a pointer to a structure that contains the type
specific arguments to mount.
The format for these argument structures is described in the
manual page for each file system.
By convention file system manual pages are named
by prefixing ``mount_'' to the name of the file system as returned by
.Xr lsvfs 1 .
Thus the
.Tn NFS
file system is described by the
.Xr mount_nfs 8
manual page.
It should be noted that a manual page for default
file systems, known as UFS and UFS2, does not exist.
.Pp
The
.Fn unmount
system call disassociates the file system from the specified
mount point
.Fa dir .
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument may include
.Dv MNT_FORCE
to specify that the file system should be forcibly unmounted
even if files are still active.
Active special devices continue to work,
but any further accesses to any other active files result in errors
even if the file system is later remounted.
.Pp
If the
.Dv MNT_BYFSID
flag is specified,
.Fa dir
should instead be a file system ID encoded as
.Dq Li FSID : Ns Ar val0 : Ns Ar val1 ,
where
.Ar val0
and
.Ar val1
are the contents of the
.Vt fsid_t
.Va val[]
array in decimal.
The file system that has the specified file system ID will be unmounted.
.Sh RETURN VALUES

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn mount
and
.Fn unmount
functions appeared in
.At v1 .
The
.Fn nmount
system call first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 .
.Sh BUGS
Some of the error codes need translation to more obvious messages.
.Pp
Allowing untrusted users to mount arbitrary media, e.g. by enabling
.Va vfs.usermount ,
should not be considered safe.
Most file systems in
.Fx
were not built to safeguard against malicious devices.
