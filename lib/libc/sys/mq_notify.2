.Dt MQ_NOTIFY 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mq_notify
.Nd "notify process that a message is available (REALTIME)"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb librt
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In mqueue.h
.Ft int
.Fn mq_notify "mqd_t mqdes" "const struct sigevent *notification"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
If the argument notification is not
.Dv NULL ,
this system call will register the calling process to be notified of message
arrival at an empty message queue associated with the specified message
queue descriptor,
.Fa mqdes .
The notification specified by the
.Fa notification
argument will be sent to
the process when the message queue transitions from empty to non-empty.
At any time, only one process may be registered for notification by a
message queue.
If the calling process or any other process has already
registered for notification of message arrival at the specified message
queue, subsequent attempts to register for that message queue will fail.
.Pp
The
.Fa notification
argument points to a
.Vt sigevent
structure that defines how the calling process will be notified.
If
.Fa notification->sigev_notify
is
.Dv SIGEV_NONE ,
then no signal will be posted, but the error status and the return status
for the operation will be set appropriately.
For
.Dv SIGEV_SIGNO
and
.Dv SIGEV_THREAD_ID
notifications,
the signal specified in
.Fa notification->sigev_signo
will be sent to the calling process
.Pq Dv SIGEV_SIGNO
or to the thread whose LWP ID is
.Fa notification->sigev_notify_thread_id
.Pq Dv SIGEV_THREAD_ID .
The information for the queued signal will include:
.Bl -column ".Va si_value"
.It Sy Member Ta Sy Value
.It Va si_code Ta Dv SI_MESGQ
.It Va si_value Ta
the value stored in
.Fa notification->sigev_value
.It Va si_mqd Ta Fa mqdes
.El
.Pp
If
.Fa notification
is
.Dv NULL
and the process is currently registered for notification by the specified
message queue, the existing registration will be removed.
.Pp
When the notification is sent to the registered process, its registration
is removed.
The message queue then is available for registration.
.Pp
If a process has registered for notification of message arrival at a
message queue and some thread is blocked in
.Fn mq_receive
waiting to receive a message when a message arrives at the queue, the
arriving message will satisfy the appropriate
.Fn mq_receive .
The resulting behavior is as if the message queue remains empty, and no
notification will be sent.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn mq_notify
system call
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa mqdes
argument is not a valid message queue descriptor.
.It Bq Er EBUSY
Process is already registered for notification by the message queue.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The asynchronous notification method in
.Fa notification->sigev_notify
is invalid or not supported.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn mq_notify
system call conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2004 .

message queues first appeared in
