.Sh NAME
.Nm stat ,
.Nm lstat ,
.Nm fstat ,
.Nm fstatat
.Nd get file status
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/stat.h
.Ft int
.Fn stat "const char * restrict path" "struct stat * restrict sb"
.Ft int
.Fn lstat "const char * restrict path" "struct stat * restrict sb"
.Ft int
.Fn fstat "int fd" "struct stat *sb"
.Ft int
.Fn fstatat "int fd" "const char *path" "struct stat *sb" "int flag"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn stat
system call obtains information about the file pointed to by
.Fa path .
Read, write or execute
permission of the named file is not required, but all directories
listed in the path name leading to the file must be searchable.
.Pp
The
.Fn lstat
system call is like
.Fn stat
except when the named file is a symbolic link,
in which case
.Fn lstat
returns information about the link,
while
.Fn stat
returns information about the file the link references.
.Pp
The
.Fn fstat
system call obtains the same information about an open file
known by the file descriptor
.Fa fd .
.Pp
The
.Fn fstatat
system call is equivalent to
.Fn stat
and
.Fn lstat
except when the
.Fa path
specifies a relative path, or the
.Dv AT_BENEATH
flag is provided.
For
.Fn fstatat
and relative
.Fa path ,
the status is retrieved from a file relative to
the directory associated with the file descriptor
.Fa fd
instead of the current working directory.
For
.Dv AT_BENEATH
and absolute
.Fa path ,
the status is retrieved from a file specified by the
.Fa path ,
but additional permission checks are performed, see below.
.Pp
The values for the
.Fa flag
are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from this list,
defined in
.In fcntl.h :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
If
.Fa path
names a symbolic link, the status of the symbolic link is returned.
.It Dv AT_BENEATH
Only stat files and directories below the topping directory.
See the description of the
.Dv O_BENEATH
flag in the
.Xr open 2
manual page.
.El
.Pp
If
.Fn fstatat
is passed the special value
.Dv AT_FDCWD
in the
.Fa fd
parameter, the current working directory is used and the behavior is
identical to a call to
.Fn stat
or
.Fn lstat
respectively, depending on whether or not the
.Dv AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
bit is set in
.Fa flag .
.Pp
When
.Fn fstatat
is called with an absolute
.Fa path
without the
.Dv AT_BENEATH
flag, it ignores the
.Fa fd
argument.
When
.Dv AT_BENEATH
is specified with an absolute
.Fa path ,
a directory passed by the
.Fa fd
argument is used as the topping point for the resolution.
.Pp
The
.Fa sb
argument is a pointer to a
.Vt stat
structure
as defined by
.In sys/stat.h
and into which information is placed concerning the file.
.Pp
The fields of
.Vt "struct stat"
related to the file system are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va st_nlink"
.It Va st_dev
Numeric ID of the device containing the file.
.It Va st_ino
The file's inode number.
.It Va st_nlink
Number of hard links to the file.
.It Va st_flags
Flags enabled for the file.
See
.Xr chflags 2
for the list of flags and their description.
.El
.Pp
The
.Va st_dev
and
.Va st_ino
fields together identify the file uniquely within the system.
.Pp
The time-related fields of
.Vt "struct stat"
are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va st_birthtim"
.It Va st_atim
Time when file data was last accessed.
Changed implicitly by syscalls such as
.Xr read 2
and
.Xr readv 2 ,
and explicitly by
.Xr utimes 2 .
.It Va st_mtim
Time when file data was last modified.
Changed implicitly by syscalls such as
.Xr truncate 2 ,
.Xr write 2 ,
and
.Xr writev 2 ,
and explicitly by
.Xr utimes 2 .
Also, any syscall which modifies directory content changes the
.Va st_mtim
for the affected directory.
For instance,
.Xr creat 2 ,
.Xr mkdir 2 ,
.Xr rename 2 ,
.Xr link 2 ,
and
.Xr unlink 2 .
.It Va st_ctim
Time when file status was last changed (inode data modification).
Changed implicitly by any syscall that affects file metadata, including
.Va st_mtim ,
such as
.Xr chflags 2 ,
.Xr chmod 2 ,
.Xr chown 2 ,
.Xr truncate 2 ,
.Xr utimes 2 ,
and
.Xr write 2 .
Also, any syscall which modifies directory content changes the
.Va st_ctim
for the affected directory.
For instance,
.Xr creat 2 ,
.Xr mkdir 2 ,
.Xr rename 2 ,
.Xr link 2 ,
and
.Xr unlink 2 .
.It Va st_birthtim
Time when the inode was created.
.El
.Pp
These time-related macros are defined for compatibility:
.Bd -literal

#define	st_mtime		st_mtim.tv_sec
#define	st_ctime		st_ctim.tv_sec
#ifndef _POSIX_SOURCE

#define	st_ctimespec		st_ctim
#define	st_birthtimespec	st_birthtim
#endif
.Ed
.Pp
Size-related fields of the
.Vt "struct stat"
are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va st_blksize"
.It Va st_size
File size in bytes.
.It Va st_blksize
Optimal I/O block size for the file.
.It Va st_blocks
Actual number of blocks allocated for the file in 512-byte units.
As short symbolic links are stored in the inode, this number may
be zero.
.El
.Pp
The access-related fields of
.Vt "struct stat"
are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va st_mode"
.It Va st_uid
User ID of the file's owner.
.It Va st_gid
Group ID of the file.
.It Va st_mode
Status of the file (see below).
.El
.Pp
The status information word
.Fa st_mode
has these bits:
.Bd -literal

.Pp
For a list of access modes, see
.In sys/stat.h ,
.Xr access 2
and
.Xr chmod 2 .
These macros are available to test whether a
.Va st_mode
value passed in the
.Fa m
argument corresponds to a file of the specified type:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fn S_ISFIFO m"
.It Fn S_ISBLK m
Test for a block special file.
.It Fn S_ISCHR m
Test for a character special file.
.It Fn S_ISDIR m
Test for a directory.
.It Fn S_ISFIFO m
Test for a pipe or FIFO special file.
.It Fn S_ISLNK m
Test for a symbolic link.
.It Fn S_ISREG m
Test for a regular file.
.It Fn S_ISSOCK m
Test for a socket.
.It Fn S_ISWHT m
Test for a whiteout.
.El
.Pp
The macros evaluate to a non-zero value if the test is true
or to the value 0 if the test is false.
