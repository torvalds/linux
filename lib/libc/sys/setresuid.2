Privileged processes may set these IDs to arbitrary values.
Unprivileged processes are restricted
in that each of the new IDs must match one of the current IDs.

Passing \-1 as an argument causes the corresponding value
to remain unchanged.

.Fn getresuid
calls retrieve the real, effective, and saved group and user IDs of
the current process, respectively.
