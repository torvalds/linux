.Sh NAME
.Nm ypconnect
.Nd create connected socket to a YP server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/socket.h
.Ft int
.Fn ypconnect "int type"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ypconnect
system call creates a pre-connected
.Va SOCK_STREAM
or
.Va SOCK_DGRAM
socket to a YP server (either the original
.Xr ypserv 8
or
.Xr ypldap 8 )
for use by internal library routines.
It verifies that the domainname is set, that
.Xr ypbind 8
has found a server and created an advisory locked binding file,
and then creates the connected socket based upon the binding file.
This type of socket is restricted in various ways and is not
general purpose.
.Nm
is only intended for use by internal libc YP functions.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
.Fn ypconnect
returns a non-negative integer, the socket file descriptor.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn ypconnect
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EAFNOSUPPORT
The YP subsystem is not active.
.It Bq Er EFTYPE
The YP binding file is strange.
.It Bq Er EOWNERDEAD

YP subsystem is not active.
.It Bq Er EMFILE
The per-process descriptor table is full.
.It Bq Er ENFILE
