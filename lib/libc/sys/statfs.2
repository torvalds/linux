.Sh NAME
.Nm statfs
.Nd get file system statistics
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/mount.h
.Ft int
.Fn statfs "const char *path" "struct statfs *buf"
.Ft int
.Fn fstatfs "int fd" "struct statfs *buf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn statfs
system call
returns information about a mounted file system.
The
.Fa path
argument
is the path name of any file within the mounted file system.
The
.Fa buf
argument
is a pointer to a
.Vt statfs
structure defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct fsid { int32_t val[2]; } fsid_t; /* file system id type */

/*
 * filesystem statistics
 */

#define	MFSNAMELEN	16		/* length of type name including null */
#define	MNAMELEN	1024		/* size of on/from name bufs */
#define	STATFS_VERSION	0x20140518	/* current version number */

struct statfs {
uint32_t f_version;		/* structure version number */
uint32_t f_type;		/* type of filesystem */
uint64_t f_flags;		/* copy of mount exported flags */
uint64_t f_bsize;		/* filesystem fragment size */
uint64_t f_iosize;		/* optimal transfer block size */
uint64_t f_blocks;		/* total data blocks in filesystem */
uint64_t f_bfree;		/* free blocks in filesystem */
int64_t	 f_bavail;		/* free blocks avail to non-superuser */
uint64_t f_files;		/* total file nodes in filesystem */
int64_t	 f_ffree;		/* free nodes avail to non-superuser */
uint64_t f_syncwrites;		/* count of sync writes since mount */
uint64_t f_asyncwrites;		/* count of async writes since mount */
uint64_t f_syncreads;		/* count of sync reads since mount */
uint64_t f_asyncreads;		/* count of async reads since mount */
uint64_t f_spare[10];		/* unused spare */
uint32_t f_namemax;		/* maximum filename length */
uid_t	  f_owner;		/* user that mounted the filesystem */
fsid_t	  f_fsid;		/* filesystem id */
char	  f_charspare[80];	    /* spare string space */
char	  f_fstypename[MFSNAMELEN]; /* filesystem type name */
char	  f_mntfromname[MNAMELEN];  /* mounted filesystem */
char	  f_mntonname[MNAMELEN];    /* directory on which mounted */
