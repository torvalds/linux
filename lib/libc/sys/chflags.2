.Nm lchflags ,
.Nm fchflags ,
.Nm chflagsat
.Nd set file flags
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/stat.h
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn chflags "const char *path" "unsigned long flags"
.Ft int
.Fn lchflags "const char *path" "unsigned long flags"
.Ft int
.Fn fchflags "int fd" "unsigned long flags"
.Ft int
.Fn chflagsat "int fd" "const char *path" "unsigned long flags" "int atflag"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file whose name
is given by
.Fa path
or referenced by the descriptor
.Fa fd
has its flags changed to
.Fa flags .
.Pp
The
.Fn lchflags
system call is like
.Fn chflags
except in the case where the named file is a symbolic link,
in which case
.Fn lchflags
will change the flags of the link itself,
rather than the file it points to.
.Pp
The
.Fn chflagsat
is equivalent to either
.Fn chflags
or
.Fn lchflags
depending on the
.Fa atflag
except in the case where
.Fa path
specifies a relative path.
In this case the file to be changed is determined relative to the directory
associated with the file descriptor
.Fa fd
instead of the current working directory.
The values for the
.Fa atflag
are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from the following list,
defined in
.In fcntl.h :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
If
.Fa path
names a symbolic link, then the flags of the symbolic link are changed.
.It Dv AT_BENEATH
Only allow to change flags for a file which is beneath of
the topping directory.
See the description of the
.Dv O_BENEATH
flag in the
.Xr open 2
manual page.
.El
.Pp
If
.Fn chflagsat
is passed the special value
.Dv AT_FDCWD
in the
.Fa fd
parameter, the current working directory is used.
If also
.Fa atflag
is zero, the behavior is identical to a call to
.Fn chflags .
.Pp
The flags specified are formed by
.Em or Ns 'ing
the following values
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv SF_IMMUTABLE" -compact -offset indent
.It Dv SF_APPEND
The file may only be appended to.
.It Dv SF_ARCHIVED
The file has been archived.
This flag means the opposite of the DOS, Windows and CIFS
FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE attribute.
This flag has been deprecated, and may be removed in a future release.
.It Dv SF_IMMUTABLE
The file may not be changed.
.It Dv SF_NOUNLINK
The file may not be renamed or deleted.
.It Dv SF_SNAPSHOT
The file is a snapshot file.
.It Dv UF_APPEND
The file may only be appended to.
.It Dv UF_ARCHIVE
The file needs to be archived.
This flag has the same meaning as the DOS, Windows and CIFS
FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE attribute.
Filesystems in FreeBSD may or may not have special handling for this flag.
For instance, ZFS tracks changes to files and will set this bit when a
file is updated.
UFS only stores the flag, and relies on the application to change it when
needed.
.It Dv UF_HIDDEN
The file may be hidden from directory listings at the application's
discretion.
The file has the DOS, Windows and CIFS FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN attribute.
.It Dv UF_IMMUTABLE
The file may not be changed.
.It Dv UF_NODUMP
Do not dump the file.
.It Dv UF_NOUNLINK
The file may not be renamed or deleted.
.It Dv UF_OFFLINE
The file is offline, or has the Windows and CIFS FILE_ATTRIBUTE_OFFLINE
attribute.
Filesystems in FreeBSD store and display this flag, but do not provide any
special handling when it is set.
.It Dv UF_OPAQUE
The directory is opaque when viewed through a union stack.
.It Dv UF_READONLY
The file is read only, and may not be written or appended.
Filesystems may use this flag to maintain compatibility with the DOS, Windows
and CIFS FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY attribute.
.It Dv UF_REPARSE
The file contains a Windows reparse point and has the Windows and CIFS
FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT attribute.
.It Dv UF_SPARSE
The file has the Windows FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SPARSE_FILE attribute.
This may also be used by a filesystem to indicate a sparse file.
.It Dv UF_SYSTEM
The file has the DOS, Windows and CIFS FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM attribute.
Filesystems in FreeBSD may store and display this flag, but do not provide
any special handling when it is set.
.El
.Pp
If one of
.Dv SF_IMMUTABLE , SF_APPEND ,
or
.Dv SF_NOUNLINK
is set a non-super-user cannot change any flags and even the super-user
can change flags only if securelevel is 0.
(See
.Xr init 8
for details.)
.Pp
The
.Dv UF_IMMUTABLE , UF_APPEND , UF_NOUNLINK , UF_NODUMP ,
and
.Dv UF_OPAQUE
flags may be set or unset by either the owner of a file or the super-user.
.Pp
The
.Dv SF_IMMUTABLE , SF_APPEND , SF_NOUNLINK ,
and
.Dv SF_ARCHIVED
flags may only be set or unset by the super-user.
Attempts to toggle these flags by non-super-users are rejected.
These flags may be set at any time, but normally may only be unset when
the system is in single-user mode.
(See
.Xr init 8
for details.)
.Pp
The implementation of all flags is filesystem-dependent.
See the description of the
.Dv UF_ARCHIVE
flag above for one example of the differences in behavior.
Care should be exercised when writing applications to account for
support or lack of support of these flags in various filesystems.
.Pp
The
.Dv SF_SNAPSHOT
flag is maintained by the system and cannot be toggled.
