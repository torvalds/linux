.Dt GETTHRNAME 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getthrname ,
.Nm setthrname
.Nd get or set thread name
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fo getthrname
.Fa "pid_t tid"
.Fa "char *name"
.Fa "size_t namelen"
.Fc
.Ft int
.Fo setthrname
.Fa "pid_t tid"
.Fa "const char *name"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getthrname
system call stores the name of
.Fa tid ,
a thread in the current process,
into the buffer
.Fa name ,
which must be of at least
.Fa namelen
bytes long.
The buffer should be large enough to store the thread name and a
trailing NUL
(typically
.Dv MAXCOMLEN+1
bytes).
The
.Fn setthrname
system call sets the name of
.Fa tid
to the supplied
.Fa name .
For both functions, if
.Fa tid
is zero then the current thread is operated on.
.Pp
Thread names have no inherent meaning in the system and are
intended for display and debugging only.
They are not secret but rather are visible to other processes using
.Xr sysctl 2
or
.Xr kvm_getprocs 3
and in
.Ic ps Fl H
output.
.Pp
After
.Xr execve 2 ,
the name of the process's only thread is reset to the empty string.
Similarly, additional threads created with
.Xr __tfork 3
start with the empty name.
After
.Xr fork 2 ,
the new process's only thread has the same name as the thread that
invoked
.Xr fork 2 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the value 0 is returned;
otherwise the error number is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn getthrname
and
.Fn setthrname
will succeed unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa name
argument points to an
invalid address.
.El
.Pp
In addition,
.Fn getthrname
may return the following error:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ERANGE
The value of
.Fa namelen
is not large enough to store the thread name and a trailing NUL.
.El
.Pp
.Fn setthrname
may return the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa name
argument
pointed to a string that was too long.
Thread names are limited to
.Dv MAXCOMLEN
characters, currently 23.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr execve 2 ,
.Xr fork 2 ,
.Xr sysctl 2 ,
.Xr __tfork 3 ,
.Xr kvm_getprocs 3 ,
.Xr pthread_set_name_np 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn getthrname
and
.Fn setthrname
system calls are specific to
.Ox ;
.Xr pthread_get_name_np 3
and
.Xr pthread_set_name_np 3
operate on the same thread name in a more portable way.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getthrname
and
.Fn setthrname
system calls first appeared in
.Ox 7.3 .
