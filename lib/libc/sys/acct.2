.Dt ACCT 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm acct
.Nd enable or disable process accounting
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn acct "const char *file"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acct
call enables or disables the collection of system accounting records.
If
.Fa file
is
.Dv NULL ,
accounting is disabled.
If
.Fa file
is an existing, NUL-terminated pathname, record collection is enabled.
For every process initiated which terminates under normal conditions or
misbehaves in very specific ways (e.g. file access prevented by unveil),
an accounting record is appended to
.Fa file .
Abnormal conditions of termination are reboots or other
fatal system problems.
.Fn acct
is only available on kernels compiled with the
.Cm ACCOUNTING
option.
.Pp
For more information on the record structure used by
.Fn acct ,
see
.Pa /usr/include/sys/acct.h
and
.Xr acct 5 .
.Pp
This call is permitted only to the superuser.
.Sh NOTES
Accounting is automatically disabled when the file system the
accounting file resides on runs out of space; it is enabled when
space once again becomes available.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn acct
will fail if one of the following is true:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EPERM

.It Bq Er ENOTDIR

.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG

exceeded
.Dv PATH_MAX
bytes.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named file does not exist.
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix,
or the pathname is not a regular file.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.It Bq Er EROFS
The named file resides on a read-only file system.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
