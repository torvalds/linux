.Nd access file via file handle
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/stat.h
.Ft int
.Fn fhopen "const fhandle_t *fhp" "int flags"
.Ft int
.Fn fhstat "const fhandle_t *fhp" "struct stat *sb"

.Fn fhstatfs "const fhandle_t *fhp" "struct statfs *buf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide a means to access a file given the file handle
.Fa fhp .
As this method bypasses directory access restrictions, these calls are
restricted to the superuser.
.Pp
.Fn fhopen
opens the file referenced by
.Fa fhp
for reading and/or writing as specified by the argument
.Fa flags
and returns the file descriptor to the calling process.
The
.Fa flags
are specified by
.Em or Ns 'ing
together the flags used for the
.Xr open 2
call.
All said flags are valid except for
.Dv O_CREAT .
.Pp
.Fn fhstat
and
.Fn fhstatfs
provide the functionality of the
.Xr fstat 2
and
.Xr fstatfs 2
calls except that they return information for the file referred to by
.Fa fhp
rather than an open file.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn fhopen
returns the file descriptor for the opened file, while
.Fn fhstat
and
.Fn fhstatfs
return 0.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
In addition to the errors returned by
.Xr open 2 ,
.Xr fstat 2 ,
and
.Xr fstatfs 2
respectively,
.Fn fhopen ,
.Fn fhstat ,
and
.Fn fhstatfs
will return
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Calling
.Fn fhopen
with
