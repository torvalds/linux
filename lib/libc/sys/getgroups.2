.Sh NAME
.Nm getgroups
.Nd get group access list
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn getgroups "int gidsetlen" "gid_t *gidset"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getgroups
system call
gets the current group access list of the user process
and stores it in the array
.Fa gidset .
The
.Fa gidsetlen
argument
indicates the number of entries that may be placed in
.Fa gidset .
The
.Fn getgroups
system call
returns the actual number of groups returned in
.Fa gidset .
At least one and as many as {NGROUPS_MAX}+1 values may be returned.
If
.Fa gidsetlen
is zero,
.Fn getgroups
returns the number of supplementary group IDs associated with
the calling process without modifying the array pointed to by
.Fa gidset .
.Pp
The value of
.Dv {NGROUPS_MAX}
should be obtained using
.Xr sysconf 3
to avoid hard-coding it into the executable.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
A successful call returns the number of groups in the group set.
A value of -1 indicates that an error occurred, and the error
code is stored in the global variable
.Va errno .
