.Dt PSELECT 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pselect
.Nd synchronous I/O multiplexing a la POSIX.1g
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/select.h
.Ft int
.Fo pselect
.Fa "int nfds"
.Fa "fd_set * restrict readfds"
.Fa "fd_set * restrict writefds"
.Fa "fd_set * restrict exceptfds"
.Fa "const struct timespec * restrict timeout"
.Fa "const sigset_t * restrict newsigmask"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pselect
function was introduced by
.St -p1003.1g-2000
as a slightly stronger version of
.Xr select 2 .
The
.Fa nfds , readfds , writefds ,
and
.Fa exceptfds
arguments are all identical to the analogous arguments of
.Fn select .
The
.Fa timeout
argument in
.Fn pselect
points to a
.Vt "const struct timespec"
rather than the (modifiable)
.Vt "struct timeval"
used by
.Fn select ;
as in
.Fn select ,
a null pointer may be passed to indicate that
.Fn pselect
should wait indefinitely.
Finally,
.Fa newsigmask
specifies a signal mask which is set while waiting for input.
When
.Fn pselect
returns, the original signal mask is restored.
.Pp
See
.Xr select 2
for a more detailed discussion of the semantics of this interface, and
for macros used to manipulate the
.Vt "fd_set"
data type.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn pselect
function returns the same values and under the same conditions as
.Fn select .
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn pselect
function may fail for any of the reasons documented for
.Xr select 2
and (if a signal mask is provided)
.Xr sigprocmask 2 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kqueue 2 ,
.Xr poll 2 ,
.Xr select 2 ,
.Xr sigprocmask 2 ,
.Xr sigsuspend 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn pselect
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn pselect
function first appeared in
.Fx 5.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The first implementation of
.Fn pselect
function and this manual page were written by
.An Garrett Wollman Aq Mt wollman@FreeBSD.org .
