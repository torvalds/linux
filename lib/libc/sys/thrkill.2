to
.Fa tid ,
a thread in the same process as the caller.
.Fn thrkill
will only succeed if

is either
.Dv NULL
or the address of the thread control block (TCB) of the target thread.
.Fa sig
may be one of the signals specified in
.Xr sigaction 2
or it may be 0, in which case
error checking is performed but no
signal is actually sent.

If
.Fa tid
is zero then the current thread is targeted.
