.Dt AIO_FSYNC 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm aio_fsync
.Nd asynchronous file synchronization (REALTIME)
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In aio.h
.Ft int
.Fn aio_fsync "int op" "struct aiocb *iocb"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn aio_fsync
system call allows the calling process to move all modified data
associated with the descriptor
.Fa iocb->aio_fildes
to a permanent storage device.
The call returns immediately after the synchronization request has been
enqueued to the descriptor; the synchronization may or may not have
completed at the time the call returns.
.Pp
The
.Fa op
argument can only be set to
.Dv O_SYNC
to cause all currently queued I/O operations to be completed
as if by a call to
.Xr fsync 2 .
.Pp
If _POSIX_PRIORITIZED_IO is defined, and the descriptor supports it,
then the enqueued operation is submitted at a priority equal to that
of the calling process minus
.Fa iocb->aio_reqprio .
.Pp
The
.Fa iocb
pointer may be subsequently used as an argument to
.Fn aio_return
and
.Fn aio_error
in order to determine return or error status for the enqueued operation
while it is in progress.
.Pp
If the request could not be enqueued (generally due to invalid arguments),
the call returns without having enqueued the request.
.Pp
The
.Fa iocb->aio_sigevent
structure can be used to request notification of the operation's
completion as described in
.Xr aio 4 .
.Sh RESTRICTIONS
The Asynchronous I/O Control Block structure pointed to by
.Fa iocb
must remain valid until the
operation has completed.
.Pp
The asynchronous I/O control buffer
.Fa iocb
should be zeroed before the
.Fn aio_fsync
call to avoid passing bogus context information to the kernel.
.Pp
Modification of the Asynchronous I/O Control Block structure is not allowed
while the request is queued.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std aio_fsync
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn aio_fsync
system call will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The request was not queued because of system resource limitations.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The asynchronous notification method in
.Fa iocb->aio_sigevent.sigev_notify
is invalid or not supported.
.It Bq Er EOPNOTSUPP
Asynchronous file synchronization operations on the file descriptor
.Fa iocb->aio_fildes
are unsafe and unsafe asynchronous I/O operations are disabled.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
A value of the
.Fa op
argument is not set to
.Dv O_SYNC .
.El
.Pp
The following conditions may be synchronously detected when the
.Fn aio_fsync
system call is made, or asynchronously, at any time thereafter.
If they are detected at call time,
.Fn aio_fsync
returns -1 and sets
.Va errno
appropriately; otherwise the
.Fn aio_return
system call must be called, and will return -1, and
.Fn aio_error
must be called to determine the actual value that would have been
returned in
.Va errno .
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa iocb->aio_fildes
argument
is not a valid descriptor.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
This implementation does not support synchronized I/O for this file.
.El
.Pp
If the request is successfully enqueued, but subsequently cancelled
or an error occurs, the value returned by the
.Fn aio_return
system call is per the
.Xr read 2
and
.Xr write 2
system calls, and the value returned by the
.Fn aio_error
system call is one of the error returns from the
.Xr read 2
or
.Xr write 2
system calls.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn aio_fsync
system call is expected to conform to the
.St -p1003.1
standard.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn aio_fsync
system call first appeared in
.Fx 7.0 .
