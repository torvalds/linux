.Sh NAME
.Nm waitid
.Nd wait for process state change
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/wait.h
.Ft int
.Fn waitid "idtype_t idtype" "id_t id" "siginfo_t *infop" "int options"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn waitid
function suspends execution of its calling process until
a selected state change occurs for a matching child process,
or a signal is received.
.Pp
The set of child processes to be queried is specified by the arguments
.Fa idtype
and
.Fa id .
.Bl -dash -offset indent
.It
If
.Fa idtype
is
.Dv P_PID ,
.Fn waitid
waits for the child process with a process ID equal to
.Dv (pid_t)id .
.It
If
.Fa idtype
is
.Dv P_PGID ,
.Fn waitid
waits for the child process with a process group ID equal to
.Dv (pid_t)id .
.It
If
.Fa idtype
is
.Dv P_ALL ,
.Fn waitid
waits for any child process and the
.Dv id
is ignored.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa options
argument is the bitwise OR of zero or more of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width "WCONTINUED"
.It Dv WCONTINUED
Causes status to be reported for selected child processes that were
previously stopped and which have been continued by receipt of a
.Dv SIGCONT
signal.
.It Dv WEXITED
Reports the status of selected processes which have terminated.
.It Dv WNOHANG
Indicates that the call should not block if there are no selected processes
that have a status change to report.
.It Dv WNOWAIT
Keeps the process whose status is returned in a waitable state.
The process may be waited for again after this call completes.
.It Dv WSTOPPED
Reports the status of selected processes which are stopped due to a
.Dv SIGTTIN , SIGTTOU , SIGTSTP ,
or
.Dv SIGSTOP
signal.
.It Dv WTRAPPED
Reports the status of selected processes which are stopped due to a
process tracing event
.Xr ( ptrace 2 ) .
.El
.Pp
At least one of
.Dv WCONTINUED , WEXITED , WSTOPPED ,
or
.Dv WTRAPPED
must be specified.
.Pp
If
.Fn waitid
found a matching process, the structure referenced by
.Fa infop
is filled with the status of the process:
.Fa si_signo
is set to
.Dv SIGCHLD ,
and
.Fa si_pid
and
.Fa si_uid
are set to the process ID and effective user ID of the matched process.
.Fa si_code
will be set to one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width "CLD_CONTINUED"
.It Dv CLD_CONTINUED
The process was previously stopped and was continued.
.Fa si_status
will be set to
.Dv SIGCONT .
Only returned if
.Fa options
includes
.Dv WCONTINUED .
.It Dv CLD_DUMPED
The process was killed by a signal and a core file was generated.
.Fa si_status
will be set to the signal that killed the process.
Only returned if
.Fa options
includes
.Dv WEXITED .
.It Dv CLD_EXITED
The process exited normally.
.Fa si_status
will be set to the full
.Ft int
value that was passed to
.Xr _exit 2 .
Only returned if
.Fa options
includes
.Dv WEXITED .
.It Dv CLD_KILLED
The process was killed by a signal with generation of a core file.
.Fa si_status
will be set to the signal that killed the process.
Only returned if
.Fa options
includes
.Dv WEXITED .
.It Dv CLD_STOPPED
The process was stopped due to a signal.
.Fa si_status
will be set to the signal that stopped the process.
Only returned if
.Fa options
includes
.Dv WSTOPPED .
.It Dv CLD_TRAPPED
The process was stopped due to process tracing
.Xr ( ptrace 2 ) .
.Fa si_status
will be set to the signal that caused the trap.
Only returned if
.Fa options
includes
.Dv WTRAPPED .
.El
.Pp
If
.Dv WNOHANG
was specified and
.Fn waitid
didn't find a matching process,
.Fa si_signo
and
.Fa si_pid
will be set to zero.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If
.Fn waitid
returns because one or more processes have a state change to report,
0 is returned.
If an error is detected,
a value of -1
is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
If
.Dv WNOHANG
is specified and there are
no stopped, continued or exited children,
0 is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn waitid
will fail and return immediately if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ECHILD
The calling process has no existing unwaited-for child processes.
.It Bq Er ECHILD
No status from the terminated child process is available
because the calling process has asked the system to discard
such status by ignoring the signal
.Dv SIGCHLD
or setting the flag
.Dv SA_NOCLDWAIT
for that signal.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa infop
argument points to an illegal address.
(May not be detected before exit of a child process.)
.It Bq Er EINTR
The call was interrupted by a caught signal, or the signal did not have the
.Dv SA_RESTART
flag set.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Invalid or undefined flags were passed in the
.Fa options
argument, or
.Fa idtype
and
.Fa id
specified an invalid set of processes.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn waitid
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
The
.Dv WTRAPPED
macro is an extension to that specification.
