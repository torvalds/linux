.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm socketpair
.Nd create a pair of connected sockets
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/socket.h
.Ft int
.Fn socketpair "int domain" "int type" "int protocol" "int sv[2]"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn socketpair
call creates an unnamed pair of connected sockets.
The descriptors used in referencing the new sockets
are returned in
.Fa sv Ns [0]
and
.Fa sv Ns [1] .
The two sockets are indistinguishable.
.Pp
The only supported
.Fa domain
is
.Dv AF_UNIX .
Possible values for the
.Fa type
and
.Fa protocol
arguments are explained in the
.Xr socket 2
manual page.
The only useful value for
.Fa protocol
is 0, which will let the system select an appropriate protocol
for the requested socket
.Fa type .
.Pp
Any combination of the following flags may additionally be used in the
.Fa type
argument:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "SOCK_NONBLOCKX" -offset indent -compact
.It SOCK_CLOEXEC
Set close-on-exec flag on both the new descriptors.
.It SOCK_CLOFORK
Set close-on-fork flag on both the new descriptors.
.It SOCK_NONBLOCK
Set non-blocking I/O mode on both the new sockets.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
The call succeeds unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EAFNOSUPPORT
The specified address family is not supported on this machine.
.It Bq Er EPROTONOSUPPORT
The specified protocol is not supported on this machine.
.It Bq Er EOPNOTSUPP
The specified protocol does not support creation of socket pairs.
.It Bq Er EPROTOTYPE
The combination of the specified protocol and type is not supported.
.It Bq Er EMFILE
The per-process descriptor table is full.
.It Bq Er ENFILE
The system file table is full.
.It Bq Er ENOBUFS
Insufficient resources were available in the system
to perform the operation.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The address
.Fa sv
does not specify a valid part of the
process address space.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn socketpair
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2024 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn socketpair
function call appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
Support for the
.Dv SOCK_CLOEXEC
and
.Dv SOCK_NONBLOCK
flags appeared in
.Ox 5.7 .
