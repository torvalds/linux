.Dt CONNECTAT 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm connectat
.Nd initiate a connection on a socket
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/socket.h
.Pp
.In fcntl.h
.Ft int
.Fn connectat "int fd" "int s" "const struct sockaddr *name" "socklen_t namelen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn connectat
system call initiates a connection on a socket.
When passed the special value
.Dv AT_FDCWD
in the
.Fa fd
parameter, the behavior is identical to a call to
.Xr connect 2 .
Otherwise,
.Fn connectat
works like the
.Xr connect 2
system call with two exceptions:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -offset indent -compact
.It
It is limited to sockets in the PF_LOCAL domain.
.Pp
.It
If the file path stored in the
.Fa sun_path
field of the sockaddr_un structure is a relative path, it is located relative
to the directory associated with the file descriptor
.Fa fd .
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std connectat
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn connectat
system call may fail with the same errors as the
.Xr connect 2
system call or with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa sun_path
field does not specify an absolute path and the
.Fa fd
argument is neither
.Dv AT_FDCWD
nor a valid file descriptor.
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
The
.Fa sun_path
field is not an absolute path and
.Fa fd
is neither
.Dv AT_FDCWD
nor a file descriptor associated with a directory.
