.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn sctp_generic_sendmsg
and
.Fn sctp_generic_sendmsg_iov
are the true system calls used by the
.Xr sctp_sendmsg 3
and
.Xr sctp_send 3
function calls.
These are more efficient since they are
true system calls but they are specific to
.Fx
and can be expected
.Em not
to be present on any other operating
system.
For detailed usage please see either the
.Xr sctp_send 3
or
.Xr sctp_sendmsg 3
function calls.
