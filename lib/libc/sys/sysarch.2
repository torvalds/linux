.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sysarch
.Nd architecture-dependent system call
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In machine/sysarch.h
.Ft int
.Fn sysarch "int number" "void *args"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sysarch
system call
performs the architecture-dependent function
specified by
.Fa number
with the arguments specified by the
.Fa args
pointer.
The
.Fa args
argument
is a pointer to a structure defining the actual
arguments of the function.
Symbolic constants and argument structures
for the architecture-dependent
functions can be found in the header file
.In machine/sysarch.h .
.Pp
The
.Fn sysarch
system call should never be called directly by
user programs.
Instead, they should access
its functions using the architecture-dependent
library.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
See the manual pages for specific architecture-dependent system calls
for information about their return values.
