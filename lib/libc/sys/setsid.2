.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn setsid
function creates a new session.
The calling process is the session leader of the new session, is the
process group leader of a new process group and has no controlling
terminal.
The calling process is the only process in either the session or the
process group.
.Pp
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn setsid
function returns the value of the process group ID of the new process
group, which is the same as the process ID of the calling process.

returns \-1 and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error, as follows:
