The calling process is the only process in either the session or the
process group.

.Fn setsid
system call returns the value of the process group ID of the new process
group, which is the same as the process ID of the calling process.
If an error occurs,
.Fn setsid
returns -1 and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
