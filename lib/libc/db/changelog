#	$OpenBSD: changelog,v 1.2 1996/08/19 08:19:57 tholo Exp $

1.84 -> 1.85
	recno:	#ifdef out use of mmap, it's not portable enough.

1.83 -> 1.84	Thu Aug 18 15:46:07 EDT 1994
	recno:	Rework fixed-length records so that closing and reopening
		the file now works.  Pad short records on input.  Never do
		signed comparison in recno input reading functions.

1.82 -> 1.83	Tue Jul 26 15:33:44 EDT 1994
	btree:	Rework cursor deletion code yet again; bugs with
		deleting empty pages that only contained the cursor
		record.

1.81 -> 1.82	Sat Jul 16 11:01:50 EDT 1994
	btree:	Fix bugs introduced by new cursor/deletion code.
		Replace return kbuf/dbuf with real DBT's.

1.80 -> 1.81
	btree:	Fix bugs introduced by new cursor/deletion code.
	all:	Add #defines for Purify.

1.79 -> 1.80	Wed Jul 13 22:41:54 EDT 1994
	btree	Change deletion to coalesce empty pages.  This is a major
		change, cursors and duplicate pages all had to be reworked.
		Return to a fixed stack.
	recno:	Affected by cursor changes.  New cursor structures should
		permit multiple cursors in the future.

1.78 -> 1.79	Mon Jun 20 17:36:47 EDT 1994
	all:	Minor cleanups of 1.78 for porting reasons; only
		major change was inlining check of NULL pointer
		so that __fix_realloc goes away.

1.77 -> 1.78	Thu Jun 16 19:06:43 EDT 1994
	all:	Move "standard" size typedef's into db.h.

1.76 -> 1.77	Thu Jun 16 16:48:38 EDT 1994
	hash:	Delete __init_ routine, has special meaning to OSF 2.0.

1.74 -> 1.76
	all:	Finish up the port to the Alpha.

1.73 -> 1.74
	recno:	Don't put the record if rec_search fails, in rec_rdelete.
		Create fixed-length intermediate records past "end" of DB
		correctly.
		Realloc bug when reading in fixed records.
	all:	First cut at port to Alpha (64-bit architecture) using
		4.4BSD basic integral types typedef's.
		Cast allocation pointers to shut up old compilers.
		Rework PORT directory into OS/machine directories.

1.72 -> 1.73
	btree:	If enough duplicate records were inserted and then deleted
		that internal pages had references to empty pages of the
		duplicate keys, the search function ended up on the wrong
		page.

1.7  -> 1.72	12 Oct 1993
	hash:	Support NET/2 hash formats.

1.7  -> 1.71	16 Sep 1993
	btree/recno:
		Fix bug in internal search routines that caused
		return of invalid pointers.

1.6  -> 1.7	07 Sep 1993
	hash:	Fixed big key overflow bugs.
	test:	Portability hacks, rewrite test script, Makefile.
	btree/recno:
		Stop copying non-overflow key/data pairs.
	PORT:	Break PORT directory up into per architecture/OS
		subdirectories.

1.5  -> 1.6	06 Jun 1993
	hash:	In PAIRFITS, the first comparison should look at (P)[2].
		The hash_realloc function was walking off the end of memory.
		The overflow page number was wrong when bumping splitpoint.

1.4  -> 1.5	23 May 1993
	hash:	Set hash default fill factor dynamically.
	recno:	Fixed bug in sorted page splits.
		Add page size parameter support.
		Allow recno to specify the name of the underlying btree;
			used for vi recovery.
	btree/recno:
		Support 64K pages.
	btree/hash/recno:
		Provide access to an underlying file descriptor.
		Change sync routines to take a flag argument, recno
			uses this to sync out the underlying btree.

1.3  -> 1.4	10 May 1993
	recno:	Delete the R_CURSORLOG flag from the recno interface.
		Zero-length record fix for non-mmap reads.
		Try and make SIZE_T_MAX test in open portable.

1.2  -> 1.3	01 May 1993
	btree:	Ignore user byte-order setting when reading already
		existing database.  Fixes to byte-order conversions.

1.1  -> 1.2	15 Apr 1993
		No bug fixes, only compatibility hacks.
