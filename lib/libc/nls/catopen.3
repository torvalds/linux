.Dt CATOPEN 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm catopen
.Nd open message catalog
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In nl_types.h
.Ft nl_catd
.Fn catopen "const char *name" "int oflag"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn catopen
function opens the message catalog specified by
.Fa name
and returns a message catalog descriptor.
If
.Fa name
contains a
.Sq /
then
.Fa name
specifies the full pathname for the message catalog, otherwise the value
of the environment variable
.Ev NLSPATH
is used with
the following substitutions:
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It \&%N
The value of the
.Fa name
argument.
.It \&%L
The value of the
.Ev LANG
environment variable or the
.Dv LC_MESSAGES
category (see below).
.It \&%l
The language element from the
.Ev LANG
environment variable or from the
.Dv LC_MESSAGES
category.
.It \&%t
The territory element from the
.Ev LANG
environment variable or from the
.Dv LC_MESSAGES
category.
.It \&%c
The codeset element from the
.Ev LANG
environment variable or from the
.Dv LC_MESSAGES
category.
.It \&%%
A single % character.
.El
.Pp
An empty string is substituted for undefined values.
.Pp
Path names templates defined in
.Ev NLSPATH
are separated by colons
.Pq Sq \&: .
A leading or two adjacent colons
is equivalent to specifying %N.
.Pp
If the
.Fa oflag
argument is set to the
.Dv NL_CAT_LOCALE
constant,
.Dv LC_MESSAGES
locale category used to open the message catalog; using
.Dv NL_CAT_LOCALE
conforms to the
.St -xpg4
standard.
You can specify 0 for compatibility with
.St -xpg3 ;
when
.Fa oflag
is set to 0, the
.Ev LANG
environment variable
determines the message catalog locale.
.Pp
A message catalog descriptor
remains valid in a process until that process closes it, or
until a successful call to one of the
.Xr exec 3
function.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn catopen
returns a message catalog descriptor.
Otherwise, (nl_catd) -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Argument
.Fa name
does not point to a valid message catalog, or catalog is corrupt.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
An entire path to the message catalog exceeded 1024 characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named message catalog does not exists, or the
.Fa name
argument points to an empty string.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Insufficient memory is available.
