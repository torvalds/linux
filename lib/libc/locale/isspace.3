.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm isspace
.Nd white-space character test
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn isspace "int c"
.Ft int
.Fn isspace_l "int c" "locale_t loc"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isspace
function tests for white-space characters.
For any locale, this includes the following standard characters:
.Bl -column \&`\et''___ \&``\et''___ \&``\et''___ \&``\et''___ \&``\et''___ \&``\et''___
.It "\&``\et''" Ta "``\en''" Ta "``\ev''" Ta "``\ef''" Ta "``\er''" Ta "`` ''"
.El
.Pp
In the "C" locale,
.Fn isspace
returns non-zero for these characters only.
The value of the argument must be representable as an
.Vt "unsigned char"
or the value of
.Dv EOF .
.Pp
The
.Fn isspace_l
function takes an explicit locale argument, whereas the
.Fn isspace
function uses the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn isspace
and
.Fn isspace_l
functions return zero if the character tests false and
return non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Bx 4.4
extension of accepting arguments outside of the range of the
.Vt "unsigned char"
type in locales with large character sets is considered obsolete
and may not be supported in future releases.
The
.Fn iswspace
function should be used instead.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ctype 3 ,
.Xr iswspace 3 ,
.Xr multibyte 3 ,
.Xr ascii 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn isspace
function conforms to
.St -isoC .
The
.Fn isspace_l
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
