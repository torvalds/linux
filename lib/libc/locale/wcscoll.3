.Sh NAME
.Nm wcscoll ,
.Nm wcscoll_l
.Nd compare wide strings according to the current collation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In wchar.h
.Ft int
.Fn wcscoll "const wchar_t *s1" "const wchar_t *s2"
.Ft int
.Fn wcscoll_l "const wchar_t *s1" "const wchar_t *s2" "locale_t locale"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wcscoll
and
.Fn wcscoll_l
functions lexicographically compare the NUL-terminated wide strings
.Fa s1
and
.Fa s2
according to the current locale collation
and return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
according to whether
.Fa s1
is greater than, equal to, or less than
.Fa s2 .
.Pp
On
.Ox ,
they have the same effect as
.Xr wcscmp 3 ,
and the global locale, the thread-specific locale, and the
.Fa locale
argument are ignored.
On other operating systems, the results may depend on the
.Dv LC_CTYPE
and
.Dv LC_COLLATE
locale categories set with
.Xr setlocale 3 ,
.Xr uselocale 3 ,
or
.Xr newlocale 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr newlocale 3 ,
.Xr setlocale 3 ,
.Xr wcscmp 3 ,
.Xr wcsxfrm 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wcscoll
function conforms to
.St -isoC-99 ,
and
.Fn wcscoll_l
to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn wcscoll
function has been available since
.Ox 4.8 ,
and
.Fn wcscoll_l
since
.Ox 6.2 .
