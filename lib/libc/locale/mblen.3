.Sh NAME
.Nm mblen
.Nd get number of bytes in a character
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft int
.Fn mblen "const char *mbchar" "size_t nbytes"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mblen
function computes the length in bytes
of a multibyte character
.Fa mbchar
according to the current conversion state.
Up to
.Fa nbytes
bytes are examined.
.Pp
A call with a null
.Fa mbchar
pointer returns nonzero if the current locale requires shift states,
zero otherwise;
if shift states are required, the shift state is reset to the initial state.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If
.Fa mbchar
is
.Dv NULL ,
the
.Fn mblen
function returns nonzero if shift states are supported,
zero otherwise.
.Pp
Otherwise, if
.Fa mbchar
is not a null pointer,
.Fn mblen
either returns 0 if
.Fa mbchar
represents the null wide character, or returns
the number of bytes processed in
.Fa mbchar ,
or returns \-1 if no multibyte character
could be recognized or converted.
In this case,
.Fn mblen Ns 's
internal conversion state is undefined.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn mblen
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
An invalid multibyte sequence was detected.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The internal conversion state is not valid.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mbrlen 3 ,
.Xr mbtowc 3 ,
.Xr multibyte 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn mblen
function conforms to
.St -isoC-99 .
