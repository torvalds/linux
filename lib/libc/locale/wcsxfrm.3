.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm wcsxfrm ,
.Nm wcsxfrm_l
.Nd transform a wide string under locale
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In wchar.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn wcsxfrm "wchar_t *dst" "const wchar_t *src" "size_t n"
.Ft size_t
.Fn wcsxfrm_l "wchar_t *dst" "const wchar_t *src" "size_t n" "locale_t locale"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The idea of
.Fn wcsxfrm
and
.Fn wcsxfrm_l
is to
.Dq un-localize
a wide string: the functions transform
.Ar src ,
storing the result in
.Ar dst ,
such that
.Xr wcscmp 3
on transformed wide strings returns what
.Xr wcscoll 3
on the original untransformed wide strings would return.
.Pp
On
.Ox ,
both have the same effect as
.Xr wcslcpy 3 ,
and the global locale, the thread-specific locale, and the
.Fa locale
argument are ignored.
On other operating systems, the behaviour may depend on the
.Dv LC_CTYPE
and
.Dv LC_COLLATE
locale categories set with
.Xr setlocale 3 ,
.Xr uselocale 3 ,
or
.Xr newlocale 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr newlocale 3 ,
.Xr setlocale 3 ,
.Xr wcscmp 3 ,
.Xr wcscoll 3 ,
.Xr wcslcpy 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wcsxfrm
function conforms to
.St -isoC-99 ,
and
.Fn wcsxfrm_l
to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn wcsxfrm
function has been available since
.Ox 4.8 ,
and
.Fn wcsxfrm_l
since
.Ox 6.2 .
