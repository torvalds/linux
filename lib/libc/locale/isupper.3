.Sh NAME
.Nm isupper
.Nd upper-case character test
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn isupper "int c"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isupper
function tests for any upper-case letter.
The value of the argument must be representable as an
.Vt "unsigned char"
or the value of
.Dv EOF .
.Pp
In the ASCII character set, this includes the following characters
(with their numeric values shown in octal):
.Bl -column \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__
.It "\&101\ ``A''" Ta "102\ ``B''" Ta "103\ ``C''" Ta "104\ ``D''" Ta "105\ ``E''"
.It "\&106\ ``F''" Ta "107\ ``G''" Ta "110\ ``H''" Ta "111\ ``I''" Ta "112\ ``J''"
.It "\&113\ ``K''" Ta "114\ ``L''" Ta "115\ ``M''" Ta "116\ ``N''" Ta "117\ ``O''"
.It "\&120\ ``P''" Ta "121\ ``Q''" Ta "122\ ``R''" Ta "123\ ``S''" Ta "124\ ``T''"
.It "\&125\ ``U''" Ta "126\ ``V''" Ta "127\ ``W''" Ta "130\ ``X''" Ta "131\ ``Y''"
.It "\&132\ ``Z''" Ta \& Ta \& Ta \& Ta \&
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn isupper
function returns zero if the character tests false and
returns non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Bx 4.4
extension of accepting arguments outside of the range of the
.Vt "unsigned char"
type in locales with large character sets is considered obsolete
and may not be supported in future releases.
The
.Fn iswupper
function should be used instead.

.Xr iswupper 3 ,

.Xr ascii 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn isupper
function conforms to
.St -isoC .
