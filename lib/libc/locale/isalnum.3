.Sh NAME
.Nm isalnum
.Nd alphanumeric character test
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn isalnum "int c"
.Ft int
.Fn isalnum_l "int c" "locale_t loc"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isalnum
function tests for any character for which
.Xr isalpha 3
or
.Xr isdigit 3
is true.
The value of the argument must be representable as an
.Vt "unsigned char"
or the value of
.Dv EOF .
.Pp
In the ASCII character set, this includes the following characters
(with their numeric values shown in octal):
.Bl -column \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__

.Pp
The
.Fn isalnum_l
function takes an explicit locale argument, whereas the
.Fn isalnum
function uses the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn isalnum
function returns zero if the character tests false and
returns non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Bx 4.4
extension of accepting arguments outside of the range of the
.Vt "unsigned char"
type in locales with large character sets is considered obsolete
and may not be supported in future releases.
The
.Fn iswalnum
function should be used instead.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn isalnum
function conforms to
.St -isoC .
The
.Fn isalnum_l
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
