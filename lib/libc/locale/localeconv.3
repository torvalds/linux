.Dt LOCALECONV 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm localeconv
.Nd retrieve parameters for locale-dependent formatting of numbers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In locale.h
.Ft struct lconv *
.Fn localeconv "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn localeconv
function returns a pointer to a static structure
which provides parameters for
.Xr locale 1 Ns -dependent
formatting of numbers.
On
.Ox ,
nothing in the returned structure ever changes.
On other operating systems, the contents of the structure may vary
according to the
.Dv LC_NUMERIC
and
.Dv LC_MONETARY
locale categories.
.Pp
It provides the following fields of type
.Vt char * :
.Bl -tag -width mon_decimal_point
.It Fa decimal_point
The decimal point character, except for currency values.
.It Fa thousands_sep
The separator between groups of digits
before the decimal point, except for currency values.
.It Fa grouping
The sizes of the groups of digits, except for currency values.
This is a pointer to a vector of integers, each of size
.Vt char ,
representing group size from low order digit groups
to high order (right to left).
The list may be terminated with 0 or
.Dv CHAR_MAX .
If the list is terminated with 0,
the last group size before the 0 is repeated to account for all the digits.
If the list is terminated with
.Dv CHAR_MAX ,
no more grouping is performed.
.It Fa int_curr_symbol
The standardized international currency symbol.
.It Fa currency_symbol
The local currency symbol.
.It Fa mon_decimal_point
The decimal point character for currency values.
.It Fa mon_thousands_sep
The separator for digit groups in currency values.
.It Fa mon_grouping
Like
.Fa grouping
but for currency values.
.It Fa positive_sign
The character used to denote non-negative currency values,
usually the empty string.
.It Fa negative_sign
The character used to denote negative currency values,
usually a minus sign.
.El
.Pp
It also provides the following fields of type
.Vt char :
.Bl -tag -width mon_decimal_point
.It Fa int_frac_digits
The number of digits after the decimal point
in an international-style currency value.
.It Fa frac_digits
The number of digits after the decimal point
in the local style for currency values.
.It Fa p_cs_precedes
1 if the currency symbol precedes the currency value
for non-negative values, 0 if it follows.
.It Fa p_sep_by_space
1 if a space is inserted between the currency symbol
and the currency value for non-negative values, 0 otherwise.
.It Fa n_cs_precedes
Like
.Fa p_cs_precedes
but for negative values.
.It Fa n_sep_by_space
Like
.Fa p_sep_by_space
but for negative values.
.It Fa p_sign_posn
The location of the
.Fa positive_sign
with respect to a non-negative quantity and the
.Fa currency_symbol ,
coded as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 3n -compact
.It Li 0
Parentheses around the entire string.
.It Li 1
Before the string.
.It Li 2
After the string.
.It Li 3
Just before
.Fa currency_symbol .
.It Li 4
Just after
.Fa currency_symbol .
.El
.It Fa n_sign_posn
Like
.Fa p_sign_posn
but for negative currency values.
.It Fa int_p_cs_precedes
Like
.Fa p_cs_precedes
but for the international symbol.
.It Fa int_n_cs_precedes
Like
.Fa n_cs_precedes
but for the international symbol.
.It Fa int_p_sep_by_space
Like
.Fa p_sep_by_space
but for the international symbol.
.It Fa int_n_sep_by_space
Like
.Fa n_sep_by_space
but for the international symbol.
.It Fa int_p_sign_posn
Like
.Fa p_sign_posn
but for the international symbol.
.It Fa int_n_sign_posn
Like
.Fa n_sign_posn
but for the international symbol.
.El
.Pp
Unless mentioned above,
an empty string as a value for a field
indicates a zero length result or
a value that is not in the current locale.
A
.Dv CHAR_MAX
result similarly denotes an unavailable value.
