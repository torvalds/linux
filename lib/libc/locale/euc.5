.Nm EUC
implements a system of 4 multibyte codesets.
A multibyte character in the first codeset consists of
.Ar len1
bytes starting with a byte in the range of 0x00 to 0x7f.
To allow use of
.Tn ASCII ,
.Ar len1
is always 1.
A multibyte character in the second codeset consists of
.Ar len2
bytes starting with a byte in the range of 0x80-0xff excluding 0x8e and 0x8f.
A multibyte character in the third codeset consists of
.Ar len3
bytes starting with the byte 0x8e.
A multibyte character in the fourth codeset consists of
.Ar len4
bytes starting with the byte 0x8f.
.Pp
The
.Vt wchar_t
encoding of
.Nm EUC
multibyte characters is dependent on the
.Ar len
and
.Ar mask
arguments.
First, the bytes are moved into a
.Vt wchar_t
as follows:
.Bd -literal
byte0 << ((\fIlen\fPN-1) * 8) | byte1 << ((\fIlen\fPN-2) * 8) | ... | byte\fIlen\fPN-1
.Ed
.Pp
The result is then ANDed with
.Ar ~mask
and ORed with
.Ar maskN .
Codesets 2 and 3 are special in that the leading byte (0x8e or 0x8f) is
first removed and the
.Ar lenN
argument is reduced by 1.
.Pp
For example, the
.Li ja_JP.eucJP
locale has the following
.Va VARIABLE
line:
.Bd -literal
VARIABLE	1 0x0000 2 0x8080 2 0x0080 3 0x8000 0x8080
.Ed
.Pp
Codeset 1 consists of the values 0x0000 - 0x007f.
.Pp
Codeset 2 consists of the values who have the bits 0x8080 set.
.Pp
Codeset 3 consists of the values 0x0080 - 0x00ff.
.Pp
Codeset 4 consists of the values 0x8000 - 0xff7f excluding the values
which have the 0x0080 bit set.
.Pp
Notice that the global
.Ar mask
is set to 0x8080, this implies that from those 2 bits the codeset can
be determined.
