.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions test whether the wide character
.Fa wc

is changed with
.Xr uselocale 3
or when the global character encoding locale is changed with
.Xr setlocale 3 .
When
.Fa charclass
is retrieved with
.Xr wctype_l 3 ,
it is only valid for use with the same
.Fa locale
argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return zero if the character tests false
or non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr iswalnum 3 ,
.Xr newlocale 3 ,
