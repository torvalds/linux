.Ft int
.Fn iswctype "wint_t wc" "wctype_t charclass"
.Ft wctype_t
.Fn wctype "const char *property"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wctype
function returns a value of type
.Vt wctype_t
which represents the requested wide character class and
may be used as the second argument for calls to
.Fn iswctype .
.Pp

The
.Fn iswctype
function checks whether the wide character

.Fa wc
has the property described by
.Fa charclass ,
or
.Fa charclass
is zero.
.Pp

.Fa property
is invalid, otherwise it returns a value of type
.Vt wctype_t
that can be used in subsequent calls to

Reimplement
.Xr iswalpha 3

myiswalpha(wint_t wc)
{
	return (iswctype(wc, wctype("alpha")));
