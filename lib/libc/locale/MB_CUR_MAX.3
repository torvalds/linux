.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm MB_CUR_MAX
.Nd maximum number of bytes in a multibyte character
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft size_t
.Sy MB_CUR_MAX
.Pp
.In limits.h
.Fd #define MB_LEN_MAX 4
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a macro that returns the maximum number of bytes needed to
represent any multibyte character in the current character encoding.
Usually, the character encoding is selected for the whole program using
.Xr setlocale 3
with a
.Fa category
argument of
.Dv LC_CTYPE ,
but it can be overridden on a per-thread basis using
.Xr uselocale 3 .
.Pp
By default and in the
.Qq C
locale,
.Nm MB_CUR_MAX
returns 1.
On
.Ox ,
the only other possible return value is 4;
it occurs when using a UTF-8 locale.
On other systems,
.Nm
may return positive values other than 1 or 4.
.Pp
.Dv MB_LEN_MAX
is a constant specifying the maximum number of bytes needed to
represent any multibyte character in any supported character encoding.
On
.Ox ,
it is always 4.
On other systems, it may have a different value greater than or equal to 1.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On any system,
.Nm
returns an integral value in the range from 1 to
.Dv MB_LEN_MAX ,
inclusive.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Size a buffer in a portable way to hold one single multibyte character:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
char	 buf[MB_LEN_MAX];
wchar_t	 wchar;  /* input value */

if (wctomb(buf, wchar) == -1)
	/* error */
.Ed
.Pp
Switch between code handling the
.Xr ascii 7
and
UTF-8 character encodings in an
.Ox Ns -specific
way
.Pq not portable :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if (MB_CUR_MAX == 1) {
	/* Code to handle ASCII-encoded single-byte strings. */
} else {
	/* Code to handle UTF-8-encoded multibyte strings. */
}
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mblen 3 ,
.Xr setlocale 3 ,
.Xr uselocale 3 ,
.Xr wctomb 3
.Sh STANDARDS
.Nm MB_CUR_MAX
and
.Dv MB_LEN_MAX
conform to
.St -ansiC .
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm MB_CUR_MAX
has been non-constant and thread-dependent since
.Ox 6.2 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Since
.Nm
is thread-dependent, calling it in a loop that processes individual
bytes or characters is likely to slow down the loop considerably.
If possible, consider calling it once before the loop and caching
the return value in a local variable to improve performance.
The value remains valid as long as the thread does not call
.Xr setlocale 3
or
.Xr uselocale 3 .
