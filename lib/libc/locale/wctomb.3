.Sh NAME
.Nm wctomb
.Nd convert a wide-character code to a character
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft int
.Fn wctomb "char *mbchar" "wchar_t wchar"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wctomb
function converts a wide character
.Fa wchar
into a multibyte character and stores
the result in
.Fa mbchar .
The object pointed to by
.Fa mbchar
must be large enough to accommodate the multibyte character, which
may be up to
.Dv MB_LEN_MAX
bytes.
.Pp
A call with a null
.Fa mbchar
pointer returns nonzero if the current locale requires shift states,
zero otherwise;
if shift states are required, the shift state is reset to the initial state.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If
.Fa mbchar
is
.Dv NULL ,
the
.Fn wctomb
function returns nonzero if shift states are supported,
zero otherwise.
If
.Fa mbchar
is valid,
.Fn wctomb
returns
the number of bytes processed in
.Fa mbchar ,
or \-1 if no multibyte character
could be recognized or converted.
In this case,
.Fn wctomb Ns 's
internal conversion state is undefined.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn wctomb
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
An invalid multibyte sequence was detected.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The internal conversion state is invalid.
