.Ft wint_t
.Fn towctrans_l "wint_t wc" "wctrans_t charmap" "locale_t locale"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions convert the wide character
.Fa wc
with a character mapping
.Fa charmap .
.Pp

is changed with
.Xr uselocale 3
or when the global character encoding locale is changed with
.Xr setlocale 3 .
When
.Fa charmap
is retrieved with
.Xr wctrans_l 3 ,
it is only valid for use with the same
.Fa locale
argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return the resulting wide character, or
.Fa wc
if there is no corresponding character in
.Fa charmap .
