.Dt ISBLANK 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm isblank
.Nd space or tab character test
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn isblank "int c"
.Ft int
.Fn isblank_l "int c" "locale_t loc"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isblank
function tests for a space or tab character.
For any locale, this includes the following standard characters:
.Bl -column XXXX
.It Do \et Dc Ta Dq " "
.El
.Pp
In the "C" locale, a successful
.Fn isblank
test is limited to these characters only.
The value of the argument must be representable as an
.Vt "unsigned char"
or the value of
.Dv EOF .
.Pp
The
.Fn isblank_l
function takes an explicit locale argument, whereas the
.Fn isblank
function uses the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn isblank
function returns zero if the character tests false and
returns non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Bx 4.4
extension of accepting arguments outside of the range of the
.Vt "unsigned char"
type in locales with large character sets is considered obsolete
and may not be supported in future releases.
The
.Fn iswblank
function should be used instead.

.Fn isblank
function
conforms to
