.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm isgraph
.Nd printing character test (space character exclusive)
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn isgraph "int c"
.Ft int
.Fn isgraph_l "int c" "locale_t loc"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isgraph
function tests for any printing character except space
.Pq Ql "\~"
and other
locale-specific space-like characters.
The value of the argument must be representable as an
.Vt "unsigned char"
or the value of
.Dv EOF .
.Pp
In the ASCII character set, this includes the following characters
(with their numeric values shown in octal):
.Bl -column \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__ \&000_``0''__

.Pp
The
.Fn isgraph_l
function takes an explicit locale argument, whereas the
.Fn isgraph
function uses the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn isgraph
and
.Fn isgraph_l
functions return zero if the character tests false and
return non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The
.Bx 4.4
extension of accepting arguments outside of the range of the
.Vt "unsigned char"
type in locales with large character sets is considered obsolete
and may not be supported in future releases.
The
.Fn iswgraph
function should be used instead.

.Xr iswgraph 3 ,
.Xr ascii 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn isgraph
function conforms to
.St -isoC .
The
.Fn isgraph_l
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
