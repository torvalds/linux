.Fn svcerr_weakauth "SVCXPRT *xprt"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These routines are part of the RPC
library which allows C language programs to make procedure
calls on other machines across the network.
.Pp
These routines can be called by the server side
dispatch function if there is any error in the
transaction with the client.
.Sh Routines
See
.Xr rpc 3
for the definition of the
.Vt SVCXPRT
data structure.
.Bl -tag -width XXXXX
.It Fn svcerr_auth
Called by a service dispatch routine that refuses to perform
a remote procedure call due to an authentication error.
.It Fn svcerr_decode
Called by a service dispatch routine that cannot successfully
decode the remote arguments
(see
.Fn svc_getargs
in
.Xr rpc_svc_reg 3 ) .
.It Fn svcerr_noproc
Called by a service dispatch routine that does not implement
the procedure number that the caller requests.
.It Fn svcerr_noprog
Called when the desired program is not registered with the
RPC package.
Service implementors usually do not need this routine.
.It Fn svcerr_progvers
Called when the desired version of a program is not registered with the
RPC package.
The
.Fa low_vers
argument
is the lowest version number,
and
.Fa high_vers
is the highest version number.
Service implementors usually do not need this routine.
.It Fn svcerr_systemerr
Called by a service dispatch routine when it detects a system
error not covered by any particular protocol.
For example, if a service can no longer allocate storage,
it may call this routine.
.It Fn svcerr_weakauth
Called by a service dispatch routine that refuses to perform
a remote procedure call due to insufficient (but correct)
authentication arguments.
The routine calls
.Fn svcerr_auth "xprt" "AUTH_TOOWEAK" .
