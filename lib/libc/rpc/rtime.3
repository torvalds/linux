.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn rtime
function
consults the Internet Time Server at the address pointed to by
.Fa addrp
and returns the remote time in the
.Vt timeval
struct pointed to by
.Fa timep .
Normally, the
.Tn UDP
protocol is used when consulting the Time Server.
The
.Fa timeout
argument specifies how long the
routine should wait before giving
up when waiting for a reply.
If
.Fa timeout
is specified as
.Dv NULL ,
however, the routine will instead use
.Tn TCP
and block until a reply is received from the time server.
