.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm wcslen ,
.Nm wcsnlen
.Nd find length of a wide string
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In wchar.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn wcslen "const wchar_t *s"
.Ft size_t
.Fn wcsnlen "const wchar_t *s" "size_t maxlen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wcslen
function computes the length of the wide string
.Fa s .
The
.Fn wcsnlen
function computes the length of the wide string
.Fa s ,
up to
.Fa maxlen
wide characters.
The
.Fn wcsnlen
function will never attempt to address more than
.Fa maxlen
wide characters, making it suitable for use with wide character arrays
that are not guaranteed to be NUL-terminated.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn wcslen
function returns the number of wide characters that precede the terminating
null wide character.
.Pp
The
.Fn wcsnlen
function returns the number of wide characters that precede the terminating
null wide character
or
.Fa maxlen ,
whichever is smaller.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr wcswidth 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wcslen
function conforms to
.St -isoC-99
and was first introduced in
