.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In string.h
.Ft void *
.Fn memccpy "void *dst" "const void *src" "int c" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn memccpy
function
copies bytes from string
.Fa src
to string
.Fa dst .
If the character
.Fa c
(as converted to an
.Vt "unsigned char" )
occurs in the string
.Fa src ,
the copy stops and a pointer to the byte after the copy of
.Fa c
in the string
.Fa dst
is returned.
Otherwise,
.Fa len
bytes are copied, and a NULL pointer is returned.

.Fn memccpy
function first appeared in
