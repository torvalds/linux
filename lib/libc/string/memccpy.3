.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm memccpy
.Nd copy string until character found
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In string.h
.Ft void *
.Fn memccpy "void *dst" "const void *src" "int c" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn memccpy
function copies bytes from string
.Fa src
to string
.Fa dst .
If the character
.Fa c
(as converted to an
.Vt unsigned char )
occurs in the string
.Fa src ,
the copy stops and a pointer to the byte after the copy of
.Fa c
in the string
.Fa dst
is returned.
Otherwise,
.Fa len
bytes are copied, and a null pointer is returned.
.Pp
If the
.Fa src
and
.Fa dst
strings overlap, the behavior is undefined.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bcopy 3 ,
.Xr memcpy 3 ,
.Xr memmove 3 ,
.Xr strcpy 3 ,
.Xr strlcpy 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn memccpy
function first appeared in
.At V
and was reimplemented for
.Bx 4.3 .
