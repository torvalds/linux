function
allocates sufficient memory for a copy

to an allocated area of memory containing the nul-terminated string
.Qq foobar :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
const char	*o = "foobar";
wchar_t		*p, b[32];
size_t		 blen;

blen = sizeof(b) / sizeof(b[0]);
if (mbstowcs(b, o, blen) == (size_t)-1)
	err(1, NULL);
b[blen - 1] = 0;
if ((p = wcsdup(b)) == NULL)
	err(1, NULL);
