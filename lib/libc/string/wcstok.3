.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm wcstok
.Nd split wide-character string into tokens
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In wchar.h
.Ft wchar_t *
.Fn wcstok "wchar_t * restrict str" "const wchar_t * restrict sep" "wchar_t ** restrict last"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wcstok
function
is used to isolate sequential tokens in a NUL-terminated wide-character
string,
.Fa str .
These tokens are separated in the string by at least one of the
characters in
.Fa sep .
The first time that
.Fn wcstok
is called,
.Fa str
should be specified; subsequent calls, wishing to obtain further tokens
from the same string, should pass a null pointer instead.
The separator string,
.Fa sep ,
must be supplied each time, and may change between calls.
The context pointer
.Fa last
must be provided on each call.
.Pp
The
.Fn wcstok
function is the wide-character counterpart of the
.Xr strtok_r 3
function.
.Pp
Since
.Fn wcstok
modifies the string,
.Fa str
should not point to an area in the initialized data segment.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn wcstok
function
returns a pointer to the beginning of each subsequent token in the string,
after replacing the token itself with a NUL wide character (L'\e0').
When no more tokens remain, a null pointer is returned.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code fragment splits a wide-character string on
.Tn ASCII
space, tab, and newline characters and writes the tokens to
standard output:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
const wchar_t *seps = L" \et\en";
wchar_t *last, *tok, text[] = L" \enone\ettwo\et\etthree  \en";

for (tok = wcstok(text, seps, &last); tok != NULL;
    tok = wcstok(NULL, seps, &last))
	wprintf(L"%ls\en", tok);

.Xr wmemchr 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wcstok
function
conforms to
.St -isoC-99 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn wcstok
function was ported from
.Nx
and first appeared in
.Ox 3.8 .
.Pp
Some early implementations of
.Fn wcstok
omit the
context pointer argument,
.Fa last ,
and maintain state across calls in a static variable like
.Xr strtok 3
does.
