.Nd compare strings
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In string.h
.Ft int
.Fn strcmp "const char *s1" "const char *s2"
.Ft int
.Fn strncmp "const char *s1" "const char *s2" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strcmp
and
.Fn strncmp
functions lexicographically compare the NUL-terminated strings
.Fa s1
and
.Fa s2 .
The
.Fn strncmp
function compares at most
.Fa len
characters.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn strcmp
and
.Fn strncmp
functions return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, according
to whether the string
.Fa s1
is greater than, equal to, or less than the string
.Fa s2 .
The comparison is done using unsigned characters, so that
.Ql \e200
is greater than
.Ql \e0 .
