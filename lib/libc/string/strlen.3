.Sh NAME
.Nm strlen ,
.Nm strnlen
.Nd find length of a string

.In string.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn strlen "const char *s"
.Ft size_t
.Fn strnlen "const char *s" "size_t maxlen"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strlen
function computes the length of the string
.Fa s .
.Pp
The
.Fn strnlen
function computes the length of the string
.Fa s ,
up to
.Fa maxlen
characters.
The
.Fn strnlen
function will never attempt to address more than
.Fa maxlen
characters, making it suitable for use with character arrays that are
not guaranteed to be NUL-terminated.
.Sh RETURN VALUES

.Fn strlen
function returns the number of characters that precede the terminating
.Tn NUL
character.
.Pp
The
.Fn strnlen
function returns the number of characters that precede the terminating
.Tn NUL
or
.Fa maxlen ,
whichever is smaller.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr wcslen 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn strlen
function conforms to
.St -ansiC .
.Pp
The
.Fn strlen
and
