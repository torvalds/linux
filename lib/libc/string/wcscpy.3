.Dt WCSCPY 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm wcscpy ,
.Nm wcsncpy
.Nd copy wide strings
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In wchar.h
.Ft wchar_t *
.Fn wcscpy "wchar_t * restrict dst" "const wchar_t * restrict src"
.Ft wchar_t *
.Fo wcsncpy
.Fa "wchar_t * restrict dst"
.Fa "const wchar_t * restrict src"
.Fa "size_t len"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wcscpy
and
.Fn wcsncpy
functions copy the wide string
.Fa src
to
.Fa dst
(including the terminating null wide character).
.Pp
The
.Fn wcsncpy
function copies not more than
.Fa len
wide characters to
.Fa dst ,
appending null wide characters if the length of
.Fa src
is less than
.Fa len ,
and
.Em not
terminating
.Fa dst
if the length of
.Fa src
is greater than or equal to
.Fa len .
.Pp
If the
.Fa src
and
.Fa dst
strings overlap, the behavior is undefined.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn wcscpy
and
.Fn wcsncpy
functions return
.Fa dst .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr strcpy 3 ,
.Xr strlcpy 3 ,
.Xr wcscat 3 ,
.Xr wcslcpy 3 ,
.Xr wmemcpy 3 ,
.Xr wmemmove 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wcscpy
and
.Fn wcsncpy
functions conform to
.St -isoC-99
and were first introduced in
.St -isoC-amd1 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn wcscpy
and
.Fn wcsncpy
functions were ported from
.Nx
and first appeared in
.Ox 3.8 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Using the functions
.Fn wcscpy
and
.Fn wcsncpy
is very error-prone with respect to buffer overflows;
see the EXAMPLES section in
.Xr strncpy 3
for correct usage.
Using
.Xr wcslcpy 3
is a better choice in most cases.
