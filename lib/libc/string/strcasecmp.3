.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions compare the NUL-terminated strings
.Fa s1
and
.Fa s2
and return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
according to whether
.Fa s1
is lexicographically greater than, equal to, or less than
.Fa s2
after translation of each corresponding character to lower-case.
The strings themselves are not modified.
The comparison is done using unsigned characters, so that
.Sq Li \e200
is greater than
.Ql \e0 .
.Pp
.Fn strncasecmp
and
.Fn strncasecmp_l
compare at most
.Fa len
characters.
.Pp
On
.Ox ,
these functions always use the C locale and ignore
the global locale, the thread-specific locale, and the
.Fa locale
argument.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
On other operating systems, the behaviour of
.Fn strcasecmp
and
.Fn strncasecmp
may depend on the
.Dv LC_CTYPE
.Xr locale 1 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr strcmp 3 ,
.Xr strcoll 3 ,
.Xr strxfrm 3 ,
.Xr wcscasecmp 3
.Sh STANDARDS
These functions conform to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn strcasecmp
and
.Fn strncasecmp
functions have been available since
.Bx 4.3 Tahoe ,
and
.Fn strcasecmp_l
and
.Fn strncasecmp_l
since
.Ox 6.2 .
