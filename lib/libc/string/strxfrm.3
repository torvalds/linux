.Dt STRXFRM 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm strxfrm ,
.Nm strxfrm_l
.Nd transform a string under locale
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In string.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn strxfrm "char *dst" "const char *src" "size_t n"
.Ft size_t
.Fn strxfrm_l "char *dst" "const char *src" "size_t n" "locale_t locale"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The idea of
.Fn strxfrm
and
.Fn strxfrm_l
is to
.Dq un-localize
a string: the functions transform
.Ar src ,
storing the result in
.Ar dst ,
such that
.Xr strcmp 3
on transformed strings returns what
.Xr strcoll 3
on the original untransformed strings would return.
.Pp
On
.Ox ,
both have the same effect as
.Xr strlcpy 3 ,
and the global locale, the thread-specific locale, and the
.Fa locale
argument are ignored.
On other operating systems, the behaviour may depend on the
.Dv LC_CTYPE
and
.Dv LC_COLLATE
locale categories set with
.Xr setlocale 3 ,
.Xr uselocale 3 ,
or
.Xr newlocale 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr newlocale 3 ,
.Xr setlocale 3 ,
.Xr strcmp 3 ,
.Xr strcoll 3 ,
.Xr strlcpy 3 ,
.Xr wcsxfrm 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn strxfrm
function conforms to
.St -ansiC ,
and
.Fn strxfrm_l
to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn strxfrm
function has been available since
.Bx 4.3 Reno ,
and
.Fn strxfrm_l
since
.Ox 6.2 .
