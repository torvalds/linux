.Sh NAME
.Nm killpg
.Nd send signal to a process group
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In signal.h
.Ft int
.Fn killpg "pid_t pgrp" "int sig"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn killpg
function sends the signal
.Fa sig
to the process group
.Fa pgrp .
See
.Xr sigaction 2
for a list of signals.
If
.Fa pgrp
is 0,
.Fn killpg
sends the signal to the sending process's process group.
.Pp
The sending process and members of the process group must
have the same effective user ID, or
the sender must be the superuser.
As a single special case the continue signal SIGCONT may be sent
to any process with the same session ID as the caller.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn killpg
will fail and no signal will be sent if:
.Bl -tag -width Er

.Fa pgrp .
.It Bq Er ESRCH
The process group was given as 0
but the sending process does not have a process group.
.It Bq Er EPERM

of the target processes has an effective user ID different from that
of the sending process.
