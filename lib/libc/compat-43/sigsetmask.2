.Dt SIGSETMASK 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sigsetmask ,
.Nm sigblock
.Nd manipulate current signal mask
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In signal.h
.Ft int
.Fn sigsetmask "int mask"
.Ft int
.Fn sigblock "int mask"
.Ft int
.Fn sigmask "int signum"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This interface is made obsolete by:
.Ef
.Xr sigprocmask 2 .
.Pp
The
.Fn sigsetmask
function
sets the current signal mask to the specified
.Fa mask .
Signals are blocked from delivery if the corresponding bit in
.Fa mask
is a 1.
The
.Fn sigblock
function
adds the signals in the specified
.Fa mask
to the current signal mask,
rather than overwriting it as
.Fn sigsetmask
does.
The macro
.Fn sigmask
is provided to construct the mask for a given
.Fa signum .
.Pp
The system
quietly disallows
.Dv SIGKILL
or
.Dv SIGSTOP
to be blocked.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn sigblock
and
.Fn sigsetmask
functions
return the previous set of masked signals.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kill 2 ,
.Xr sigaction 2 ,
.Xr sigprocmask 2 ,
.Xr sigsuspend 2 ,
.Xr sigvec 2 ,
.Xr sigsetops 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn sigsetmask
and
.Fn sigblock
functions first appeared in
.Bx 4.2
and have been deprecated.
