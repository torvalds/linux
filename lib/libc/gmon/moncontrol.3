.Dt MONCONTROL 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm moncontrol
.Nd control execution profile
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/gmon.h
.Ft void
.Fn moncontrol "int mode"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
An executable program compiled using the
.Fl pg
option to
.Xr cc 1
automatically includes calls to collect statistics for the
.Xr gprof 1
call-graph execution profiler.
Profiling begins at program startup and ends when the program calls exit.
When the program exits, the profiling data are written to the file
.Em gmon.progname.pid.out ,
then
.Xr gprof 1
can be used to examine the results.
.Pp
.Fn moncontrol
selectively controls profiling within a program.
When the program starts, profiling begins.
To stop the collection of histogram ticks and call counts use
.Fn moncontrol 0 ;
to resume the collection of histogram ticks and call counts use
.Fn moncontrol 1 .
This feature allows the cost of particular operations to be measured.
Note that an output file will be produced on program exit
regardless of the state of
.Fn moncontrol .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width gmon.progname.pid.out -compact
.It Pa gmon.progname.pid.out

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cc 1 ,
.Xr gprof 1 ,
.Xr profil 2
.Sh CAVEATS
Do not call
.Fn moncontrol 0
if
.Xr pthread_create 3
will be called subsequently.
While profiling is stopped,
.Xr pthread_create 3
does not allocate the collection buffer for the new thread.
This cannot be recovered by
.Fn moncontrol 1 ,
resulting in failure to collect the statistics for those threads.
