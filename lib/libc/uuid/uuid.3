.Sh DESCRIPTION
The family of DCE 1.1 compliant UUID functions allow applications to operate
on universally unique identifiers, or UUIDs.
The
.Fn uuid_create
and
.Fn uuid_create_nil
functions create UUIDs.
The
.Fn uuid_compare ,
.Fn uuid_equal
and
.Fn uuid_is_nil
functions can be used to test UUIDs.
To convert from the binary representation to the string representation or
vice versa, use
.Fn uuid_to_string
or
.Fn uuid_from_string
respectively.
A 16-bit hash value can be obtained by calling
.Fn uuid_hash .
.Pp
The
.Fn uuid_to_string
function set
.Fa *str
to be a pointer to a buffer sufficiently large to hold the string.
This pointer should be passed to
.Xr free 3
to release the allocated storage when it is no longer needed.
.Pp
The
.Fn uuid_enc_le
and
.Fn uuid_enc_be
functions encode a binary representation of a UUID into an octet stream
in little-endian and big-endian byte-order, respectively.
The destination buffer must be pre-allocated by the caller, and must be
large enough to hold the 16-octet binary UUID.
These routines are not part of the DCE RPC API.
They are provided for convenience.
.Pp
The
.Fn uuid_dec_le
and
.Fn uuid_dec_be
functions decode a UUID from an octet stream in little-endian and
big-endian byte-order, respectively.
These routines are not part of the DCE RPC API.
They are provided for convenience.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The successful or unsuccessful completion of the function is returned in
the
.Fa status
argument.
Possible values are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv uuid_s_invalid_string_uuid"
.It Dv uuid_s_ok
The function completed successfully.
.It Dv uuid_s_bad_version
The UUID does not have a known version.
.It Dv uuid_s_invalid_string_uuid
The string representation of an UUID is not valid.
.It Dv uuid_s_no_memory
The function can not allocate memory to store an UUID representation.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr uuidgen 1 ,
.Xr uuidgen 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The UUID functions conform to the DCE 1.1 RPC specification.
.Sh BUGS
This manpage can be improved.
