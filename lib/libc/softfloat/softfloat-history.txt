Release 2a (1998 December)

-- Added functions to convert between 64-bit integers (int64) and all
   supported floating-point formats.

-- Fixed a bug in all 64-bit-version square root functions except
   `float32_sqrt' that caused the result sometimes to be off by 1 unit in
   the last place (1 ulp) from what it should be.  (Bug discovered by Paul
   Donahue.)

-- Improved the makefiles.

Release 2 (1997 June)

-- Created the 64-bit (bits64) version, adding the floatx80 and float128
   formats.

-- Changed the source directory structure, splitting the sources into a
   `bits32' and a `bits64' version.  Renamed `environment.h' to `milieu.h'
   (to avoid confusion with environment variables).

-- Fixed a small error that caused `float64_round_to_int' often to round the
   wrong way in nearest/even mode when the operand was between 2^20 and 2^21
   and halfway between two integers.

Release 1a (1996 July)

-- Corrected a mistake that caused borderline underflow cases not to raise
   the underflow flag when they should have.  (Problem reported by Doug
   Priest.)

-- Added the `float_detect_tininess' variable to control whether tininess is
   detected before or after rounding.
