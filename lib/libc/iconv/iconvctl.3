.Dt ICONVCTL 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm iconvctl
.Nd controlling and diagnostical facility for
.Xr iconv 3
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In iconv.h
.Ft int
.Fn iconvctl "iconv_t cd" "int request" "void *argument"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn iconvctl
function can retrieve or set specific conversion
setting from the
.Fa cd
conversion descriptor.
The
.Fa request
parameter specifies the operation to accomplish and
.Fa argument
is an operation-specific argument.
.Pp
The possible operations are the following:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It ICONV_TRIVIALP
In this case
.Fa argument
is an
.Ft int *
variable, which is set to 1 if the encoding is trivial one, i.e.
the input and output encodings are the same.
Otherwise, the variable will be 0.
.It ICONV_GET_TRANSLITERATE
Determines if transliteration is enabled.
The answer is stored in
.Fa argument ,
which is of
.Ft int * .
It will be set to 1 if this feature is enabled or set to 0 otherwise.
.It ICONV_SET_TRANSLITERATE
Enables transliteration if
.Fa argument ,
which is of
.Ft int *
set to 1 or disables it if
.Fa argument
is set to 0.
.It ICONV_GET_DISCARD_ILSEQ
Determines if illegal sequences are discarded or not.
The answer is stored in
.Fa argument ,
which is of
.Ft int * .
It will be set to 1 if this feature is enabled or set to 0 otherwise.
.It ICONV_SET_DISCARD_ILSEQ
Sets whether illegal sequences are discarded or not.
.Fa argument ,
which is of
.Ft int *
set to 1 or disables it if
.Fa argument
is set to 0.
.It ICONV_SET_HOOKS
Sets callback functions, which will be called back after successful
conversions.
The callback functions are stored in a
.Ft struct iconv_hooks
variable, which is passed to
.Nm
via
.Fa argument
by its address.
.It ICONV_GET_ILSEQ_INVALID
Determines if a character in the input buffer that is valid,
but for which an identical character does not exist in the target
codeset returns
.Er EILSEQ
or not.
The answer is stored in
.Fa argument ,
which is of
.Ft int * .
It will be set to 1 if this feature is enabled or set to 0 otherwise.
.It ICONV_SET_ILSEQ_INVALID
Sets whether a character in the input buffer that is valid,
but for which an identical character does not exist in the target
codeset returns
.Er EILSEQ
or not.
If
.Fa argument ,
which is of
.Ft int *
is set to 1 it will be enabled,
and if
.Fa argument
is set to 0 it will be disabled.
.El
.\" XXX: fallbacks are unimplemented and trying to set them will always
.\"      return EOPNOTSUPP but definitions are provided for source-level
.\"      compatibility.
.\".It ICONV_SET_FALLBACKS
.\"Sets callback functions, which will be called back after failed
.\"conversions.
.\"The callback functions are stored in a
.\".Ft struct iconv_fallbacks
.\"variable, which is passed to
.\".Nm
.\"via
.\".Fa argument
.\"by its address.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion
.Fn iconvctl ,
returns 0.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and errno is set to
specify the kind of error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn iconvctl
function may cause an error in the following cases:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Unknown or unimplemented operation.
.It Bq Er EBADF
The conversion descriptor specified by
.Fa cd
is invalid.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr iconv 1 ,
.Xr iconv 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
facility is a non-standard extension, which appeared in
the GNU implementation and was adopted in
.Fx 9.0
for compatibility's sake.

.An Gabor Kovesdan Aq Mt gabor@FreeBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
Transliteration is enabled in this implementation by default, so it
is impossible by design to turn it off.
Accordingly, trying to turn it off will always fail and \-1 will be
returned.
Getting the transliteration state will always succeed and indicate
that it is turned on, though.
