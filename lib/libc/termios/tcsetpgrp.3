.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tcsetpgrp
.Nd set foreground process group ID
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn tcsetpgrp "int fd" "pid_t pgrp_id"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
If the process has a controlling terminal, the
.Fn tcsetpgrp
function sets the foreground process group ID associated with the
terminal device to
.Fa pgrp_id .
The terminal device associated with
.Fa fd
must be the controlling terminal of the calling process and the
controlling terminal must be currently associated with the session
of the calling process.
The value of
.Fa pgrp_id
must be the same as the process group ID of a process in the same
session as the calling process.
.Pp
If the calling process is a member of a background process group,
the process group will be sent a
.Dv SIGTTOU
signal.
If the calling process is blocking or ignoring
.Dv SIGTTOU
signals, the process is allowed to perform the operation and the
.Dv SIGTTOU
signal is not sent.
.Pp
Upon successful completion,
.Fn tcsetpgrp
returns a value of zero.
.Sh ERRORS
If an error occurs,
.Fn tcsetpgrp
returns \-1 and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error, as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The
.Fa fd
argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EINTR
The
.Fn tcsetpgrp
function was interrupted by a signal.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An invalid value of
.Fa pgrp_id
was specified.
.It Bq Er ENOTTY
The calling process does not have a controlling terminal, or the file
represented by
.Fa fd
is not the controlling terminal, or the controlling terminal is no
longer associated with the session of the calling process.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The
.Fa pgrp_id
argument does not match the process group ID of a process in the same
session as the calling process.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn tcsetpgrp
function is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-88
specification.
