 * Return the current FP rounding mode
 *
 * Returns:
 *	0 - round to zero
 *	1 - round to nearest
 *	2 - round to positive infinity
 *	3 - round to negative infinity
 *
 * ok all we need to do is get the current FP rounding mode
 * index our map table and return the appropriate value.
 *
 * HOWEVER:
 * The ARM FPA codes the rounding mode into the actual FP instructions
 * so there is no such thing as a global rounding mode.
 * The default is round to nearest if rounding is not explicitly specified.
 * FP instructions generated by GCC will not explicitly specify a rounding
 * mode.
 *
 * So the best we can do it to return the rounding mode FP instructions
 * use if rounding is not specified which is round to nearest.
 *
 * This could change in the future with new floating point emulators or
 * soft float FP libraries.
