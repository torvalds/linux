/*
 * Our task is to calculate the square root of a floating point number x0.
 * This number x normally has the form:
 *
 *		    exp
 *	x = mant * 2		(where 1 <= mant < 2 and exp is an integer)
 *
 * This can be left as it stands, or the mantissa can be doubled and the
 * exponent decremented:
 *
 *			  exp-1
 *	x = (2 * mant) * 2	(where 2 <= 2 * mant < 4)
 *
 * If the exponent `exp' is even, the square root of the number is best
 * handled using the first form, and is by definition equal to:
 *
 *				exp/2
 *	sqrt(x) = sqrt(mant) * 2
 *
 * If exp is odd, on the other hand, it is convenient to use the second
 * form, giving:
 *
 *				    (exp-1)/2
 *	sqrt(x) = sqrt(2 * mant) * 2
 *
 * In the first case, we have
 *
 *	1 <= mant < 2
 *
 * and therefore
 *
 *	sqrt(1) <= sqrt(mant) < sqrt(2)
 *
 * while in the second case we have
 *
 *	2 <= 2*mant < 4
 *
 * and therefore
 *
 *	sqrt(2) <= sqrt(2*mant) < sqrt(4)
 *
 * so that in any case, we are sure that
 *
 *	sqrt(1) <= sqrt(n * mant) < sqrt(4),	n = 1 or 2
 *
 * or
 *
 *	1 <= sqrt(n * mant) < 2,		n = 1 or 2.
 *
 * This root is therefore a properly formed mantissa for a floating
 * point number.  The exponent of sqrt(x) is either exp/2 or (exp-1)/2
 * as above.  This leaves us with the problem of finding the square root
 * of a fixed-point number in the range [1..4).
 *
 * Though it may not be instantly obvious, the following square root
 * algorithm works for any integer x of an even number of bits, provided
 * that no overflows occur:
 *
 *	let q = 0
 *	for k = NBITS-1 to 0 step -1 do -- for each digit in the answer...
 *		x *= 2			-- multiply by radix, for next digit
 *		if x >= 2q + 2^k then	-- if adding 2^k does not
 *			x -= 2q + 2^k	-- exceed the correct root,
 *			q += 2^k	-- add 2^k and adjust x
 *		fi
 *	done
 *	sqrt = q / 2^(NBITS/2)		-- (and any remainder is in x)
 *
 * If NBITS is odd (so that k is initially even), we can just add another
 * zero bit at the top of x.  Doing so means that q is not going to acquire
 * a 1 bit in the first trip around the loop (since x0 < 2^NBITS).  If the
 * final value in x is not needed, or can be off by a factor of 2, this is
 * equivalent to moving the `x *= 2' step to the bottom of the loop:
 *
 *	for k = NBITS-1 to 0 step -1 do if ... fi; x *= 2; done
 *
 * and the result q will then be sqrt(x0) * 2^floor(NBITS / 2).
 * (Since the algorithm is destructive on x, we will call x's initial
 * value, for which q is some power of two times its square root, x0.)
 *
 * If we insert a loop invariant y = 2q, we can then rewrite this using
 * C notation as:
 *
 *	q = y = 0; x = x0;
 *	for (k = NBITS; --k >= 0;) {
 * #if (NBITS is even)
 *		x *= 2;
 * #endif
 *		t = y + (1 << k);
 *		if (x >= t) {
 *			x -= t;
 *			q += 1 << k;
 *			y += 1 << (k + 1);
 *		}
 * #if (NBITS is odd)
 *		x *= 2;
 * #endif
 *	}
 *
 * If x0 is fixed point, rather than an integer, we can simply alter the
 * scale factor between q and sqrt(x0).  As it happens, we can easily arrange
 * for the scale factor to be 2**0 or 1, so that sqrt(x0) == q.
 *
 * In our case, however, x0 (and therefore x, y, q, and t) are multiword
 * integers, which adds some complication.  But note that q is built one
 * bit at a time, from the top down, and is not used itself in the loop
 * (we use 2q as held in y instead).  This means we can build our answer
 * in an integer, one word at a time, which saves a bit of work.  Also,
 * since 1 << k is always a `new' bit in q, 1 << k and 1 << (k+1) are
 * `new' bits in y and we can set them with an `or' operation rather than
 * a full-blown multiword add.
 *
 * We are almost done, except for one snag.  We must prove that none of our
 * intermediate calculations can overflow.  We know that x0 is in [1..4)
 * and therefore the square root in q will be in [1..2), but what about x,
 * y, and t?
 *
 * We know that y = 2q at the beginning of each loop.  (The relation only
 * fails temporarily while y and q are being updated.)  Since q < 2, y < 4.
 * The sum in t can, in our case, be as much as y+(1<<1) = y+2 < 6, and.
 * Furthermore, we can prove with a bit of work that x never exceeds y by
 * more than 2, so that even after doubling, 0 <= x < 8.  (This is left as
 * an exercise to the reader, mostly because I have become tired of working
 * on this comment.)
 *
 * If our floating point mantissas (which are of the form 1.frac) occupy
 * B+1 bits, our largest intermediary needs at most B+3 bits, or two extra.
 * In fact, we want even one more bit (for a carry, to avoid compares), or
 * three extra.  There is a comment in fpu_emu.h reminding maintainers of
 * this, so we have some justification in assuming it.
