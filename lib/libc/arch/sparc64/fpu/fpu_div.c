/*
 * Division of normal numbers is done as follows:
 *
 * x and y are floating point numbers, i.e., in the form 1.bbbb * 2^e.
 * If X and Y are the mantissas (1.bbbb's), the quotient is then:
 *
 *	q = (X / Y) * 2^((x exponent) - (y exponent))
 *
 * Since X and Y are both in [1.0,2.0), the quotient's mantissa (X / Y)
 * will be in [0.5,2.0).  Moreover, it will be less than 1.0 if and only
 * if X < Y.  In that case, it will have to be shifted left one bit to
 * become a normal number, and the exponent decremented.  Thus, the
 * desired exponent is:
 *
 *	left_shift = x->fp_mant < y->fp_mant;
 *	result_exp = x->fp_exp - y->fp_exp - left_shift;
 *
 * The quotient mantissa X/Y can then be computed one bit at a time
 * using the following algorithm:
 *
 *	Q = 0;			-- Initial quotient.
 *	R = X;			-- Initial remainder,
 *	if (left_shift)		--   but fixed up in advance.
 *		R *= 2;
 *	for (bit = FP_NMANT; --bit >= 0; R *= 2) {
 *		if (R >= Y) {
 *			Q |= 1 << bit;
 *			R -= Y;
 *		}
 *	}
 *
 * The subtraction R -= Y always removes the uppermost bit from R (and
 * can sometimes remove additional lower-order 1 bits); this proof is
 * left to the reader.
 *
 * This loop correctly calculates the guard and round bits since they are
 * included in the expanded internal representation.  The sticky bit
 * is to be set if and only if any other bits beyond guard and round
 * would be set.  From the above it is obvious that this is true if and
 * only if the remainder R is nonzero when the loop terminates.
 *
 * Examining the loop above, we can see that the quotient Q is built
 * one bit at a time ``from the top down''.  This means that we can
 * dispense with the multi-word arithmetic and just build it one word
 * at a time, writing each result word when it is done.
 *
 * Furthermore, since X and Y are both in [1.0,2.0), we know that,
 * initially, R >= Y.  (Recall that, if X < Y, R is set to X * 2 and
 * is therefore at in [2.0,4.0).)  Thus Q is sure to have bit FP_NMANT-1
 * set, and R can be set initially to either X - Y (when X >= Y) or
 * 2X - Y (when X < Y).  In addition, comparing R and Y is difficult,
 * so we will simply calculate R - Y and see if that underflows.
 * This leads to the following revised version of the algorithm:
 *
 *	R = X;
 *	bit = FP_1;
 *	D = R - Y;
 *	if (D >= 0) {
 *		result_exp = x->fp_exp - y->fp_exp;
 *		R = D;
 *		q = bit;
 *		bit >>= 1;
 *	} else {
 *		result_exp = x->fp_exp - y->fp_exp - 1;
 *		q = 0;
 *	}
 *	R <<= 1;
 *	do  {
 *		D = R - Y;
 *		if (D >= 0) {
 *			q |= bit;
 *			R = D;
 *		}
 *		R <<= 1;
 *	} while ((bit >>= 1) != 0);
 *	Q[0] = q;
 *	for (i = 1; i < 4; i++) {
 *		q = 0, bit = 1U << 31;
 *		do {
 *			D = R - Y;
 *			if (D >= 0) {
 *				q |= bit;
 *				R = D;
 *			}
 *			R <<= 1;
 *		} while ((bit >>= 1) != 0);
 *		Q[i] = q;
 *	}
 *
 * This can be refined just a bit further by moving the `R <<= 1'
 * calculations to the front of the do-loops and eliding the first one.
 * The process can be terminated immediately whenever R becomes 0, but
 * this is relatively rare, and we do not bother.
