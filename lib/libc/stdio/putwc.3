.Ft wint_t
.Fn fputwc "wchar_t wc" "FILE *stream"
.Ft wint_t
.Fn putwc "wchar_t wc" "FILE *stream"
.Ft wint_t

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fputwc
function
writes the wide character
.Fa wc
to the output stream pointed to by
.Fa stream .
.Pp
.Fn putwc
acts essentially identically to
.Fn fputwc ,
but is a macro that expands in-line.
It may evaluate
.Fa stream
more than once, so arguments given to
.Fn putwc
should not be expressions with potential side effects.
.Pp
.Fn putwchar
is identical to
.Fn putwc
with an output stream of
.Em stdout .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The functions,
.Fn fputwc ,
.Fn putwc
and
.Fn putwchar
return the wide character written.
If an error occurs, the value
.Dv WEOF
is returned.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ferror 3 ,
.Xr fopen 3 ,
.Xr getwc 3 ,
.Xr putc 3 ,
.Xr stdio 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The functions
.Fn fputwc ,
.Fn putwc ,
and

conform to
