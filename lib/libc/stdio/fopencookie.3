.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function
associates a stream with up to four
.Dq Tn I/O No functions .
These
.Tn I/O
functions will be used to read, write, seek and
close the new stream.
.Pp
In general, omitting a function means that any attempt to perform the
associated operation on the resulting stream will fail.
If the write function is omitted, data written to the stream is discarded.
If the close function is omitted, closing the stream will flush
any buffered output and then succeed.
.Pp
The calling conventions of
.Fa read ,
.Fa write ,
and
.Fa close
must match those, respectively, of
.Xr read 2 ,
.Xr write 2 ,
and
.Xr close 2
with the single exception that they are passed the
.Fa cookie
argument specified to
.Nm
in place of the traditional file descriptor argument.
The
.Fa seek
function updates the current stream offset using
.Fa *offset
and
.Fa whence .
If
.Fa *offset
is non-NULL, it updates
.Fa *offset
with the current stream offset.
.Pp
.Nm
is implemented as a thin shim around the
.Xr funopen 3
interface.
Limitations, possibilities, and requirements of that interface apply to
.Nm .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Nm
returns a
.Dv FILE
pointer.
Otherwise,
.Dv NULL
is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
A bogus
.Fa mode
was provided to
.Nm .
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The
.Nm
function
may fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors
specified for the
.Xr malloc 3
routine.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn funopen
functions first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
The
.Nm
function first appeared in
.Fx 11 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
function is a nonstandard glibc extension and may not be portable to systems
other than
.Fx
and Linux.
