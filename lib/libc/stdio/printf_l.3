.Sh DESCRIPTION
The above functions are used to convert formatted output in the locale
.Fa loc .
They behave in the same way as the versions without the _l suffix, but use
the specified locale rather than the global or per-thread locale.
See the specific manual pages for more information.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr printf 3 ,
.Xr xlocale 3
.Sh STANDARDS
These functions do not conform to any specific standard so they should be
considered as non-portable local extensions.
.Sh HISTORY
These functions first appeared in Darwin and were first implemented in
.Fx 9.1 .
