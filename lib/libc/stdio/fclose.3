.Dt FCLOSE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fclose ,
.Nm fdclose
.Nd close a stream
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdio.h
.Ft int
.Fn fclose "FILE *stream"
.Ft int
.Fn fdclose "FILE *stream" "int *fdp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fclose
function dissociates the named
.Fa stream
from its underlying file or set of functions.
If the stream was being used for output then any buffered data is written
first,
while if the stream was being used for input then the underlying
file position may be updated,
as if via
.Xr fflush 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn fdclose
function is equivalent to
.Fn fclose
except that it does not close the associated file descriptor.
If
.Fa fdp
is not
.Dv NULL ,
the file descriptor will be stored through it.
If the stream was created with a function other than
.Xr fopen 3 ,
.Xr fdopen 3 ,
or
.Xr freopen 3
and as a result does not have an associated file descriptor then
-1 will stored through
.Fa fdp .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise,
.Dv EOF
is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
In either case no further access to the stream is possible.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn fclose
and
.Fn fdclose
functions will fail if
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
The argument
.Fa stream
is not an open stream.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn fdclose
function will fail if
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EOPNOTSUPP
The argument
.Fa stream
does not have an associated file descriptor.
.El
.Pp
They may also fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the
.Xr fflush 3
routine.
.Pp
The
.Fn fclose
function may also fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the
.Xr close 2
routine.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr close 2 ,
.Xr fflush 3 ,
.Xr fopen 3 ,
.Xr setvbuf 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn fclose
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2024 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn fclose
function first appeared in
.At v7 .
.Pp
The
.Fn fdclose
function first appeared in
.Fx 11.0 .
