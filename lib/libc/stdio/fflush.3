For output streams this discards any unwritten output.
For input streams this discards any input read from the underlying object
but not yet obtained via
.Xr getc 3 ;
this includes any text pushed back via
.Xr ungetc 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES

.Dv EOF
is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.

returns 0.
