.Nd stream extension functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdio_ext.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn __fpending "FILE *stream"
.Ft size_t
.Fn __freadahead "FILE *stream"
.Ft int
.Fn __freading "FILE *stream"
.Ft const char *
.Fn __freadptr "FILE *stream" "size_t *sizep"
.Ft void
.Fn __freadptrinc "FILE *stream" "size_t increment"
.Ft void
.Fn __fseterr "FILE *stream"
.Ft int
.Fn __fwriting "FILE *stream"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn __fpending
function returns the number of bytes of output data currently
buffered on
.Fa stream .
.Pp
The
.Fn __freadahead
function returns the number of bytes of input data currently
buffered on
.Fa stream .
.Pp
The
.Fn __freading
function returns non-zero if
.Fa stream
either was opened read-only or if the last operation on the stream
was a read or push-back operation.
.Pp
The
.Fn __freadptr
function returns either a pointer to the next byte of buffered input
data on
.Fa stream
and stores the number of consecutive bytes of buffered data available
to the location pointed to by
.Fa sizep ,
or return
.Dv NULL
if there's no buffered input data.
The value returned via
.Fa sizep
may differ from the value that would be returned by
.Fn __freadahead .
.Pp
The
.Fn __freadptrinc
function consumes
.Fa increment
bytes of buffered input data on
.Fa stream .
This is only valid immediately after a non-NULL return from
.Fn __freadptr
and
.Fa increment
must not be greater than the size value from that call.
.Pp
The
.Fn __fseterr
function sets the error indicator for
.Fa stream .
.Pp
The
.Fn __fwriting
function returns non-zero if
.Fa stream
either was opened write-only or append-only or if the last operation
on the stream was a write operation.
.Sh ERRORS
These functions should not fail and do not set the external
variable
.Va errno .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fflush 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn __fpending ,
.Fn __freadahead ,
.Fn __freading ,
.Fn __freadptr ,
.Fn __freadptrinc ,
.Fn __fseterr ,
and
.Fn __fwriting
functions appeared in
.Ox 7.6 .
.Sh BUGS
These functions are under-specified and non-portable.
They exist to permit a particular
.Dq portability
library to function without direct manipulation of stdio structures;
everyone else should either implement their own stdio layer,
do the work of defining and standardizing the required functionality,
or reconsider their life decisions.
