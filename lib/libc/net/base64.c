/* (From RFC1521 and draft-ietf-dnssec-secext-03.txt)
   The following encoding technique is taken from RFC 1521 by Borenstein
   and Freed.  It is reproduced here in a slightly edited form for
   convenience.

   A 65-character subset of US-ASCII is used, enabling 6 bits to be
   represented per printable character. (The extra 65th character, "=",
   is used to signify a special processing function.)

   The encoding process represents 24-bit groups of input bits as output
   strings of 4 encoded characters. Proceeding from left to right, a
   24-bit input group is formed by concatenating 3 8-bit input groups.
   These 24 bits are then treated as 4 concatenated 6-bit groups, each
   of which is translated into a single digit in the base64 alphabet.

   Each 6-bit group is used as an index into an array of 64 printable
   characters. The character referenced by the index is placed in the
   output string.

   Special processing is performed if fewer than 24 bits are available
   at the end of the data being encoded.  A full encoding quantum is
   always completed at the end of a quantity.  When fewer than 24 input
   bits are available in an input group, zero bits are added (on the
   right) to form an integral number of 6-bit groups.  Padding at the
   end of the data is performed using the '=' character.

   Since all base64 input is an integral number of octets, only the
         -------------------------------------------------
   following cases can arise:

       (1) the final quantum of encoding input is an integral
           multiple of 24 bits; here, the final unit of encoded
	   output will be an integral multiple of 4 characters
	   with no "=" padding,
       (2) the final quantum of encoding input is exactly 8 bits;
           here, the final unit of encoded output will be two
	   characters followed by two "=" padding characters, or
       (3) the final quantum of encoding input is exactly 16 bits;
           here, the final unit of encoded output will be three
	   characters followed by one "=" padding character.
