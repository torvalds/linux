.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn gethostbyname ,
.Fn gethostbyname2 ,
and
.Fn gethostbyaddr
functions each return a pointer to an object with the following structure
describing an Internet host referenced by
.Fa name
or
.Fa addr ,
respectively.
This structure contains either information obtained from a name server,
broken-out fields from a line in
.Pa /etc/hosts ,
or database entries supplied by the
.Xr yp 8
system.
.Xr resolv.conf 5
describes how the particular database is chosen.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct	hostent {
	char	*h_name;	/* official name of host */
	char	**h_aliases;	/* alias list */
	int	h_addrtype;	/* host address type */
	int	h_length;	/* length of address */
	char	**h_addr_list;	/* list of returned addresses */
};
#define	h_addr  h_addr_list[0]	/* address, for backward compat */
.Ed
.Pp
The members of this structure are:
.Bl -tag -width h_addr_list
.It Fa h_name
Official name of the host.
.It Fa h_aliases
A
.Dv NULL Ns -terminated
array of alternate names for the host.
.It Fa h_addrtype
The type of address being returned.
.It Fa h_length
The length, in bytes, of the address.
.It Fa h_addr_list
A
.Dv NULL Ns -terminated
array of network addresses for the host.
Host addresses are returned in network byte order.
.It Fa h_addr
The first address in
.Fa h_addr_list ;
this is for backward compatibility.
.El
.Pp
The function
.Fn gethostbyname
will search for the named host in the current domain and its parents
using the search lookup semantics detailed in
.Xr resolv.conf 5
and
.Xr hostname 7 .
.Pp
.Fn gethostbyname2
is similar to
.Fn gethostbyname
except that it supports an
.Fa af
of
.Dv AF_INET6
in addition to
.Dv AF_INET .
.Pp
The
.Fn gethostbyaddr
function will search for the specified address of length
.Fa len
in the address family
.Fa af .
The only address family supported is
.Dv AF_INET .
.Pp
The
.Fn sethostent ,
.Fn gethostent ,
and
.Fn endhostent
functions are deprecated and no longer have any effect.
They could be used in the past for queries over a persistent TCP
connection or to iterate entries in the
.Xr hosts 5
file.
.Pp
The
.Fn herror
function prints an error message describing the failure.
If its argument
.Fa string
is not
.Dv NULL ,
it is prepended to the message string and separated from it by a colon
.Pq Ql \&:
and a space.
The error message is printed with a trailing newline.
The contents of the error message is the same as that returned by
.Fn hstrerror
with argument
.Va h_errno .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width RES_OPTIONS
.It Ev RES_OPTIONS
A list of options to override the resolver's internal defaults.
See
.Xr resolv.conf 5
for more information.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/resolv.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/hosts
.It Pa /etc/resolv.conf
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Error return status from
.Fn gethostbyname ,
.Fn gethostbyname2 ,
and
.Fn gethostbyaddr
is indicated by return of a
.Dv NULL
pointer.
The external integer
.Va h_errno
may then be checked to see whether this is a temporary failure
or an invalid or unknown host.
.Pp
The variable
.Va h_errno
can have the following values:
.Bl -tag -width HOST_NOT_FOUND
.It Dv HOST_NOT_FOUND
No such host is known.
.It Dv TRY_AGAIN
This is usually a temporary error
and means that the local server did not receive
a response from an authoritative server.
A retry at some later time may succeed.
.It Dv NO_RECOVERY
Some unexpected server failure was encountered.
This is a non-recoverable error.
.It Dv NO_DATA
The requested name is valid but does not have an IP address;
this is not a temporary error.
This means that the name is known to the name server but there is no address
associated with this name.
Another type of request to the name server using this domain name
will result in an answer;
for example, a mail-forwarder may be registered for this domain.
.It Dv NETDB_INTERNAL
An internal error occurred.
This may occur when an address family other than
.Dv AF_INET
or
.Dv AF_INET6
is specified or when a resource is unable to be allocated.
It is always set by
.Fn gethostent .
.It Dv NETDB_SUCCESS
The function completed successfully.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn endhostent ,
.Fn gethostbyaddr ,
.Fn gethostbyname ,
.Fn gethostent ,
and
.Fn sethostent
functions appeared in
.Bx 4.1c .
The function
.Fn herror
was added in
.Bx 4.3 Tahoe ,
.Fn hstrerror
in
.Bx 4.4 ,
and
.Fn gethostbyname2
in
.Ox 2.1 .
.Sh BUGS
These functions use static data storage;
if the data is needed for future use, it should be
copied before any subsequent calls overwrite it.
.Pp
Only the Internet
address formats are currently understood.
.Pp
YP does not support any address families other than
.Dv AF_INET
and uses
the traditional database format.
