.Sh NAME
.Nm sctp_opt_info
.Nd get SCTP socket information
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/socket.h
.In netinet/sctp.h
.Ft int
.Fn sctp_opt_info "int sd" "sctp_assoc_t id" "int opt" "void *arg" "socklen_t *size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sctp_opt_info
call provides a multi-os compatible method for getting
specific
.Fn getsockopt
data where an association identification needs to be passed
into the operating system.
For
.Fx
a direct
.Fn getsockopt
may be used, since
.Fx
has the ability to pass information
into the operating system on a
.Fn getsockopt
call.
Other operating systems may not have this ability.
For those
who wish to write portable code amongst multiple operating systems
this call should be used for the following SCTP
socket options.

.Dv SCTP_RTOINFO
.Pp
.Dv SCTP_ASSOCINFO
.Pp
.Dv SCTP_PRIMARY_ADDR
.Pp
.Dv SCTP_PEER_ADDR_PARAMS

.Sh RETURN VALUES
The call returns 0 on success and -1 upon error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn sctp_opt_info
function can return the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The argument
.Fa arg
value was invalid.
.It Bq Er EOPNOTSUPP
The argument
.Fa opt
was not one of the above listed SCTP socket
options.
.It Bq Er EBADF
The argument
.Fa s
is not a valid descriptor.
.It Bq Er ENOTSOCK
The argument
.Fa s
is not a socket.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getsockopt 2 ,
.Xr sctp 4
.Sh BUGS
Because the structure used for
.Fa arg
of the
.Dv SCTP_MAX_BURST
socket option has changed in FreeBSD 9.0 and higher,
using
.Dv SCTP_MAX_BURST
as
.Fa opt
is only supported in FreeBSD 9.0 and higher.
