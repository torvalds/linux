.Sh DESCRIPTION
These routines convert 16, 32 and 64-bit quantities between different
byte orderings.
The
.Dq swap
functions reverse the byte ordering of
the given quantity; the others convert either from/to the native
byte order used by the host to/from either little- or big-endian (a.k.a
network) order.
.Pp
Apart from the swap functions,
the names containing
.Dq be
convert between host and big-endian (most significant byte first) order
of the given quantity, while the names containing
.Dq le
convert between host and little-endian (least significant byte first) order
of the given quantity.
.Pp
All these functions use the numbers
16, 32, or 64 for specifying the bitwidth of the quantities they operate on.
Currently all supported architectures are either big- or little-endian
so either the
.Dq be
or
.Dq le
variants are implemented as null macros.

The
.Fn htobe64 ,
.Fn htobe32 ,

.Fn be64toh ,
.Fn be32toh ,

.Fn htole64 ,
.Fn htole32 ,
.Fn htole16 ,
.Fn le64toh ,
.Fn le32toh ,
and
.Fn le16toh
functions conform to
.St -p1003.1-2024 .
The other functions are extensions that should not be used
when portability is required.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm swap{size}
and
.Nm {src-order}to{dst-order}{size}
functions appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
The
.Nm {src-order}{size}to{dst-order}
functions appeared in
.Ox 5.6 .
.Sh BUGS
The perceived antagonism between
.Sq host
and
.Sq network
byte order does not allow PDP-11 users to sleep soundly at night.
