.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions operate on IEEE EUI-64s using an
.Vt eui64
structure, which is defined in the header file
.In sys/eui64.h :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/*
 * The number of bytes in an EUI-64.
 */
#define EUI64_LEN		8

/*
 * Structure of an IEEE EUI-64.
 */
struct  eui64 {
        u_char octet[EUI64_LEN];
};
.Ed
.\" .Pp
.\" The function
.\" .Fn eui64_line
.\" scans
.\" .Fa l ,
.\" an
.\" .Tn ASCII
.\" string in
.\" .Xr eui64 5
.\" format and sets
.\" .Fa e
.\" to the EUI-64 specified in the string and
.\" .Fa h
.\" to the hostname.
.\" This function is used to parse lines from
.\" .Pa /etc/eui64
.\" into their component parts.
.Pp
The
.Fn eui64_aton
function converts an
.Tn ASCII
representation of an EUI-64 into an
.Vt eui64
structure.
Likewise,
.Fn eui64_ntoa
converts an EUI-64 specified as an
.Vt eui64
structure into an
.Tn ASCII
string.
.Pp
The
.Fn eui64_ntohost
and
.Fn eui64_hostton
functions map EUI-64s to their corresponding hostnames
as specified in the
.Pa /etc/eui64
database.
The
.Fn eui64_ntohost
function
converts from EUI-64 to hostname, and
.Fn eui64_hostton
converts from hostname to EUI-64.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.\" The
.\" .Fn eui64_line
.\" function
.\" returns zero on success and non-zero if it was unable to parse
.\" any part of the supplied line
.\" .Fa l .
.\" It returns the extracted EUI-64 in the supplied
.\" .Vt eui64
.\" structure
.\" .Fa e
.\" and the hostname in the supplied string
.\" .Fa h .
.\" .Pp
On success,
.Fn eui64_ntoa
returns a pointer to a string containing an
.Tn ASCII
representation of an EUI-64.
If it is unable to convert
the supplied
.Vt eui64
structure, it returns a
.Dv NULL
pointer.
Likewise,
.Fn eui64_aton
returns a pointer to an
.Vt eui64
structure on success and a
.Dv NULL
pointer on failure.
.Pp
The
.Fn eui64_ntohost
and
.Fn eui64_hostton
functions both return zero on success or non-zero if they were
unable to find a match in the
.Pa /etc/eui64
database.
.Sh NOTES
The user must ensure that the hostname strings passed to the
.\" .Fn eui64_line ,
.Fn eui64_ntohost
and
.Fn eui64_hostton
functions are large enough to contain the returned hostnames.
.Sh NIS INTERACTION
If the
.Pa /etc/eui64
contains a line with a single
.Ql +
in it, the
.Fn eui64_ntohost
and
.Fn eui64_hostton
functions will attempt to consult the NIS
.Pa eui64.byname
and
.Pa eui64.byid
maps in addition to the data in the
.Pa /etc/eui64
file.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr firewire 4 ,
.Xr eui64 5 ,
.Xr yp 8
.Sh HISTORY
These functions first appears in
.Fx 5.3 .
They are derived from the
.Xr ethers 3
family of functions.
