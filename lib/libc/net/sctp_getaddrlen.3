.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sctp_getaddrlen
.Nd return the address length of an address family
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/socket.h
.In netinet/sctp.h
.Ft int
.Fn sctp_getaddrlen "sa_family_t family"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sctp_getaddrlen
function returns the size of a specific address family.
This function
is provided for application binary compatibility since it
provides the application with the size the operating system
thinks the specific address family is.
Note that the function
will actually create an SCTP socket and then gather the
information via a
.Fn getsockopt
system calls.
If for some reason a SCTP socket cannot
be created or the
.Fn getsockopt
call fails, an error will be returned
with
.Va errno
set as specified in the
.Fn socket
or
.Fn getsockopt
system call.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The call returns the number of bytes that the operating
system expects for the specific address family or -1.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn sctp_getaddrlen
function can return the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The address family specified does NOT exist.
