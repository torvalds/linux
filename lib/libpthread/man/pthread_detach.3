.Dt PTHREAD_DETACH 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread_detach
.Nd detach a thread
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libpthread
.In pthread.h
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_detach "pthread_t thread"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_detach
function is used to indicate to the implementation that storage for the
thread
.Fa thread
can be reclaimed when the thread terminates.
If
.Fa thread
has not terminated,
.Fn pthread_detach
will not cause it to terminate.
The effect of multiple
.Fn pthread_detach
calls on the same target thread is unspecified.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn pthread_detach
function will return zero.
Otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.
Note that the function does not change the value
of
.Va errno
as it did for some drafts of the standard.
These early drafts also passed a pointer to pthread_t as the argument.
Beware!
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn pthread_detach
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The implementation has detected that the value specified by
.Fa thread
does not refer to a joinable thread.
.It Bq Er ESRCH
No thread could be found corresponding to that specified by the given
thread ID,
.Fa thread .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pthread_join 3
.Sh STANDARDS
.Fn pthread_detach
conforms to
.St -p1003.1-96 .
