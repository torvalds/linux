/*
 * Variant of atomic_t specialized for reference counts.
 *
 * The interface matches the atomic_t interface (to aid in porting) but only
 * provides the few functions one should use for reference counting.
 *
 * It differs in that the counter saturates at UINT_MAX and will not move once
 * there. This avoids wrapping the counter and causing 'spurious'
 * use-after-free issues.
 *
 * Memory ordering rules are slightly relaxed wrt regular atomic_t functions
 * and provide only what is strictly required for refcounts.
 *
 * The increments are fully relaxed; these will not provide ordering. The
 * rationale is that whatever is used to obtain the object we're increasing the
 * reference count on will provide the ordering. For locked data structures,
 * its the lock acquire, for RCU/lockless data structures its the dependent
 * load.
 *
 * Do note that inc_not_zero() provides a control dependency which will order
 * future stores against the inc, this ensures we'll never modify the object
 * if we did not in fact acquire a reference.
 *
 * The decrements will provide release order, such that all the prior loads and
 * stores will be issued before, it also provides a control dependency, which
 * will order us against the subsequent free().
 *
 * The control dependency is against the load of the cmpxchg (ll/sc) that
 * succeeded. This means the stores aren't fully ordered, but this is fine
 * because the 1->0 transition indicates no concurrency.
 *
 * Note that the allocator is responsible for ordering things between free()
 * and alloc().
