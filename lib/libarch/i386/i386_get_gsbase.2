.Sh NAME
.Nm i386_get_gsbase ,
.Nm i386_set_gsbase
.Nd manage i386 per-thread %gs base address
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libi386
.In sys/types.h
.In machine/sysarch.h
.Ft int
.Fn i386_get_gsbase "void **base"
.Ft int
.Fn i386_set_gsbase "void *base"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn i386_get_gsbase
copies the current base address of the segment that, by default,
is referenced by the %gs selector into the memory referenced by
.Fa base .
.Pp
.Fn i386_set_gsbase
sets the base address of the segment that, by default, is referenced
by %gs to the address
.Fa base .
.Pp
The segment base address is local to each thread.
The initial thread of a new process inherits its segment base address
from the parent thread.
.Xr __tfork 3
sets the initial segment base address for threads that it creates.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn i386_get_gsbase
and
.Fn i386_set_gsbase
return 0.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn i386_get_gsbase
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width [EINVAL]
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa base
points outside the process's allocated address space.

.Sh WARNING
The ELF Thread-Local Storage ABI reserves %gs for its own use and
requires that the dynamic linker and thread library set it to
reference data-structures internal to and shared between them.
Programs should use the __thread storage class keyword instead of
using these calls.
To be maximally portable,
programs that require per-thread data should use the
.Fn pthread_key_create
interface.
