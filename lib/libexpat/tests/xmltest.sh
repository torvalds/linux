# EXPAT TEST SCRIPT FOR W3C XML TEST SUITE
#
# This script can be used to exercise Expat against the
# w3c.org xml test suite, available from:
# https://www.w3.org/XML/Test/xmlts20020606.zip
#
# To run this script, first set XMLWF below so that xmlwf can be
# found, then set the output directory with OUTPUT.
#
# The script lists all test cases where Expat shows a discrepancy
# from the expected result. Test cases where only the canonical
# output differs are prefixed with "Output differs:", and a diff file
# is generated in the appropriate subdirectory under $OUTPUT.
#
# If there are output files provided, the script will use
# output from xmlwf and compare the desired output against it.
# However, one has to take into account that the canonical output
# produced by xmlwf conforms to an older definition of canonical XML
# and does not generate notation declarations.
