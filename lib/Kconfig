config PACKING

	  This option provides the packing() helper function, which permits
	  converting bitfields between a CPU-usable representation and a
	  memory representation that can have any combination of these quirks:
	    - Is little endian (bytes are reversed within a 32-bit group)
	    - The least-significant 32-bit word comes first (within a 64-bit
	      group)
	    - The most significant bit of a byte is at its right (bit 0 of a
	      register description is numerically 2^7).
	  Drivers may use these helpers to match the bit indices as described
	  in the data sheets of the peripherals they are in control of.

	  On some platforms where no separate I/O space exists, there are I/O

	  mechanism, the host-local I/O resource can be mapped into system
	  logic PIO space shared with MMIO hosts, such as PCI/PCIe, then the
	  system can access the I/O devices with the mapped-logic PIO through
	  I/O accessors.

	  Doing so will enable extra compiler optimizations,
	  improving encoding and decoding performance up to 2x for
	  usual (m,t) values (typically such that m*t < 200).
	  When this option is selected, the BCH library supports
