.Sh NAME
.Nm RPCSEC_GSS
.Nd "GSS-API based authentication for RPC"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb librpcsec_gss
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In rpc/rpcsec_gss.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a security mechanism for the RPC protocol.
It uses the Generic Security Service API (GSS-API) to establish a
security context between a client and a server and to ensure that all
subsequent communication between client and server are properly
authenticated.
Optionally, extra protection can be applied to the connection.
The integrity service uses checksums to ensure that all data sent by
a peer is received without modification.
The privacy service uses encryption to ensure that no third party can
access the data for a connection.
.Pp
To use this system, an application must first use
.Fn rpc_gss_seccreate
to establish a security context.
.Sh DATA STRUCTURES
Data structures used by
.Nm
appear below.
.Bl -tag -width "MMMM"
.It Vt rpc_gss_service_t
This type defines the types of security service required for
.Fn rpc_gss_seccreate .
.Bd -literal
typedef enum {
	rpc_gss_svc_default	= 0,
	rpc_gss_svc_none	= 1,
	rpc_gss_svc_integrity	= 2,
	rpc_gss_svc_privacy	= 3
} rpc_gss_service_t;
.Ed
.It Vt rpc_gss_options_ret_t
This structure contains various optional values which are used while
creating a security context.
.Bd -literal
typedef struct {
	int		req_flags;	/* GSS request bits */
	int		time_req;	/* requested lifetime */
	gss_cred_id_t	my_cred;	/* GSS credential */
	gss_channel_bindings_t input_channel_bindings;
} rpc_gss_options_req_t;
.Ed
.It Vt rpc_gss_options_ret_t
Various details of the created security context are returned using
this structure.
.Bd -literal
typedef struct {
	int		major_status;
	int		minor_status;
	u_int		rpcsec_version;
	int		ret_flags;
	int		time_req;
	gss_ctx_id_t	gss_context;
	char		actual_mechanism[MAX_GSS_MECH];
} rpc_gss_options_ret_t;
.Ed
.It Vt rpc_gss_principal_t
This type is used to refer to an client principal which is represented
in GSS-API exported name form
(see
.Xr gss_export_name 3
for more details).
Names in this format may be stored in access control lists or compared
with other names in exported name form.
This structure is returned by
.Fn rpc_gss_get_principal_name
and is also referenced by the
.Vt rpc_gss_rawcred_t
structure.
.Bd -literal
typedef struct {
	int		len;
	char		name[1];
} *rpc_gss_principal_t;
.Ed
.It Vt rpc_gss_rawcred_t
This structure is used to access the raw credentials associated with a
security context.
.Bd -literal
typedef struct {
	u_int		version;	/* RPC version number */
	const char	*mechanism;	/* security mechanism */
	const char	*qop;		/* quality of protection */
	rpc_gss_principal_t client_principal; /* client name */
	const char	*svc_principal;	/* server name */
	rpc_gss_service_t service;	/* service type */
} rpc_gss_rawcred_t;
.Ed
.It Vt rpc_gss_ucred_t
Unix credentials which are derived form the raw credentials,
accessed via
.Fn rpc_gss_getcred .
.Bd -literal
typedef struct {
	uid_t		uid;		/* user ID */
	gid_t		gid;		/* group ID */
	short		gidlen;
	gid_t		*gidlist;	/* list of groups */
} rpc_gss_ucred_t;
.Ed
.It Vt rpc_gss_lock_t
Structure used to enforce a particular QOP and service.
.Bd -literal
typedef struct {
	bool_t		locked;
	rpc_gss_rawcred_t *raw_cred;
} rpc_gss_lock_t;
.Ed
.It Vt rpc_gss_callback_t
Callback structure used by
.Fn rpc_gss_set_callback .
.Bd -literal
typedef struct {
	u_int		program;	/* RPC program number */
	u_int		version;	/* RPC version number */
					/* user defined callback */
	bool_t		(*callback)(struct svc_req *req,
				    gss_cred_id_t deleg,
				    gss_ctx_id_t gss_context,
				    rpc_gss_lock_t *lock,
				    void **cookie);
} rpc_gss_callback_t;
.Ed
.It Vt rpc_gss_error_t
Structure used to return error information by
.Fn rpc_gss_get_error .
.Bd -literal
typedef struct {
	int		rpc_gss_error;
	int		system_error;	/* same as errno */
} rpc_gss_error_t;

/*
 * Values for rpc_gss_error
 */
#define RPC_GSS_ER_SUCCESS	0	/* no error */
#define RPC_GSS_ER_SYSTEMERROR	1	/* system error */
