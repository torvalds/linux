.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn bsde_add_rule
function fills the next available
rule (in
.Vt "struct mac_bsdextended_rule"
form, either from
.Fn bsde_get_rule
or
.Xr bsde_parse_rule 3 ) .
If an error occurs,
.Fa *errstr
is filled with the error string
(up to
.Fa errlen
characters, including the terminating
.Dv NUL ) .
If successful and
.Fa rulenum
is
.No non- Ns Dv NULL ,
the rule number used will be returned in
.Fa *rulenum .
.Pp
The
.Fn bsde_get_rule
function fills in
.Fa *rule
with the rule numbered
.Fa rulenum .
If an error occurs,
.Fa *errstr
is filled in with the error string
(up to
.Fa errlen
characters, including the terminating
.Dv NUL ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn bsde_set_rule
function fills the slot numbered
.Fa rulenum
with the specified rule
(in
.Vt "struct mac_bsdextended_rule"
form, either from
.Fn bsde_get_rule
or
.Xr bsde_parse_rule 3 ) .
If an error occurs,
.Fa *errstr
is filled with the error string
(up to
.Fa errlen
characters, including the terminating
.Dv NUL ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn bsde_delete_rule
function deletes the rule numbered
.Fa rulenum .
If an error occurs,
.Fa *errstr
is filled with the error string
(up to
.Fa errlen
characters, including the terminating
.Dv NUL ) .
