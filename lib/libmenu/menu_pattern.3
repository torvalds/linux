.TH menu_pattern 3 2023-07-01 "ncurses 6.4" "Library calls"
.SH NAME
\fBset_menu_pattern\fP,
\fBmenu_pattern\fP \- set and get a menu's pattern buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <menu.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint set_menu_pattern(MENU *\fImenu\fB, const char *\fIpattern\fB);\fR
.br
\fBchar *menu_pattern(const MENU *\fImenu\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Every menu has an associated pattern match buffer.
As input events that are
printable characters come in, they are appended to this match buffer
and tested for a match, as described in \fBmenu_driver\fP(3).
.PP
The function \fBset_menu_pattern\fP sets the pattern buffer for the given menu
and tries to find the first matching item.
If it succeeds, that item becomes
current; if not, the current item does not change.
.PP
The function \fBmenu_pattern\fP returns the pattern buffer of the given
\fImenu\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function \fBmenu_pattern\fP returns a pointer,
which is \fBNULL\fP if the \fImenu\fP parameter is \fBNULL\fP.
Otherwise, it is a pointer to a string which is empty
if no pattern has been set.
It does not set \fBerrno\fP.
.PP
The function \fBset_menu_pattern\fP may return the following error codes:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_STATE
Routine was called from an initialization or termination function.
.TP 5
.B E_NOT_CONNECTED
No items are connected to menu.
.TP 5
.B E_NO_MATCH
Character failed to match.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fP(3)).
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3), \fBmenu\fP(3).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fP automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fP.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V menu library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
