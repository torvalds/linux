.TH menu_spacing 3 2023-07-01 "ncurses 6.4" "Library calls"
.SH NAME
\fBset_menu_spacing\fP,
\fBmenu_spacing\fP \- set and get spacing between menu items.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <menu.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint set_menu_spacing(MENU *\fImenu\fB,\fR
                     \fBint \fIspc_description\fB,\fR
                     \fBint \fIspc_rows\fB,\fR
                     \fBint \fIspc_columns\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint menu_spacing(const MENU *\fImenu\fB,\fR
                 \fBint* \fIspc_description\fB,\fR
                 \fBint* \fIspc_rows\fB,\fR
                 \fBint* \fIspc_columns\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_menu_spacing\fP sets the spacing information for the menu.
Its parameter \fBspc_description\fP controls the number of spaces
between an item name and an item description.
It must not be larger than \fBTABSIZE\fP.
The menu system puts in the
middle of this spacing area the pad character.
The remaining parts are filled with
spaces.
The \fBspc_rows\fP parameter controls the number of rows
that are used for an item.
It must not be larger than 3.
The menu system inserts the blank lines between item rows, these lines
will contain the pad character in the appropriate positions.
The \fBspc_columns\fP parameter controls
the number of blanks between columns of items.
It must not be larger than \fBTABSIZE\fP.
A value of 0 for all the spacing values resets them to the default,
which is 1 for all of them.
.br
The function \fBmenu_spacing\fP passes back the spacing info for the menu.
If a
pointer is NULL, this specific info is simply not returned.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Both routines return \fBE_OK\fP on success.
\fBset_menu_spacing\fP may return
\fBE_POSTED\fP if the menu is posted, or \fBE_BAD_ARGUMENT\fP if one of the
spacing values is out of range.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3),
\fBcurs_variables\fP(3),
\fBmenu\fP(3).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fP automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fP.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines are specific to ncurses.
They were not supported on
Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.
It is recommended that
any code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
