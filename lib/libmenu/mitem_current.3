.SH NAME
\fBmitem_current\fP \- set and get current_menu_item
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <menu.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint set_current_item(MENU *\fImenu\fB, ITEM *\fIitem\fB);\fR
.br
\fBITEM *current_item(const MENU *\fImenu\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint set_top_row(MENU *\fImenu\fB, int \fIrow\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint top_row(const MENU *\fImenu\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint item_index(const ITEM *\fIitem\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_current_item\fP sets the current item (the item on which
the menu cursor is positioned).
\fBcurrent_item\fP returns a pointer to the
current item in the given menu.
.PP
The function \fBset_top_row\fP sets the top row of the menu to show the given
row (the top row is initially 0, and is reset to this value whenever the
\fBO_ROWMAJOR\fP option is toggled).
The item leftmost on the given row
becomes current.
The function \fBtop_row\fP returns the number of the top menu
row being displayed.
.PP
The function \fBitem_index\fP returns the (zero-origin) index of \fIitem\fP in
the menu's item pointer list.
.SH RETURN VALUE
\fBcurrent_item\fP returns a pointer (which may be \fBNULL\fP).
It does not set \fBerrno\fP.
.PP
\fBtop_row\fP and \fBitem_index\fP return \fBERR\fP (the general \fBcurses\fP
error value) if their \fImenu\fP parameter is \fBNULL\fP.
.PP
\fBset_current_item\fP and \fBset_top_row\fP return one of the following:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_STATE
Routine was called from an initialization or termination function.
.TP 5
.B E_NOT_CONNECTED
No items are connected to the menu.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fP(3)).
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3), \fBmenu\fP(3).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fP automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fP.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V menu library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
.PP
The SVr4 menu library documentation specifies the \fBtop_row\fP and
\fBindex_item\fP error value as \-1 (which is the value of \fBERR\fP).
