.TH menu_mark 3 2023-07-01 "ncurses 6.4" "Library calls"
.SH NAME
\fBset_menu_mark\fP,
\fBmenu_mark\fP \- get and set the menu mark string
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <menu.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint set_menu_mark(MENU *\fImenu\fB, const char *\fImark\fB);\fR
.br
\fBconst char *menu_mark(const MENU *\fImenu\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
In order to make menu selections visible on older terminals without
highlighting or color capability, the menu library marks selected items
in a menu with a prefix string.
.PP
The function \fBset_menu_mark\fP sets the mark string for the given menu.
Calling \fBset_menu_mark\fP with a null menu item will abolish the mark string.
Note that changing the length of the mark string for a menu while the
menu is posted is likely to produce unhelpful behavior.
.PP
The default string is "\-" (a dash).
Calling \fBset_menu_mark\fP with
a non-\fBNULL\fP menu argument will change this default.
.PP
The function \fBmenu_mark\fP returns the menu's mark string (or \fBNULL\fP if
there is none).
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function \fBmenu_mark\fP returns a pointer (which may be \fBNULL\fP).
It does not set \fBerrno\fP.
.PP
The function \fBset_menu_mark\fP may return the following error codes:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fP(3)).
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3), \fBmenu\fP(3).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fP automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fP.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V menu library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
.SH AUTHORS
Juergen Pfeifer.
