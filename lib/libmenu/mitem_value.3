.SH DESCRIPTION
If you turn off the menu option \fBO_ONEVALUE\fP (e.g., with

selected.

In a multi_valued menu, you can used \fBset_item_value\fP to select the
given menu item (second argument \fBTRUE\fP) or deselect it (second argument
\fBFALSE\fP).
.SH RETURN VALUE

.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR

.TP 5
.B E_REQUEST_DENIED
The menu driver could not process the request.
.SH SEE ALSO

.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fP automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fP.
