.Ss PMC Features
Intel Pentium 4 PMCs are 40 bits wide.
Each CPU contains 18 PMCs, divided into 4 groups with 4, 4, 4 and 6
PMCs respectively.
On processors with hyperthreading support, PMC resources are shared
between logical processors.
These PMCs support the following capabilities:
.Bl -column "PMC_CAP_INTERRUPT" "Support"
.It Em Capability Ta Em Support
.It PMC_CAP_CASCADE Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_EDGE Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_INTERRUPT Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_INVERT Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_READ Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_PRECISE Ta Unimplemented
.It PMC_CAP_SYSTEM Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_TAGGING Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_THRESHOLD Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_USER Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_WRITE Ta Yes
.El
.Ss Event Qualifiers
Event specifiers for Intel P4 PMCs can have the following common
qualifiers:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Li active= Ns Ar choice
(On P4 HTT CPUs) Filter event counting based on which logical
processors are active.
The allowed values of
.Ar choice
are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Li any
Count when either logical processor is active.
.It Li both
Count when both logical processors are active.
.It Li none
Count only when neither logical processor is active.
.It Li single
Count only when one logical processor is active.
.El
.Pp
The default is
.Dq Li both .
.It Li cascade
Configure the PMC to cascade onto its partner.
See
.Sx "Cascading P4 PMCs"
below for more information.
.It Li edge
Configure the counter to count false to true transitions of the threshold
comparison output.
This qualifier only takes effect if a threshold qualifier has also been
specified.
.It Li complement
Configure the counter to increment only when the event count seen is
less than the threshold qualifier value specified.
.It Li mask= Ns Ar qualifier
Many event specifiers for Intel P4 PMCs need to be additionally
qualified using a mask qualifier.
The allowed syntax for these qualifiers is event specific and is
described along with the events.
.It Li os
Configure the PMC to count when the CPL of the processor is 0.
.It Li precise
Select precise event based sampling.
Precise sampling is supported by the hardware for a limited set of
events.
.It Li tag= Ns Ar value
Configure the PMC to tag the internal uop selected by the other
fields in this event specifier with value
.Ar value .
This feature is used when cascading PMCs.
.It Li threshold= Ns Ar value
Configure the PMC to increment only when the event counts seen are
greater than the specified threshold value
.Ar value .
.It Li usr
Configure the PMC to count when the CPL of the processor is 1, 2 or 3.
.El
.Pp
If neither of the
.Dq Li os
or
.Dq Li usr
qualifiers are specified, the default is to enable both.
.Pp
On Intel Pentium 4 processors with HTT, events are
divided into two classes:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It "TS Events"
are those where hardware can differentiate between events
generated on one logical processor from those generated on the
other.
.It "TI Events"
are those where hardware cannot differentiate between events
generated by multiple logical processors in a package.
.El
.Pp
Only TS events are allowed for use with process-mode PMCs on
Pentium-4/HTT CPUs.
.Pp

.Ss "Cascading P4 PMCs"
PMC cascading support is currently poorly implemented.
While individual event counters may be allocated with a
.Dq Li cascade
qualifier, the current API does not offer the ability
to name and allocate all the resources needed for a
cascaded event counter pair in a single operation.
.Ss "Precise Event Based Sampling"
Support for precise event based sampling is currently
unimplemented.
.Ss Event Name Aliases
The following table shows the mapping between the PMC-independent
aliases supported by
