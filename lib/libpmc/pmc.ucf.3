.Sh NAME
.Nm pmc.ucf
.Nd measurement events for
.Tn Intel
uncore fixed function performance counters.
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpmc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pmc.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Each fixed-function PMC measures a specific hardware event.
The number of fixed-function PMCs implemented in a CPU can vary.
The number of fixed-function PMCs present can be determined at runtime
by using function
.Xr pmc_cpuinfo 3 .
.Pp
Intel uncore fixed-function PMCs are documented in
.Rs
.%B "Intel(R) 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developes Manual"
.%T "Volume 3B: System Programming Guide, Part 2"
.%N "Order Number: 253669-033US"
.%D December 2009
.%Q "Intel Corporation"

.Ss PMC Capabilities
Fixed-function PMCs support the following capabilities:
.Bl -column "PMC_CAP_INTERRUPT" "Support"
.It Em Capability Ta Em Support
.It PMC_CAP_CASCADE Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_EDGE Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_INTERRUPT Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_INVERT Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_READ Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_PRECISE Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_SYSTEM Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_TAGGING Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_THRESHOLD Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_USER Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_WRITE Ta Yes
.El
.Ss Class Name Prefix
These PMCs are named using a class name prefix of
.Dq Li ucf- .
.Ss Event Specifiers (Fixed Function PMCs)
The fixed function PMCs are selectable using the following
event names:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Li UCLOCK
.Pq Fixed Function Counter 0
The fixed-function uncore counter increments at the rate of the U-clock.
The frequency of the uncore clock domain can be determined from the uncore
clock ratio which is available in the PCI configuration space register at
offset C0H under device number 0 and Function 0.
