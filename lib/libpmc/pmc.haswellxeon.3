.In pmc.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn Intel
.Tn "Haswell"
CPUs contain PMCs conforming to version 2 of the
.Tn Intel
performance measurement architecture.
These CPUs may contain up to two classes of PMCs:
.Bl -tag -width "Li PMC_CLASS_IAP"
.It Li PMC_CLASS_IAF
Fixed-function counters that count only one hardware event per counter.
