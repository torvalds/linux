.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions retrieve information about performance monitoring
hardware.
.Pp
Function
.Fn pmc_capabilities
retrieves the hardware capabilities of a PMC.
Argument
.Fa pmc
is a PMC handle obtained by a prior call to
.Fn pmc_allocate .
The function sets argument
.Fa caps
to a bit mask of capabilities supported by the PMC denoted by
argument
.Fa pmc .
PMC capabilities are described in
.Xr pmc 3 .
.Pp
Function
.Fn pmc_cpuinfo
retrieves information about the CPUs in the system.
Argument
.Fa cpu_info
will be set to point to an internal structure with information about
the system's CPUs.
The caller should not free this pointer value.
This structure has the following fields:
.Bl -tag -width "pm_classes" -offset indent -compact
.It pm_cputype
Specifies the CPU type.
.It pm_ncpu
Specifies the number of CPUs in the system.
.It pm_npmc
Specifies the number of PMC rows per CPU.
.It pm_nclass
Specifies the number of distinct classes of PMCs in the system.
.It pm_classes
Contains an array of
.Vt "struct pmc_classinfo"
descriptors describing the properties of each class of PMCs
in the system.
.El
.Pp
Function
.Fn pmc_ncpu
is a convenience function that returns the maximum CPU number in
the system.
On systems that support sparsely numbered CPUs, not all CPUs may
be physically present.
Applications need to be prepared to deal with nonexistent CPUs.
.Pp
Function
.Fn pmc_npmc
is a convenience function that returns the number of PMCs available
in the CPU specified by argument
.Fa cpu .
.Pp
Function
.Fn pmc_pmcinfo
returns information about the current state of the PMC hardware
in the CPU specified by argument
.Fa cpu .
The location specified by argument
.Fa pmc_info
is set to point an array of
.Vt "struct pmc_info"
structures each describing the state of one PMC in the CPU.
These structure contain the following fields:
.Bl -tag -width pm_ownerpid -offset indent -compact
.It pm_name
A human readable name for the PMC.
.It pm_class
The PMC class for the PMC.
.It pm_enabled
Non-zero if the PMC is enabled.
.It pm_rowdisp
The disposition of the PMC row for this PMC.
Row dispositions are documented in
.Xr hwpmc 4 .
.It pm_ownerpid
If the hardware is in use, the process id of the owner of the PMC.
.It pm_mode
The PMC mode as described in
.Xr pmc 3 .
.It pm_event
If the hardware is in use, the PMC event being measured.
.It pm_flags
If the hardware is in use, the flags associated with the PMC.
.It pm_reloadcount
For sampling PMCs, the reload count associated with the PMC.
.El
.Pp
Function
.Fn pmc_width
is used to retrieve the width in bits of the hardware counters
associated with a PMC.
Argument
.Fa pmc
is a PMC handle obtained by a prior call to
.Fn pmc_allocate .
The function sets the location pointed to by argument
.Fa width
to the width of the physical counters associated with PMC
.Fa pmc .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Functions
.Fn pmc_ncpu
and
.Fn pmc_npmc
returns a positive integer if successful; otherwise the value -1 is
returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Pp
Functions
.Fn pmc_capabilities ,
.Fn pmc_cpuinfo ,
.Fn pmc_pmcinfo
and
.Fn pmc_width
return 0 if successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the
global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
A call to function
.Fn pmc_capabilities
may fail with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The argument to the function was invalid.
.El
.Pp
Calls to functions
.Fn pmc_cpuinfo ,
.Fn pmc_ncpu
and
.Fn pmc_npmc
may fail with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENXIO
A prior call to
.Fn pmc_init
to initialize the PMC library had failed.
.El
.Pp
A call to function
.Fn pmc_pmcinfo
may fail with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The argument
.Fa cpu
was invalid.
.It Bq Er ENXIO
The argument
.Fa cpu
specified a disabled or absent CPU.
.El
.Pp
A call to function
.Fn pmc_width
may fail with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The argument to the function was invalid.
