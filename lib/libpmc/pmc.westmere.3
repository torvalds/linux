.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn Intel
.Tn "Westmere"
CPUs contain PMCs conforming to version 2 of the
.Tn Intel
performance measurement architecture.
These CPUs may contain up to three classes of PMCs:

not allow new micro-ops to enter the out-of-order pipeline.
Note that, at
this stage in the pipeline, additional stalls may occur at the same cycle
and prevent the stalled micro-ops from entering the pipe.
In such a case,
micro-ops retry entering the execution pipe in the next cycle and the
ROB-read port stall is counted again.
.It Li RAT_STALLS.SCOREBOARD
.Pq Event D2H , Umask 08H
Counts the cycles where we stall due to microarchitecturally required
serialization.
Microcode scoreboarding stalls.
.It Li RAT_STALLS.ANY
.Pq Event D2H , Umask 0FH
Counts all Register Allocation Table stall cycles due to: Cycles when ROB
read port stalls occurred, which did not allow new micro-ops to enter the
execution pipe.
Cycles when partial register stalls occurred Cycles when
flag stalls occurred Cycles floating-point unit (FPU) status word stalls
occurred.
To count each of these conditions separately use the events:
RAT_STALLS.ROB_READ_PORT, RAT_STALLS.PARTIAL, RAT_STALLS.FLAGS, and
RAT_STALLS.FPSW.
.It Li SEG_RENAME_STALLS
.Pq Event D4H , Umask 01H
Counts the number of stall cycles due to the lack of renaming resources for
the ES, DS, FS, and GS segment registers.
If a segment is renamed but not
retired and a second update to the same segment occurs, a stall occurs in
the front- end of the pipeline until the renamed segment retires.
.It Li ES_REG_RENAMES
.Pq Event D5H , Umask 01H
Counts the number of times the ES segment register is renamed.
.It Li UOP_UNFUSION
.Pq Event DBH , Umask 01H

.It Li BR_INST_DECODED
.Pq Event E0H , Umask 01H

.It Li BPU_MISSED_CALL_RET
.Pq Event E5H , Umask 01H
Counts number of times the Branch Prediction Unit missed predicting a call
or return branch.
.It Li BACLEAR.CLEAR
.Pq Event E6H , Umask 01H
Counts the number of times the front end is resteered, mainly when the
Branch Prediction Unit cannot provide a correct prediction and this is
corrected by the Branch Address Calculator at the front end.
This can occur
if the code has many branches such that they cannot be consumed by the BPU.
Each BACLEAR asserted by the BAC generates approximately an 8 cycle bubble
in the instruction fetch pipeline.
The effect on total execution time depends on the surrounding code.
.It Li BACLEAR.BAD_TARGET
.Pq Event E6H , Umask 02H
Counts number of Branch Address Calculator clears (BACLEAR) asserted due to
conditional branch instructions in which there was a target hit but the
direction was wrong.
Each BACLEAR asserted by the BAC generates
approximately an 8 cycle bubble in the instruction fetch pipeline.
.It Li BPU_CLEARS.EARLY
.Pq Event E8H , Umask 01H
Counts early (normal) Branch Prediction Unit clears: BPU predicted a taken
branch after incorrectly assuming that it was not taken.
The BPU clear leads to 2 cycle bubble in the Front End.
.It Li BPU_CLEARS.LATE
.Pq Event E8H , Umask 02H
Counts late Branch Prediction Unit clears due to Most Recently Used
conflicts.
The PBU clear leads to a 3 cycle bubble in the Front End.
.It Li THREAD_ACTIVE
.Pq Event ECH , Umask 01H
Counts cycles threads are active.
.It Li L2_TRANSACTIONS.LOAD
.Pq Event F0H , Umask 01H

Counts L1D writeback operations to the L2.
.It Li L2_TRANSACTIONS.FILL
.Pq Event F0H , Umask 20H
Counts L2 cache line fill operations due to load, RFO, L1D writeback or
prefetch.
.It Li L2_TRANSACTIONS.WB
.Pq Event F0H , Umask 40H
Counts L2 writeback operations to the L3.
.It Li L2_TRANSACTIONS.ANY
.Pq Event F0H , Umask 80H
Counts all L2 cache operations.
.It Li L2_LINES_IN.S_STATE

state.
.It Li L2_LINES_IN.E_STATE

(exclusive) state.
