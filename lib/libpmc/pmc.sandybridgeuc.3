.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pmc.sandybridgeuc
.Nd uncore measurement events for
.Tn Intel
.Tn Sandy Bridge
family CPUs
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpmc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pmc.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn Intel
.Tn "Sandy Bridge"
CPUs contain PMCs conforming to version 3 of the
.Tn Intel
performance measurement architecture.
These CPUs contain two classes of PMCs:
.Bl -tag -width "Li PMC_CLASS_UCP"
.It Li PMC_CLASS_UCF
Fixed-function counters that count only one hardware event per counter.
.It Li PMC_CLASS_UCP
Programmable counters that may be configured to count one of a defined
set of hardware events.
.El
.Pp
The number of PMCs available in each class and their widths need to be
determined at run time by calling
.Xr pmc_cpuinfo 3 .
.Pp
Intel Sandy Bridge PMCs are documented in
.Rs
.%B "Intel(R) 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developers Manual"
.%T "Volume 3B: System Programming Guide, Part 2"
.%N "Order Number: 253669-039US"
.%D May 2011
.%Q "Intel Corporation"
.Re
.Ss SANDYBRIDGE UNCORE FIXED FUNCTION PMCS
These PMCs and their supported events are documented in
.Xr pmc.ucf 3 .
Not all CPUs in this family implement fixed-function counters.
.Ss SANDYBRIDGE UNCORE PROGRAMMABLE PMCS
The programmable PMCs support the following capabilities:
.Bl -column "PMC_CAP_INTERRUPT" "Support"
.It Em Capability Ta Em Support
.It PMC_CAP_CASCADE Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_EDGE Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_INTERRUPT Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_INVERT Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_READ Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_PRECISE Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_SYSTEM Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_TAGGING Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_THRESHOLD Ta Yes
.It PMC_CAP_USER Ta \&No
.It PMC_CAP_WRITE Ta Yes
.El
.Ss Event Qualifiers
Event specifiers for these PMCs support the following common
qualifiers:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Li cmask= Ns Ar value
Configure the PMC to increment only if the number of configured
events measured in a cycle is greater than or equal to
.Ar value .
.It Li edge
Configure the PMC to count the number of de-asserted to asserted
transitions of the conditions expressed by the other qualifiers.
If specified, the counter will increment only once whenever a
condition becomes true, irrespective of the number of clocks during
which the condition remains true.
.It Li inv
Invert the sense of comparison when the
.Dq Li cmask
qualifier is present, making the counter increment when the number of
events per cycle is less than the value specified by the
.Dq Li cmask
qualifier.
.El
