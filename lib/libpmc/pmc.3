.Sh NAME
.Nm pmc
.Nd library for accessing hardware performance monitoring counters
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpmc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pmc.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Lb libpmc
provides a programming interface that allows applications to use
hardware performance counters to gather performance data about
specific processes or for the system as a whole.
The library is implemented using the lower-level facilities offered by
the
.Xr hwpmc 4
driver.
.Ss Key Concepts
Performance monitoring counters (PMCs) are represented by the library
using a software abstraction.
These
.Dq abstract
PMCs can have two scopes:
.Bl -bullet
.It
System scope.
These PMCs measure events in a whole-system manner, i.e., independent
of the currently executing thread.
System scope PMCs are allocated on specific CPUs and do not
migrate between CPUs.
Non-privileged process are allowed to allocate system scope PMCs if the
.Xr hwpmc 4
sysctl tunable:
.Va security.bsd.unprivileged_syspmcs
is non-zero.
.It
Process scope.
These PMCs only measure hardware events when the processes they are
attached to are executing on a CPU.
In an SMP system, process scope PMCs migrate between CPUs along with
their target processes.
.El
.Pp
Orthogonal to PMC scope, PMCs may be allocated in one of two
operational modes:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Counting PMCs measure events according to their scope
(system or process).
The application needs to explicitly read these counters
to retrieve their value.
.It
Sampling PMCs cause the CPU to be periodically interrupted
and information about its state of execution to be collected.
Sampling PMCs are used to profile specific processes and kernel
threads or to profile the system as a whole.
.El
.Pp
The scope and operational mode for a software PMC are specified at
PMC allocation time.
An application is allowed to allocate multiple PMCs subject
to availability of hardware resources.
.Pp
The library uses human-readable strings to name the event being
measured by hardware.
The syntax used for specifying a hardware event along with additional
event specific qualifiers (if any) is described in detail in section
.Sx "EVENT SPECIFIERS"
below.
.Pp
PMCs are associated with the process that allocated them and
will be automatically reclaimed by the system when the process exits.
Additionally, process-scope PMCs have to be attached to one or more
target processes before they can perform measurements.
A process-scope PMC may be attached to those target processes
that its owner process would otherwise be permitted to debug.
An owner process may attach PMCs to itself allowing
it to measure its own behavior.
Additionally, on some machine architectures, such self-attached PMCs
may be read cheaply using specialized instructions supported by the
processor.
.Pp
Certain kinds of PMCs require that a log file be configured before
they may be started.
These include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
System scope sampling PMCs.
.It
Process scope sampling PMCs.
.It
Process scope counting PMCs that have been configured to report PMC
readings on process context switches or process exits.
.El
.Pp
Up to one log file may be configured per owner process.
Events logged to a log file may be subsequently analyzed using the
.Xr pmclog 3
family of functions.

processes that have PMCs allocated to them will be sent a

signal.

.Dv SIGIO
signal if:
.Bl -bullet
.It
If any process-mode PMC allocated by it loses all its
target processes.
.It
If the driver encounters an error when writing log data to a
configured log file.
This error may be retrieved by a subsequent call to
.Fn pmc_flush_logfile .
.El
.El
.Ss Typical Program Flow
.Bl -enum
.It
An application would first invoke function
.Fn pmc_init
to allow the library to initialize itself.
.It
Signal handling would then be set up.
.It
Next the application would allocate the PMCs it desires using function
.Fn pmc_allocate .
.It
Initial values for PMCs may be set using function
.Fn pmc_set .
.It
If a log file is necessary for the PMCs to work, it would
be configured using function
.Fn pmc_configure_logfile .
.It
Process scope PMCs would then be attached to their target processes
using function
.Fn pmc_attach .
.It
The PMCs would then be started using function
.Fn pmc_start .
.It
Once started, the values of counting PMCs may be read using function
.Fn pmc_read .
For PMCs that write events to the log file, this logged data would be
read and parsed using the
.Xr pmclog 3
family of functions.
.It
PMCs are stopped using function
.Fn pmc_stop ,
and process scope PMCs are detached from their targets using
function
.Fn pmc_detach .
.It
Before the process exits, its may release its PMCs using function
.Fn pmc_release .
Any configured log file may be closed using function
.Fn pmc_configure_logfile .
.El
.Sh EVENT SPECIFIERS
Event specifiers are strings comprising of an event name, followed by
optional parameters modifying the semantics of the hardware event
being probed.
Event names are PMC architecture dependent, but the PMC library defines
machine independent aliases for commonly used events.
.Pp
Event specifiers spellings are case-insensitive and space characters,
periods, underscores and hyphens are considered equivalent to each other.
Thus the event specifiers
.Qq "Example Event" ,
.Qq "example-event" ,
and
.Qq "EXAMPLE_EVENT"
are equivalent.
.Ss PMC Architecture Dependent Events
PMC architecture dependent event specifiers are described in the
following manual pages:
.Bl -column " PMC_CLASS_TSC " "MANUAL PAGE "
.It Em "PMC Class"      Ta Em "Manual Page"
.It Li PMC_CLASS_IAF    Ta Xr pmc.iaf 3
.It Li PMC_CLASS_IAP    Ta Xr pmc.atom 3 , Xr pmc.core 3 , Xr pmc.core2 3

.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The interface between the
.Nm pmc
library and the
.Xr hwpmc 4
driver is intended to be private to the implementation and may
change.
In order to ease forward compatibility with future versions of the

driver, applications are urged to dynamically link with the
.Nm pmc
library.
