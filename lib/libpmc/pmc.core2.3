.Lb libpmc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pmc.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn Intel
.Tn "Core2"
CPUs contain PMCs conforming to version 2 of the
.Tn Intel
performance measurement architecture.
These CPUs may contain up to two classes of PMCs:
.Bl -tag -width "Li PMC_CLASS_IAP"
.It Li PMC_CLASS_IAF
Fixed-function counters that count only one hardware event per counter.
.It Li PMC_CLASS_IAP
Programmable counters that may be configured to count one of a defined
set of hardware events.
.El
.Pp
The number of PMCs available in each class and their widths need to be
determined at run time by calling
.Xr pmc_cpuinfo 3 .
.Pp
Intel Core2 PMCs are documented in
.Rs
.%B "IA-32 Intel(R) Architecture Software Developer's Manual"
