.Sh NAME

.Nd allocate and free performance monitoring counters
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpmc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pmc.h
.Ft int
.Fo pmc_allocate
.Fa "const char *eventspecifier"
.Fa "enum pmc_mode mode"
.Fa "uint32_t flags"
.Fa "int cpu"
.Fa "pmc_id_t *pmcid"

.Fn pmc_release "pmc_id_t pmc"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn pmc_allocate
allocates a performance monitoring counter that measures the events
named by argument
.Fa eventspecifier ,
and writes the allocated handle to the location pointed to by argument
.Fa pmcid .
.Pp
Argument
.Fa eventspecifier
comprises an PMC event name followed by an optional comma separated
list of keywords and qualifiers.
The allowed syntax for argument
.Fa eventspecifier
is processor specific and is listed in section
.Sx "EVENT SPECIFIERS"
in the
.Xr pmc 3
manual page.
.Pp
The desired PMC mode is specified by argument
.Fa mode .
Legal values for the
.Fa mode
argument are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv PMC_MODE_SS" -compact
.It Dv PMC_MODE_SC
Allocate a system-scope counting PMC.
.It Dv PMC_MODE_SS
Allocate a system-scope sampling PMC.
.It Dv PMC_MODE_TC
Allocate a process-scope counting PMC.
.It Dv PMC_MODE_TS
Allocate a process-scope sampling PMC.
.El
.Pp
Mode specific modifiers may be specified using argument
.Fa flags .
The flags supported at PMC allocation time are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv PMC_F_LOG_PROCEXIT" -compact
.It Dv PMC_F_DESCENDANTS
For process-scope PMCs, automatically track descendants of attached
processes.
.It Dv PMC_F_LOG_PROCCSW
For process-scope counting PMCs, generate a log event at every context
switch containing the incremental number of hardware events seen
by the process during the time it was executing on the CPU.
.It Dv PMC_F_LOG_PROCEXIT
For process-scope counting PMCs, accumulate hardware events seen
when the process was executing on a CPU and generate a log event
when an attached process exits.
.El
PMCs allocated with flags
.Dv PMC_F_LOG_PROCCSW
and
.Dv PMC_F_LOG_PROCEXIT
need a log file to be configured before they are started.
.Pp
For system scope PMCs, the argument
.Fa cpu
is a non-negative value that specifies the CPU number
that the PMC is to be allocated on.
Process scope PMC allocations should specify the constant
.Dv PMC_CPU_ANY
for this argument.
.Pp
Function
.Fn pmc_release
releases the PMC denoted by argument
.Fa pmcid .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, function
.Fn pmc_allocate
sets the location specified by argument
.Fa pmcid
to the handle of the allocated PMC and returns 0.
In case of an error, the function returns -1 and sets the global
variable
.Va errno
to indicate the error.
.Pp
.Rv -std pmc_release
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The argument
.Fa mode
to function
.Fn pmc_allocate
had an invalid value.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Argument
.Fa cpu
to function
.Fn pmc_allocate
had an invalid CPU number.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Argument
.Fa flags
contained flags that were unsupported or otherwise incompatible with
the requested PMC mode.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Argument
.Fa eventspecifier
to function
.Fn pmc_allocate
specified an event not supported by hardware or contained a syntax
error.
.It Bq Er ENXIO
Function
.Fn pmc_allocate
requested the use of a hardware resource that was absent or
administratively disabled.
.It Bq Er EOPNOTSUPP
The underlying hardware does not support the capabilities needed for
a PMC being allocated by a call to
.Fn pmc_allocate .
.It Bq Er EPERM
A system scope PMC allocation was attempted without adequate process
privilege.
.It Bq Er ESRCH
Function
.Fn pmc_release
was called without first having allocated a PMC.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Argument
.Fa pmcid
to function
.Fn pmc_release
did not specify a PMC previously allocated by this process.
