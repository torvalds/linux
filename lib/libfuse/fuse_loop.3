.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fuse_loop ,
.Nm fuse_loop_mt
.Nd wait for and process FUSE messages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libfuse
.In fuse.h
.Ft int
.Fn fuse_loop "struct fuse *fuse"
.Ft int
.Fn fuse_loop_mt "struct fuse *fuse"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn fuse_loop
reads from the FUSE device and blocks, waiting for the
kernel to send it fbuf messages.
Each of these specifies a FUSE file system operation to execute.
The callbacks to invoke are specified by calling
.Xr fuse_new 3
or
.Xr fuse_setup 3
prior to calling
.Fn fuse_loop .
.Pp
.Fn fuse_loop
will return when it reads the FBT_DESTROY message, which indicates that
the file system is being unmounted.
.Pp
If FUSE signaler handlers have been installed and either SIGHUP, SIGINT
or SIGTERM is received then
.Fn fuse_loop
will terminate.
See
.Xr fuse_set_signal_handlers 3 .
.Pp
.Fn fuse_loop_mt
is a multi-threaded variant that allows the file system to process
multiple file system operations in parallel.
This is not implemented on
.Ox .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn fuse_loop
will return 0 on success and -1 on failure.
.Pp
.Fn fuse_loop_mt
always returns -1.
.Sh SEE ALSO

and
.Fn fuse_loop_mt
functions conform to FUSE 2.6.
