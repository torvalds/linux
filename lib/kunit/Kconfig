	  Enables support for kernel unit tests (KUnit), a lightweight unit
	  testing and mocking framework for the Linux kernel. These tests are
	  able to be run locally on a developer's workstation without a VM or
	  special hardware when using UML. Can also be used on most other
	  architectures. For more information, please see
	  Documentation/dev-tools/kunit/.
