.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm libcasper
library allows to manage application capabilities through the casper process.
.Pp
The application capability (represented by the
.Vt cap_channel_t
type) is a communication channel between the caller and the casper process
daemon or an instance of one of its services.
A capability to the casper process obtained with the
.Fn cap_init
function allows to create capabilities to casper's services via the
.Fn cap_service_open
function.
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_init
function opens capability to the casper process.
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_wrap
function creates
.Vt cap_channel_t
based on the given socket.
The function is used when capability is inherited through
.Xr execve 2
or send over
.Xr unix 4
domain socket as a regular file descriptor and has to be represented as
.Vt cap_channel_t
again.
The
.Fa flags
argument defines the channel behavior.
The supported flags are:
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It CASPER_NO_UNIQ
The communication between process and casper uses no unique version of nvlist.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_unwrap
function is the opposite of the
.Fn cap_wrap
function.
It frees the
.Vt cap_channel_t
structure and returns
.Xr unix 4
domain socket associated with it.
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_clone
function clones the given capability.
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_close
function closes the given capability.
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_sock
function returns
.Xr unix 4
domain socket descriptor associated with the given capability for use with
system calls like
.Xr kevent 2 ,
.Xr poll 2
and
.Xr select 2 .
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_limit_get
function stores current limits of the given capability in the
.Fa limitsp
argument.
If the function return
.Va 0
and
.Dv NULL
is stored in
.Fa limitsp
it means there are no limits set.
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_limit_set
function sets limits for the given capability.
The limits are provided as a
.Xr nvlist 9 .
The exact format depends on the service the capability represents.
.Fn cap_limit_set
frees the limits regardless of whether the operation succeeds or fails.
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_send_nvlist
function sends the given
.Xr nvlist 9
over the given capability.
This is low level interface to communicate with casper services.
Most services should provide higher level API.
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_recv_nvlist
function receives the given
.Xr nvlist 9
over the given capability.
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_xfer_nvlist
function sends the given
.Xr nvlist 9 ,
destroys it and receives new
.Xr nvlist 9
in response over the given capability.
It does not matter if the function succeeds or fails, the
.Xr nvlist 9
given for sending will always be destroyed once the function returns.
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_service_open
function opens casper service of the given name through casper capability
obtained via the
.Fn cap_init
function.
The function returns capability that provides access to opened service.
Casper supports the following services in the base system:
.Bl -tag -width "system.random" -compact -offset indent
.Pp
.It system.dns
provides DNS libc compatible API
.It system.grp
provides
.Xr getgrent 3
compatible API
.It system.pwd
provides
.Xr getpwent 3
compatible API
.It system.random
allows to obtain entropy from
.Pa /dev/random
.It system.sysctl
provides
.Xr sysctlbyname 3
compatible API
.It system.syslog
provides
.Xr syslog 3
compatible API
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn cap_clone ,
.Fn cap_init ,
.Fn cap_recv_nvlist ,
.Fn cap_service_open ,
.Fn cap_wrap
and
.Fn cap_xfer_nvlist
functions return
.Dv NULL
and set the
.Va errno
variable on failure.
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_limit_get ,
.Fn cap_limit_set
and
.Fn cap_send_nvlist
functions return
.Dv -1
and set the
.Va errno
variable on failure.
.Pp
The
.Fn cap_close ,
.Fn cap_sock
and
.Fn cap_unwrap
functions always succeed.
