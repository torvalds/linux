.Sh DESCRIPTION
The library is used to simplify Capsicumizing a tools that are using file system.
Idea behind the library is that we are passing a remaining
.Fa argc
and
.Fa argv
which contains a list of files that should be open for this program.
The library will create a service that will serve those files.
.Pp
The function
.Fn fileargs_init
create a service to the
.Nm system.fileargs .
The
.Fa argv
contains a list of files that should be opened.
The argument can be set to
.Dv NULL
which will not create a service and all files will be prohibited to be opened.
The
.Fa argc
argument contains a number of passed files.
The
.Fa flags
argument limits opened files for either execution or reading and/or writing.
The
.Fa mode
argument tells which what mode file should be created if the
.Dv O_CREATE
flag is present .
For more details of the
.Fa flags
and
.Fa mode
arguments see
.Xr open 2 .
The
.Fa rightsp
argument contains a list of the capability rights which file should be limited to.
For more details of the capability rights see
.Xr cap_rights_init 3 .
.Pp
The function
.Fn fileargs_cinit
is equivalent to
.Fn fileargs_init
except that the connection to the Casper needs to be provided.
.Pp
The functions
.Fn fileargs_ininv
and
.Fn fileargs_cininv
are respectively equivalent to
.Fn fileargs_init
and
.Fn fileargs_cinit
expect that all arguments all provided as
.Xr nvlist 9 .
For details see
.Sx LIMITS .
.Pp
The
.Fa fileargs_free
close connection to the
.Nm system.filerags
service and free are structures.
The function handle
.Dv NULL
argument.
.Pp
The functions
.Fn fileargs_open
and
.Fn fileargs_fopen
are respectively equivalent to
.Xr open 2
and
.Xr fopen 3
expect that all arguments are fetched from the
.Va fileargs_t
structure.
.Sh LIMITS
This section describe which values and types should be used to pass arguments to the
.Fa system.filerags
through the
.Fn fileargs_ininv
and
.Fn fileargs_cinit
functions.
The
.Xr nvlist 9
for that functions must contain the following values and types:
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It flags ( NV_TYPE_NUMBER )
The
.Va flags
limits opened files for either execution or reading and/or writing.
.It mode (NV_TYPE_NUMBER)
If in the
.Va flags
argument the
.Dv O_CREATE
flag was defined the
.Xr nvlist 9
must contain the
.Va mode .
The
.Va mode
argument tells which what mode file should be created.
.El
.Pp
The
.Xr nvlist 9
for that functions may contain the following values and types:
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It cap_rights ( NV_TYPE_BINARY )
The
.Va cap_rights
argument contains a list of the capability rights which file should be limited to.
.It ( NV_TYPE_NULL )
Any number of
.Dv NV_TYPE_NULL
where the name of the element is name of the file which can be opened.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example first parse some options and then create the
.Nm system.filerags
service with remaining arguments.
.Bd -literal
int ch, fd, i;
cap_rights_t rights;
fileargs_t *fa;

while ((ch = getopt(argc, argv, "h")) != -1) {
	switch (ch) {
		case 'h':
		default:
			usage();
	}
}

argc -= optind;
argv += optind;

/* Create capability to the system.fileargs service. */
fa = fileargs_init(argc, argv, O_RDONLY, 0,
    cap_rights_init(&rights, CAP_READ));
if (fa == NULL)
	err(1, "unable to open system.fileargs service");

/* Enter capability mode sandbox. */
if (cap_enter() < 0 && errno != ENOSYS)
	err(1, "unable to enter capability mode");

/* Open files. */
for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
	fd = fileargs_open(fa, argv[i]);
	if (fd < 0)
		err(1, "unable to open file %s", argv[i]);
	printf("File %s opened in capability mode\n", argv[i]);
	close(fd);
}

fileargs_free(fa);

.Sh BUGS
The
.Lb cap_fileargs
included in
.Fx
is considered experimental, and should not be deployed in production
environments without careful consideration of the risks associated with
the use of experimental operating system features.
