config UBSAN_TRAP
	bool "On Sanitizer warnings, abort the running kernel code"
	depends on !COMPILE_TEST
	depends on $(cc-option, -fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error)
	help
	  Building kernels with Sanitizer features enabled tends to grow
	  the kernel size by around 5%, due to adding all the debugging
	  text on failure paths. To avoid this, Sanitizer instrumentation
	  can just issue a trap. This reduces the kernel size overhead but
	  turns all warnings (including potentially harmless conditions)
	  into full exceptions that abort the running kernel code
	  (regardless of context, locks held, etc), which may destabilize
	  the system. For some system builders this is an acceptable
	  trade-off.

	  Some versions of clang support either UBSAN or KCOV but not the

	help
	  This option enables detection of directly indexed out of bounds
	  array accesses, where the array size is known at compile time.
	  Note that this does not protect array overflows via bad calls
	  to the {str,mem}*cpy() family of functions (that is addressed
	  by CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE).

config UBSAN_ONLY_BOUNDS
	def_bool CC_HAS_UBSAN_BOUNDS && !CC_HAS_UBSAN_ARRAY_BOUNDS
	depends on UBSAN_BOUNDS
	help
	  This is a weird case: Clang's -fsanitize=bounds includes
	  -fsanitize=local-bounds, but it's trapping-only, so for
	  Clang, we must use -fsanitize=array-bounds when we want
	  traditional array bounds checking enabled. For GCC, we
	  want -fsanitize=bounds.

	help
	  This option enables -fsanitize=local-bounds which traps when an
	  exception/error is detected. Therefore, it may only be enabled
	  with CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP.

	  Enabling this option detects errors due to accesses through a
	  pointer that is derived from an object of a statically-known size,
	  where an added offset (which may not be known statically) is
	  out-of-bounds.

	  This option activates instrumentation for the entire kernel.
	  If you don't enable this option, you have to explicitly specify
	  UBSAN_SANITIZE := y for the files/directories you want to check for UB.
	  Enabling this option will get kernel image size increased
