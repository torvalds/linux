.Ft OM_uint32
.Fo gss_display_status
.Fa "OM_uint32 *minor_status"
.Fa "OM_uint32 status_value"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Allows an application to obtain a textual representation of a GSS-API
status code,
for display to the user or for logging purposes.
Since some status values may indicate multiple conditions,
applications may need to call
.Fn gss_display_status
multiple times,
each call generating a single text string.
The
.Fa message_context
parameter is used by
.Fn gss_display_status
to store state information about which error messages have already
been extracted from a given
.Fa status_value ;
.Fa message_context
must be initialized to zero by the application prior to the first call,
and
.Fn gss_display_status
will return a non-zero value in this parameter if there are further
messages to extract.
.Pp
The
.Fa message_context
parameter contains all state information required by
.Fn gss_display_status
in order to extract further messages from the
.Fa status_value ;
even when a non-zero value is returned in this parameter,
the application is not required to call
.Fn gss_display_status
again unless subsequent messages are desired.
The following code extracts all messages from a given status code and prints them to stderr:
.Bd -literal
OM_uint32 message_context;
OM_uint32 status_code;
OM_uint32 maj_status;
OM_uint32 min_status;
gss_buffer_desc status_string;

       ...

message_context = 0;

do {

  maj_status = gss_display_status (
		  &min_status,
		  status_code,
		  GSS_C_GSS_CODE,
		  GSS_C_NO_OID,
		  &message_context,
		  &status_string)

  fprintf(stderr,
	  "%.*s\\n",
	 (int)status_string.length,
	 (char *)status_string.value);

  gss_release_buffer(&min_status, &status_string);

} while (message_context != 0);
.Ed
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width ".It minor_status"
.It minor_status
Mechanism specific status code.
.It status_value
Status value to be converted
.It status_type
.Bl -tag -width ".It GSS_C_MECH_CODE"
.It GSS_C_GSS_CODE
.Fa status_value
is a GSS status code
.It GSS_C_MECH_CODE
.Fa status_value
is a mechanism status code
.El
.It mech_type
Underlying mechanism (used to interpret a minor status value).
Supply
.Dv GSS_C_NO_OID
to obtain the system default.
.It message_context
Should be initialized to zero by the application prior to the first
call.
On return from
.Fn gss_display_status ,
a non-zero status_value parameter indicates that additional messages
may be extracted from the status code via subsequent calls to
.Fn gss_display_status ,
passing the same
.Fa status_value ,
.Fa status_type ,
.Fa mech_type ,
and
.Fa message_context
parameters.
.It status_string
Textual interpretation of the
.Fa status_value .
Storage associated with this parameter must be freed by the
application after use with a call to
.Fn gss_release_buffer .
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Bl -tag -width ".It GSS_S_BAD_STATUS"
.It GSS_S_COMPLETE
Successful completion
.It GSS_S_BAD_MECH
Indicates that translation in accordance with an unsupported mechanism
type was requested
.It GSS_S_BAD_STATUS
The status value was not recognized, or the status type was neither
.Dv GSS_C_GSS_CODE
nor
.Dv GSS_C_MECH_CODE .
