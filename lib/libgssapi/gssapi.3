.Sh NAME
.Nm gssapi
.Nd "Generic Security Services API"
.Sh LIBRARY
GSS-API Library (libgssapi, -lgssapi)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In gssapi/gssapi.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface
provides security services to its callers,
and is intended for implementation atop a variety of underlying
cryptographic mechanisms.
Typically, GSS-API callers will be application protocols into which
security enhancements are integrated through invocation of services
provided by the GSS-API.
The GSS-API allows a caller application to authenticate a principal
identity associated with a peer application, to delegate rights to a
peer,
and to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity
on a per-message basis.
.Pp
There are four stages to using the GSS-API:
.Bl -tag -width "a)"
.It a)
The application acquires a set of credentials with which it may prove
its identity to other processes.
The application's credentials vouch for its global identity,
which may or may not be related to any local username under which it
may be running.
.It b)
A pair of communicating applications establish a joint security
context using their credentials.
The security context is a pair of GSS-API data structures that contain
shared state information, which is required in order that per-message
security services may be provided.
Examples of state that might be shared between applications as part of
a security context are cryptographic keys,
and message sequence numbers.
As part of the establishment of a security context,
the context initiator is authenticated to the responder,
and may require that the responder is authenticated in turn.
The initiator may optionally give the responder the right to initiate
further security contexts,
acting as an agent or delegate of the initiator.
This transfer of rights is termed delegation,
and is achieved by creating a set of credentials,
similar to those used by the initiating application,
but which may be used by the responder.
.Pp
To establish and maintain the shared information that makes up the
security context,
certain GSS-API calls will return a token data structure,
which is an opaque data type that may contain cryptographically
protected data.
The caller of such a GSS-API routine is responsible for transferring
the token to the peer application,
encapsulated if necessary in an application protocol.
On receipt of such a token, the peer application should pass it to a
corresponding GSS-API routine which will decode the token and extract
the information,
updating the security context state information accordingly.
.It c)
Per-message services are invoked to apply either:
.Pp
integrity and data origin authentication, or confidentiality,
integrity and data origin authentication to application data,
which are treated by GSS-API as arbitrary octet-strings.
An application transmitting a message that it wishes to protect will
call the appropriate GSS-API routine (gss_get_mic or gss_wrap) to
apply protection,
specifying the appropriate security context,
and send the resulting token to the receiving application.
The receiver will pass the received token (and, in the case of data
protected by gss_get_mic, the accompanying message-data) to the
corresponding decoding routine (gss_verify_mic or gss_unwrap) to
remove the protection and validate the data.
.It d)
At the completion of a communications session (which may extend across
several transport connections),
each application calls a GSS-API routine to delete the security
context.
Multiple contexts may also be used (either successively or
simultaneously) within a single communications association, at the
option of the applications.

possible on portability grounds.
