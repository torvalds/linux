.Sh DESCRIPTION
Adds a credential-element to a credential.
The credential-element is identified by the name of the principal to
which it refers.
GSS-API implementations must impose a local access-control policy on
callers of this routine to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring
credential-elements to which they are not entitled.
This routine is not intended to provide a "login to the network"
function,
as such a function would involve the creation of new
mechanism-specific authentication data,
rather than merely acquiring a GSS-API handle to existing data.
Such functions,
if required,
should be defined in implementation-specific extensions to the API.
.Pp
If
.Fa desired_name
is
.Dv GSS_C_NO_NAME ,
the call is interpreted as a request to add a credential element that
will invoke default behavior when passed to
.Fn gss_init_sec_context
(if cred_usage is
.Dv GSS_C_INITIATE
or
.Dv GSS_C_BOTH )
or
.Fn gss_accept_sec_context
(if
.Fa cred_usage
is
.Dv GSS_C_ACCEPT
or
.Dv GSS_C_BOTH ).
.Pp
This routine is expected to be used primarily by context acceptors,
since implementations are likely to provide mechanism-specific ways of
obtaining GSS-API initiator credentials from the system login process.
Some implementations may therefore not support the acquisition of
.Dv GSS_C_INITIATE
or
.Dv GSS_C_BOTH
credentials via
.Fn gss_acquire_cred
for any name other than
.Dv GSS_C_NO_NAME ,
or a name produced by applying either
.Fn gss_inquire_cred
to a valid credential,
or
.Fn gss_inquire_context
to an active context.
.Pp
If credential acquisition is time-consuming for a mechanism,
the mechanism may choose to delay the actual acquisition until the
credential is required (e.g. by
.Fn gss_init_sec_context
or
.Fn gss_accept_sec_context ).
Such mechanism-specific implementation decisions should be invisible
to the calling application;
thus a call of
.Fn gss_inquire_cred
immediately following the call of
.Fn gss_add_cred
must return valid credential data,
and may therefore incur the overhead of a deferred credential acquisition.
.Pp
This routine can be used to either compose a new credential containing
all credential-elements of the original in addition to the
newly-acquire credential-element,
or to add the new credential-element to an existing credential.
If
.Dv NULL
is specified for the
.Fa output_cred_handle
parameter argument,
the new credential-element will be added to the credential identified
by
.Fa input_cred_handle ;
if a valid pointer is specified for the
.Fa output_cred_handle
parameter,
a new credential handle will be created.
.Pp
If
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL
is specified as the
.Fa input_cred_handle ,
.Fn gss_add_cred
will compose a credential (and set the
.Fa output_cred_handle
parameter accordingly) based on default behavior.
That is, the call will have the same effect as if the application had
first made a call to
.Fn gss_acquire_cred ,
specifying the same usage and passing
.Dv GSS_C_NO_NAME
as the
.Fa desired_name
parameter to obtain an explicit credential handle embodying default
behavior,
passed this credential handle to
.Fn gss_add_cred ,
and finally called
.Fn gss_release_cred
on the first credential handle.
.Pp
If
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL
is specified as the
.Fa input_cred_handle
parameter,
a non-
.Dv NULL
.Fa output_cred_handle
must be supplied.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width ".It output_cred_handle"
.It minor_status
Mechanism specific status code.
.It input_cred_handle
The credential to which a credential-element will be added.
If
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL
is specified, the routine will compose the new credential based on
default behavior (see description above).
Note that, while the credential-handle is not modified by
.Fn gss_add_cred ,
the underlying credential will be modified if
.Fa output_credential_handle
is
.Dv NULL .
.It desired_name
Name of principal whose credential should be acquired.
.It desired_mech
Underlying security mechanism with which the credential may be used.
.It cred_usage
.Bl -tag -width "GSS_C_INITIATE"
.It GSS_C_BOTH
Credential may be used either to initiate or accept security
contexts.
.It GSS_C_INITIATE
Credential will only be used to initiate security contexts.
.It GSS_C_ACCEPT
Credential will only be used to accept security contexts.
.El
.It initiator_time_req
Number of seconds that the credential should remain valid for
initiating security contexts.
This argument is ignored if the composed credentials are of type
.Dv GSS_C_ACCEPT .
Specify
.Dv GSS_C_INDEFINITE
to request that the credentials have the maximum permitted initiator lifetime.
.It acceptor_time_req
Number of seconds that the credential should remain valid for
accepting security contexts.
This argument is ignored if the composed credentials are of type
.Dv GSS_C_INITIATE .
Specify
.Dv GSS_C_INDEFINITE
to request that the credentials have the maximum permitted initiator lifetime.
.It output_cred_handle
The returned credential handle,
containing
the new credential-element and all the credential-elements from
.Fa input_cred_handle .
If a valid pointer to a
.Fa gss_cred_id_t
is supplied for this parameter,
.Fn gss_add_cred
creates a new credential handle containing all credential-elements
from the
.Fa input_cred_handle
and the newly acquired credential-element;
if
.Dv NULL
is specified for this parameter,
the newly acquired credential-element will be added to the credential
identified by
.Fa input_cred_handle .
.Pp
The resources associated with any credential handle returned via this
parameter must be released by the application after use with a call to
.Fn gss_release_cred .
.It actual_mechs
The complete set of mechanisms for which the new credential is valid.
Storage for the returned OID-set must be freed by the application
after use with a call to
.Fn gss_release_oid_set .
Specify
.Dv NULL if not required.
.It initiator_time_rec
Actual number of seconds for which the returned credentials will
remain valid for initiating contexts using the specified mechanism.
If the implementation or mechanism does not support expiration of
credentials,
the value
.Dv GSS_C_INDEFINITE
will be returned.
Specify
.Dv NULL
if not required.
.It acceptor_time_rec
Actual number of seconds for which the returned credentials will
remain valid for accepting security contexts using the specified
mechanism.
If the implementation or mechanism does not support expiration of
credentials,
the value
.Dv GSS_C_INDEFINITE
will be returned.
Specify
.Dv NULL
if not required.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Bl -tag -width ".It GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED"
.It GSS_S_COMPLETE
Successful completion.
.It GSS_S_BAD_MECH
Unavailable mechanism requested.
.It GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE
Type contained within desired_name parameter is not supported
.It GSS_S_BAD_NAME
Value supplied for desired_name parameter is ill-formed.
.It GSS_S_DUPLICATE_ELEMENT
The credential already contains an element for the requested mechanism
with overlapping usage and validity period.
.It GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED
The required credentials could not be added because they have expired.
.It GSS_S_NO_CRED
No credentials were found for the specified name.
