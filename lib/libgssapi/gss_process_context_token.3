.Nd Process a token on a security context from a peer application
.\" This next command is for sections 2 and 3 only.
.\" .Sh LIBRARY
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In "gssapi/gssapi.h"
.Ft OM_uint32
.Fo gss_process_context_token
.Fa "OM_uint32 *minor_status"
.Fa "const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle"
.Fa "const gss_buffer_t token_buffer"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Provides a way to pass an asynchronous token to the security service.
Most context-level tokens are emitted and processed synchronously by
.Fn gss_init_sec_context
and
.Fn gss_accept_sec_context ,
and the application is informed as to whether further tokens are
expected by the
.Dv GSS_C_CONTINUE_NEEDED
major status bit.
Occasionally,
a mechanism may need to emit a context-level token at a point when the
peer entity is not expecting a token.
For example,
the initiator's final call to
.Fn gss_init_sec_context
may emit a token and return a status of
.Dv GSS_S_COMPLETE ,
but the acceptor's call to
.Fn gss_accept_sec_context
may fail.
The acceptor's mechanism may wish to send a token containing an error
indication to the initiator,
but the initiator is not expecting a token at this point,
believing that the context is fully established.
.Fn gss_process_context_token
provides a way to pass such a token to the mechanism at any time.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width ".It context_handle"
.It minor_status
Mechanism specific status code.
.It context_handle
Context handle of context on which token is to be processed.
.It token_buffer
Token to process.

.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Bl -tag -width ".It GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN"
.It GSS_S_COMPLETE
Successful completion
.It GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN
Indicates that consistency checks performed on the token failed
.It GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT
The
.Fa context_handle
did not refer to a valid context
