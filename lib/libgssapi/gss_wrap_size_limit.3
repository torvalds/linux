.Sh DESCRIPTION
Allows an application to determine the maximum message size that,
if presented to
.Xr gss_wrap 3
with the same
.Dv conf_req_flag
and
.Dv qop_req
parameters,
will result in an output token containing no more than
.Dv req_output_size
bytes.
.Pp
This call is intended for use by applications that
communicate over protocols that impose a maximum message size.
It enables the application to fragment messages prior to applying protection.
.Pp
GSS-API implementations are recommended but not required to detect
invalid QOP values when
.Fn gss_wrap_size_limit
is called.
This routine guarantees only a maximum message size,
not the availability of specific QOP values for message protection.
.Pp
Successful completion of this call does not guarantee that
.Xr gss_wrap 3
will be able to protect a message of length max_input_size bytes,
since this ability may depend on the availability of system resources
at the time that
.Xr gss_wrap 3
is called.
However, if the implementation itself imposes an upper limit on
the length of messages that may be processed by gss_wrap,
the implementation should not return a value via
.Dv max_input_bytes
that is greater than this length.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width ".It req_output_size"
.It minor_status
Mechanism specific status code.
.It context_handle
A handle that refers to the security over which the messages will be sent.
.It conf_req_flag
Indicates whether
.Xr gss_wrap 3
will be asked to apply confidentiality protection
in addition to integrity protection.
.It qop_req
Indicates the level of protection that
.Xr gss_wrap 3
will be asked to provide.
.It req_output_size
The desired maximum size for tokens emitted by
.Xr gss_wrap 3 .
.It max_input_size
The maximum input message size that may be presented to
.Xr gss_wrap 3
in order to guarantee that the emitted token shall
be no larger than
.Dv req_output_size
bytes.

.It GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT
The referenced context could not be accessed.
.It GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED
The context has expired.
