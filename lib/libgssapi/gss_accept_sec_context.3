.Sh DESCRIPTION
Allows a remotely initiated security context between the application
and a remote peer to be established.  The routine may return a
.Fa output_token
which should be transferred to the peer application,
where the peer application will present it to
.Xr gss_init_sec_context 3 .
If no token need be sent,
.Fn gss_accept_sec_context
will indicate this
by setting the length field of the
.Fa output_token
argument to zero.
To complete the context establishment, one or more reply tokens may be
required from the peer application; if so,
.Fn gss_accept_sec_context
will return a status flag of
.Dv GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED , in which case it
should be called again when the reply token is received from the peer
application, passing the token to
.Fn gss_accept_sec_context
via the
.Fa input_token
parameters.
.Pp
Portable applications should be constructed to use the token length
and return status to determine whether a token needs to be sent or
waited for.  Thus a typical portable caller should always invoke
.Fn gss_accept_sec_context
within a loop:
.Bd -literal
gss_ctx_id_t context_hdl = GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT;

do {
  receive_token_from_peer(input_token);
  maj_stat = gss_accept_sec_context(&min_stat,
				    &context_hdl,
				    cred_hdl,
				    input_token,
				    input_bindings,
				    &client_name,
				    &mech_type,
				    output_token,
				    &ret_flags,
				    &time_rec,
				    &deleg_cred);
  if (GSS_ERROR(maj_stat)) {
    report_error(maj_stat, min_stat);
  };
  if (output_token->length != 0) {
    send_token_to_peer(output_token);

    gss_release_buffer(&min_stat, output_token);
  };
  if (GSS_ERROR(maj_stat)) {
    if (context_hdl != GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT)
      gss_delete_sec_context(&min_stat,
			     &context_hdl,
			     GSS_C_NO_BUFFER);
    break;
  };
} while (maj_stat & GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED);
.Ed
.Pp
Whenever the routine returns a major status that includes the value
.Dv GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED , the context is not fully established and the
following restrictions apply to the output parameters:
.Pp
The value returned via the
.Fa time_rec
parameter is undefined unless the
accompanying
.Fa ret_flags
parameter contains the bit
.Dv GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG , indicating that per-message services may be
applied in advance of a successful completion status, the value
returned via the
.Fa mech_type
parameter may be undefined until the
routine returns a major status value of
.Dv GSS_S_COMPLETE .
.Pp
The values of the
.Dv GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG ,
.Dv GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG ,
.Dv GSS_C_REPLAY_FLAG ,
.Dv GSS_C_SEQUENCE_FLAG ,
.Dv GSS_C_CONF_FLAG ,
.Dv GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG
and
.Dv GSS_C_ANON_FLAG bits returned
via the
.Fa ret_flags
parameter should contain the values that the
implementation expects would be valid if context establishment were
to succeed.
.Pp
The values of the
.Dv GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG
and
.Dv GSS_C_TRANS_FLAG bits
within
.Fa ret_flags
should indicate the actual state at the time
.Fn gss_accept_sec_context
returns, whether or not the context is fully established.
.Pp
Although this requires that GSS-API implementations set the
.Dv GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG
in the final
.Fa ret_flags
returned to a caller
(i.e. when accompanied by a
.Dv GSS_S_COMPLETE
status code), applications
should not rely on this behavior as the flag was not defined in
Version 1 of the GSS-API. Instead, applications should be prepared to
use per-message services after a successful context establishment,
according to the
.Dv GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG
and
.Dv GSS_C_CONF_FLAG values.
.Pp
All other bits within the
.Fa ret_flags
argument should be set to zero.
While the routine returns
.Dv GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED , the values returned
via the
.Fa ret_flags
argument indicate the services that the
implementation expects to be available from the established context.
.Pp
If the initial call of
.Fn gss_accept_sec_context
fails, the
implementation should not create a context object, and should leave
the value of the context_handle parameter set to
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT to
indicate this.  In the event of a failure on a subsequent call, the
implementation is permitted to delete the "half-built" security
context (in which case it should set the
.Fa context_handle
parameter to
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT ), but the preferred behavior is to leave the
security context (and the context_handle parameter) untouched for the
application to delete (using
.Xr gss_delete_sec_context 3 ).
.Pp
During context establishment, the informational status bits
.Dv GSS_S_OLD_TOKEN
and
.Dv GSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN
indicate fatal errors, and
GSS-API mechanisms should always return them in association with a
routine error of
.Dv GSS_S_FAILURE .  This requirement for pairing did not
exist in version 1 of the GSS-API specification, so applications that
wish to run over version 1 implementations must special-case these
codes.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width ".It input_chan_bindings"
.It context_handle
Context handle for new context.
Supply
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT for first
call; use value returned in subsequent calls.
Once
.Fn gss_accept_sec_context
has returned a
value via this parameter, resources have been
assigned to the corresponding context, and must
be freed by the application after use with a
call to
.Xr gss_delete_sec_context 3 .
.It acceptor_cred_handle
Credential handle claimed by context acceptor.
Specify
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL to accept the context as a
default principal.
If
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL is
specified, but no default acceptor principal is
defined,
.Dv GSS_S_NO_CRED will be returned.
.It input_token_buffer
Token obtained from remote application.
.It input_chan_bindings
Application-specified bindings.
Allows application to securely bind channel identification information
to the security context.
If channel bindings are not used, specify
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CHANNEL_BINDINGS .
.It src_name
Authenticated name of context initiator.
After use, this name should be deallocated by passing it to
.Xr gss_release_name 3 .
If not required, specify
.Dv NULL .
.It mech_type
Security mechanism used.
The returned OID value will be a pointer into static storage,
and should be treated as read-only by the caller
(in particular, it does not need to be freed).
If not required, specify
.Dv NULL .
.It output_token
Token to be passed to peer application.
If the length field of the returned token buffer is 0,
then no token need be passed to the peer application.
If a non-zero length field is returned,
the associated storage must be freed after use by the
application with a call to
.Xr gss_release_buffer 3 .
.It ret_flags
Contains various independent flags,
each of which indicates that the context supports a specific service option.
If not needed, specify
.Dv NULL .
Symbolic names are provided for each flag,
and the symbolic names corresponding to the required flags should be
logically-ANDed with the
.Fa ret_flags
value to test whether a given option is supported by the context.
The flags are:
.Bl -tag -width "WW"
.It GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG
.Bl -tag -width "False"
.It True

data-origin authentication and integrity services only.
.El
.It GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG
.Bl -tag -width "False"
.It True
Integrity service may be invoked by calling either
.Xr gss_get_mic 3
or

routines.
.It False
Per-message integrity service unavailable.
.El
.It GSS_C_ANON_FLAG
.Bl -tag -width "False"
.It True
The initiator does not wish to be authenticated; the
.Fa src_name
parameter (if requested) contains an anonymous internal name.
.It False
The initiator has been authenticated normally.
.El
.It GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG
.Bl -tag -width "False"
.It True
Protection services (as specified by the states of the
.Dv GSS_C_CONF_FLAG
and
.Dv GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG )
are available if the accompanying major status return value is either
.Dv GSS_S_COMPLETE
or
.Dv GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED.
.It False
Protection services (as specified by the states of the
.Dv GSS_C_CONF_FLAG
and
.Dv GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG )
are available only if the accompanying major status return value is
.Dv GSS_S_COMPLETE .
.El
.It GSS_C_TRANS_FLAG
.Bl -tag -width "False"
.It True
The resultant security context may be transferred to other processes
via a call to
.Xr gss_export_sec_context 3 .
.It False
The security context is not transferable.
.El
.El
.Pp
All other bits should be set to zero.
.It time_rec
Number of seconds for which the context will remain valid.
Specify
.Dv NULL
if not required.
.It delegated_cred_handle
Credential
handle for credentials received from context initiator.
Only valid if
.Dv GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG
in
.Fa ret_flags
is true,
in which case an explicit credential handle
(i.e. not
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL )
will be returned; if false,
.Fn gss_accept_context
will set this parameter to
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL .
If a credential handle is returned,
the associated resources must be released by the application after use
with a call to
.Xr gss_release_cred 3 .
Specify
.Dv NULL if not required.
