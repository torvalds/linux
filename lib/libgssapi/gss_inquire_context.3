.Sh DESCRIPTION
Obtains information about a security context.
The caller must already have obtained a handle that refers to the
context,
although the context need not be fully established.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width ".It locally_initiated"
.It minor_status
Mechanism specific status code.
.It context_handle
A handle that refers to the security context.
.It src_name
The name of the context initiator.
If the context was established using anonymous authentication,
and if the application invoking
.Fn gss_inquire_context
is the context acceptor,
an anonymous name will be returned.
Storage associated with this name must be freed by the application
after use with a call to
.Fn gss_release_name .
Specify
.Dv NULL
if not required.
.It targ_name
The name of the context acceptor.
Storage associated with this name must be freed by the application
after use with a call to
.Fn gss_release_name .
If the context acceptor did not authenticate itself,
and if the initiator did not specify a target name in its call to
.Fn gss_init_sec_context ,
the value
.Dv GSS_C_NO_NAME
will be returned.
Specify
.Dv NULL
if not required.
.It lifetime_rec
The number of seconds for which the context will remain valid.
If the context has expired,
this parameter will be set to zero.
If the implementation does not support context expiration,
the value
.Dv GSS_C_INDEFINITE
will be returned.
Specify
.Dv NULL
if not required.
.It mech_type
The security mechanism providing the context.
The returned OID will be a pointer to static storage that should be
treated as read-only by the application;
in particular the application should not attempt to free it.
Specify
.Dv NULL
if not required.
.It ctx_flags
Contains various independent flags,
each of which indicates that the context supports
(or is expected to support, if
.Fa open
is false)
a specific service option.
If not needed, specify
.Dv NULL .
Symbolic names are provided for each flag,
and the symbolic names corresponding to the required flags should be
logically-ANDed with the
.Fa ctx_flags
value to test whether a given option is supported by the context.
The flags are:
.Bl -tag -width "WW"
.It GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG
.Bl -tag -width "False"
.It True
Credentials were delegated from the initiator to the acceptor.
.It False
No credentials were delegated.
.El
.It GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG
.Bl -tag -width "False"
.It True
The acceptor was authenticated to the initiator.
.It False
The acceptor did not authenticate itself.
.El
.It GSS_C_REPLAY_FLAG
.Bl -tag -width "False"
.It True
Replay of protected messages will be detected.
.It False
Replayed messages will not be detected.
.El
.It GSS_C_SEQUENCE_FLAG
.Bl -tag -width "False"
.It True
Out-of-sequence protected messages will be detected.
.It False
Out-of-sequence messages will not be detected.
.El
.It GSS_C_CONF_FLAG
.Bl -tag -width "False"
.It True
Confidentiality service may be invoked by calling
.Fn gss_wrap
routine.
.It False
No confidentiality service
(via
.Fn gss_wrap )
available.
.Fn gss_wrap
will provide message encapsulation,
data-origin authentication and integrity services only.
.El
.It GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG
.Bl -tag -width "False"
.It True
Integrity service may be invoked by calling either
.Fn gss_get_mic
or
.Fn gss_wrap
routines.
.It False
Per-message integrity service unavailable.
.El
.It GSS_C_ANON_FLAG
.Bl -tag -width "False"
.It True
The initiator's identity will not be revealed to the acceptor.
The
.Fa src_name
parameter (if requested) contains an anonymous internal name.
.It False
The initiator has been authenticated normally.
.El
.It GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG
.Bl -tag -width "False"
.It True
Protection services
(as specified by the states of the
.Dv GSS_C_CONF_FLAG
and
.Dv GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG )
are available for use.
.It False
Protection services
(as specified by the states of the
.Dv GSS_C_CONF_FLAG
and
.Dv GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG )
are available only if the context is fully established
(i.e. if the
.Fa open
parameter is non-zero).
.El
.It GSS_C_TRANS_FLAG
.Bl -tag -width "False"
.It True
The security context may be transferred to other processes via a call to
.Fn gss_export_sec_context .
.It False
The security context is not transferable.
.El
.El
.It locally_initiated
Non-zero if the invoking application is the context initiator.
Specify
.Dv NULL
if not required.
.It open
Non-zero if the context is fully established;
Zero if a context-establishment token is expected from the peer
application.
Specify
.Dv NULL
if not required.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Bl -tag -width ".It GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT"
.It GSS_S_COMPLETE
Successful completion
.It GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT
The referenced context could not be accessed
