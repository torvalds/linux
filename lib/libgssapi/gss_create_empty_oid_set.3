.Sh DESCRIPTION
Create an object-identifier set containing no object identifiers,
to which members may be subsequently added using the
.Fn gss_add_oid_set_member
routine.
These routines are intended to be used to construct sets of mechanism
object identifiers for input to
.Fn gss_acquire_cred .
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width ".It minor_status"
.It minor_status
Mechanism specific status code.
.It oid_set
The empty object identifier set.
The routine will allocate the gss_OID_set_desc object,
