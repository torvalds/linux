.Sh DESCRIPTION
Initiates the establishment of a security context between the
application and a remote peer.
Initially, the input_token parameter should be specified either as
.Dv GSS_C_NO_BUFFER, or as a pointer to a
gss_buffer_desc object whose length field contains the value zero.
The routine may return a output_token which should be transferred to
the peer application, where the peer application will present it to
.Xr gss_accept_sec_context 3 . If no token need be sent,
.Fn gss_init_sec_context
will indicate this by setting the
.Dv length field
of the output_token argument to zero. To complete the context
establishment, one or more reply tokens may be required from the peer
application; if so,
.Fn gss_init_sec_context
will return a status
containing the supplementary information bit
.Dv GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED.
In this case,
.Fn gss_init_sec_context
should be called again when the reply token is received from the peer
application, passing the reply token to
.Fn gss_init_sec_context
via the input_token parameters.
.Pp
Portable applications should be constructed to use the token length
and return status to determine whether a token needs to be sent or
waited for.  Thus a typical portable caller should always invoke
.Fn gss_init_sec_context
within a loop:
.Bd -literal
int context_established = 0;
gss_ctx_id_t context_hdl = GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT;
       ...
input_token->length = 0;

while (!context_established) {
  maj_stat = gss_init_sec_context(&min_stat,
				  cred_hdl,
				  &context_hdl,
				  target_name,
				  desired_mech,
				  desired_services,
				  desired_time,
				  input_bindings,
				  input_token,
				  &actual_mech,
				  output_token,
				  &actual_services,
				  &actual_time);
  if (GSS_ERROR(maj_stat)) {
    report_error(maj_stat, min_stat);
  };

  if (output_token->length != 0) {
    send_token_to_peer(output_token);
    gss_release_buffer(&min_stat, output_token)
  };
  if (GSS_ERROR(maj_stat)) {

    if (context_hdl != GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT)
      gss_delete_sec_context(&min_stat,
			     &context_hdl,
			     GSS_C_NO_BUFFER);
    break;
  };

  if (maj_stat & GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED) {
    receive_token_from_peer(input_token);
  } else {
    context_established = 1;
  };
};
.Ed
.Pp
Whenever the routine returns a major status that includes the value
.Dv GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED, the context is not fully established and the
following restrictions apply to the output parameters:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The value returned via the
.Fa time_rec
parameter is undefined Unless
the accompanying
.Fa ret_flags
parameter contains the bit
.Dv GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG, indicating that per-message services may be
applied in advance of a successful completion status, the value
returned via the
.Fa actual_mech_type
parameter is undefined until the
routine returns a major status value of
.Dv GSS_S_COMPLETE.
.It
The values of the
.Dv GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG ,
.Dv GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG ,
.Dv GSS_C_REPLAY_FLAG ,
.Dv GSS_C_SEQUENCE_FLAG ,
.Dv GSS_C_CONF_FLAG ,
.Dv GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG and
.Dv GSS_C_ANON_FLAG bits returned via the
.Fa ret_flags
parameter should contain the values that the
implementation expects would be valid if context establishment
were to succeed.  In particular, if the application has requested
a service such as delegation or anonymous authentication via the
.Fa req_flags
argument, and such a service is unavailable from the
underlying mechanism,
.Fn gss_init_sec_context
should generate a token
that will not provide the service, and indicate via the
.Fa ret_flags
argument that the service will not be supported.  The application
may choose to abort the context establishment by calling
.Xr gss_delete_sec_context 3
(if it cannot continue in the absence of
the service), or it may choose to transmit the token and continue
context establishment (if the service was merely desired but not
mandatory).
.It
The values of the
.Dv GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG and
.Dv GSS_C_TRANS_FLAG bits
within
.Fa ret_flags
should indicate the actual state at the time
.Fn gss_init_sec_context
returns, whether or not the context is fully established.
.It
GSS-API implementations that support per-message protection are
encouraged to set the
.Dv GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG in the final
.Fa ret_flags
returned to a caller (i.e. when accompanied by a
.Dv GSS_S_COMPLETE
status code).  However, applications should not rely on this
behavior as the flag was not defined in Version 1 of the GSS-API.
Instead, applications should determine what per-message services
are available after a successful context establishment according
to the
.Dv GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG and
.Dv GSS_C_CONF_FLAG values.
.It
All other bits within the
.Fa ret_flags
argument should be set to
zero.
.El
.Pp
If the initial call of
.Fn gss_init_sec_context
fails, the
implementation should not create a context object, and should leave
the value of the
.Fa context_handle
parameter set to
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT to
indicate this.  In the event of a failure on a subsequent call, the
implementation is permitted to delete the "half-built" security
context (in which case it should set the
.Fa context_handle
parameter to
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT ), but the preferred behavior is to leave the
security context untouched for the application to delete (using
.Xr gss_delete_sec_context 3 ).
.Pp
During context establishment, the informational status bits
.Dv GSS_S_OLD_TOKEN and
.Dv GSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN indicate fatal errors, and
GSS-API mechanisms should always return them in association with a
routine error of
.Dv GSS_S_FAILURE .
This requirement for pairing did not
exist in version 1 of the GSS-API specification, so applications that
wish to run over version 1 implementations must special-case these
codes.
.Sh PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -width ".It initiator_cred_handle"
.It minor_status
Mechanism specific status code.
.It initiator_cred_handle
handle for credentials claimed. Supply
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL to act as a default
initiator principal.  If no default
initiator is defined, the function will
return

.It context_handle
context handle for new context.  Supply
.Dv GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT for first call; use value
returned by first call in continuation calls.
