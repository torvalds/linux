.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cgget ,
.Fn cgread ,
and
.Fn cgread1
functions provide cylinder group reads for
.Xr libufs 3
consumers.
The
.Fn cgput ,
.Fn cgwrite ,
and
.Fn cgwrite1
functions provide cylinder group writes for
.Xr libufs 3
consumers.
.Pp
The
.Fn cgget
function reads the cylinder group specified by
.Fa cg
into the buffer pointed to by
.Fa cgp
from the disk referenced by the user-land UFS-disk structure.
The
.Fn cgget
function is the only cylinder group read function that is safe to use
in threaded applications.
.Pp
The
.Fn cgput
function writes the cylinder group specified by
.Va cgp
to the disk referenced by the user-land UFS-disk structure.
The
.Fn cgput
function is the only cylinder group write function that is safe to use
in threaded applications.
Note that the
.Fn cgput
function needs to be called only if the cylinder group has been
modified and the on-disk copy needs to be updated.
.Pp
The
.Fn cgread1
function reads from the cylinder group specified by
.Fa cg
into the
.Va d_cg
cylinder-group structure in a user-land UFS-disk structure.
It sets the
.Va d_lcg
field to the cylinder group number
.Fa cg .
.Pp
The
.Fn cgread
function operates on sequential cylinder groups.
Calling the
.Fn cgread
function is equivalent to calling
.Fn cgread1
with a cylinder group specifier equivalent to the value of the current
.Va d_ccg
field, and then incrementing the
.Va d_ccg
field.
.Pp
The
.Fn cgwrite
function stores on disk the cylinder group held in the
.Va d_cg
cylinder-group structure in a user-land UFS-disk structure.
.Pp
The
.Fn cgwrite1
function provides no additional functionality over the
.Fn cgwrite
function as there is only one place that a given cylinder group
can correctly be written.
If the caller gets the
.Fa cg
parameter wrong, the function fails with the error
.Er EDOOFUS .
This function remains only to provide backward compatibility.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn cgread
function returns 0 if there are no more cylinder groups to read,
1 if there are more cylinder groups, and \-1 on error.
The
.Fn cgread1
function returns 1 on success and \-1 on error.
The other functions return 0 on success and \-1 on error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn cgget ,
.Fn cgread ,
and
.Fn cgread1
functions may fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library function
.Xr bread 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn cgput ,
.Fn cgwrite ,
and
.Fn cgwrite1
functions may fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library function
.Xr bwrite 3 .
Additionally the
.Fn cgwrite1
will return the
.Er EDOOFUS
error if the cylinder group specified does not match the
cylinder group that it is requesting to write.

These functions first appeared as part of
