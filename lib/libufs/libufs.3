.Sh NAME
.Nm libufs
.Nd operate on UFS file systems from userland
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libufs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/mount.h
.In ufs/ufs/ufsmount.h
.In ufs/ufs/dinode.h
.In ufs/ffs/fs.h
.In libufs.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library and the functions it provides are used for implementing
utilities which need to access a UFS file system at a low level from
userland.
Facilities provided are used to implement utilities such as
.Xr newfs 8
and
.Xr dumpfs 8 .
The
.Nm
library is designed to be simple, and to provide functions that are
traditionally useful to have.
.Pp
A disk is represented as the type
.Vt "struct uufsd"
as defined in
.In libufs.h .
The structure is filled out, operations are performed, and the disk
is closed.
.Sh ERRORS
Functions provided by
.Nm
return \-1 in every functional error situation.
They also set the
.Va d_error
field of
.Vt "struct uufsd"
to a string describing the error.
