.Sh NAME
.Nm kvm_getloadavg
.Nd get load average of the system
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libkvm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In kvm.h
.Ft int
.Fn kvm_getloadavg "kvm_t *kd" "double loadavg[]" "int nelem"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn kvm_getloadavg
function returns the number of processes in the system run queue
of the kernel indicated by
.Fa kd ,
averaged over various periods of time.
Up to
.Fa nelem
samples are retrieved and assigned to successive elements of
.Fa loadavg Ns Bq .
The system imposes a maximum of 3 samples, representing averages
over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes, respectively.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If the load average was unobtainable, \-1 is returned; otherwise,
the number of samples actually retrieved is returned.
