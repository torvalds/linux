.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kvm_nlist
.Nd retrieve symbol table names from a kernel image
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libkvm
.In kvm.h
.In nlist.h
.Ft int
.Fn kvm_nlist "kvm_t *kd" "struct nlist *nl"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn kvm_nlist
retrieves the symbol table entries indicated by the name list argument
.Fa \&nl .
This argument points to an array of nlist structures, terminated by
an entry whose
.Fa n_name
field is
.Dv NULL
(see
.Xr nlist 3 ) .
Each symbol is looked up using the
.Fa n_name
field, and if found, the
corresponding
.Fa n_type
and
.Fa n_value
fields are filled in.
These fields are set
to 0 if the symbol is not found.
.Pp
The program
.Xr kvm_mkdb 8
builds a database from the running kernel's namelist.
If the database matches the opened kernel,
.Fn kvm_nlist
uses it to speed lookups.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn kvm_nlist
function returns the number of invalid entries found.
If the kernel symbol table was unreadable, \-1 is returned.
