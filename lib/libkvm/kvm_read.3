.Sh NAME
.Nm kvm_read ,
.Nm kvm_read2 ,
.Nm kvm_write
.Nd read or write kernel virtual memory
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libkvm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In kvm.h
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn kvm_read "kvm_t *kd" "unsigned long addr" "void *buf" "size_t nbytes"
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn kvm_read2 "kvm_t *kd" "kvaddr_t addr" "void *buf" "size_t nbytes"
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn kvm_write "kvm_t *kd" "unsigned long addr" "const void *buf" "size_t nbytes"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn kvm_read ,
.Fn kvm_read2 ,
and
.Fn kvm_write
functions are used to read and write kernel virtual memory (or a crash
dump file).
See
.Fn kvm_open 3
for information regarding opening kernel virtual memory and crash dumps.
.Pp
The
.Fn kvm_read
and
.Fn kvm_read2
functions transfer
.Fa nbytes
bytes of data from
the kernel space address
.Fa addr
to
.Fa buf .
Conversely,
.Fn kvm_write
transfers data from
.Fa buf
to
.Fa addr .
Unlike their SunOS counterparts, these functions cannot be used to
read or write process address spaces.
.Pp
The
.Fn kvm_read2
function uses a different type
.Pq Vt kvaddr_t
for the
.Fa addr
argument to allow use of addresses larger than
.Dv ULONG_MAX
when examining non-native kernel images.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon success, the number of bytes actually transferred is returned.
Otherwise, -1 is returned.
