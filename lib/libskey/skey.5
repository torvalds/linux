.Sh NAME
.Nm skey
.Nd one-time password user database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Pa /etc/skey
directory contains user records for the S/Key one-time password authentication
system.
.Pp
Records take the form of files within
.Pa /etc/skey ,
where each file is named for the user whose record it contains.
For example,
.Pa /etc/skey/root
would hold root's S/Key record.
.Pp
The mode for
.Pa /etc/skey
should be 01730 and it should be owned by root and group auth.
Individual records within
.Pa /etc/skey
should be owned by the user they describe and be mode 0600.
To access S/Key records, a process must run as group auth.
.Pp
Each record consists of five lines:
.Bl -enum
.It
The name of the user the record describes.
This should be the same as the name of the file.
.It
The hash type used for this entry:
one of md5, sha1, or rmd160.
The default is md5.
.It
The sequence number.
This is a decimal number between one and one thousand.
Each time the user authenticates via S/Key this number is decremented by one.
.It
A seed used along with the sequence number and the six S/Key words to
compute the value.
.It
The value expected from the crunching of the user's seed, sequence number,
and the six S/Key words.
When the result matches this value, authentication is considered to have
been successful.
