.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_opieaccess
.Nd OPIEAccess PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_opieaccess
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module is used in conjunction with the
.Xr pam_opie 8
PAM module to ascertain that authentication can proceed by other means
(such as the
.Xr pam_unix 8
module) even if OPIE authentication failed.
To properly use this module,
.Xr pam_opie 8
should be marked
.Dq Li sufficient ,
and
.Nm
should be listed right below it and marked
.Dq Li requisite .
.Pp
The
.Nm
module provides functionality for only one PAM category:
authentication.
In terms of the
.Ar module-type
parameter, this is the
.Dq Li auth
feature.
It also provides null functions for the remaining module types.
.Ss OPIEAccess Authentication Module
The authentication component
.Pq Fn pam_sm_authenticate ,
returns
.Dv PAM_SUCCESS
in two cases:
.Bl -enum
.It
The user does not have OPIE enabled.
.It
The user has OPIE enabled, and the remote host is listed as a trusted
host in
.Pa /etc/opieaccess ,
and the user does not have a file named
.Pa \&.opiealways
in his home directory.
.El
.Pp
Otherwise, it returns
.Dv PAM_AUTH_ERR .
.Pp
The following options may be passed to the authentication module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm allow_local"
.It Cm allow_local
Normally, local logins are subjected to the same restrictions as
remote logins from
.Dq localhost .
This option causes
.Nm
to always allow local logins.
.It Cm debug
.Xr syslog 3
debugging information at
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
level.
.It Cm no_warn
suppress warning messages to the user.
These messages include reasons why the user's authentication attempt
was declined.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa $HOME/.opiealways"
.It Pa /etc/opieaccess
List of trusted hosts or networks.
See
.Xr opieaccess 5
for a description of its syntax.
.It Pa $HOME/.opiealways
The presence of this file makes OPIE mandatory for the user.
