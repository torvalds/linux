.Dt PAM_OPIE 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_opie
.Nd OPIE PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_opie
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The OPIE authentication service module for PAM,
.Nm
provides functionality for only one PAM category:
that of authentication.
In terms of the
.Ar module-type
parameter, this is the
.Dq Li auth
feature.
It also provides a null function for session management.
.Pp
Note that this module does not enforce
.Xr opieaccess 5
checks.
There is a separate module,
.Xr pam_opieaccess 8 ,
for this purpose.
.Ss OPIE Authentication Module
The OPIE authentication component
provides functions to verify the identity of a user
.Pq Fn pam_sm_authenticate ,
which obtains the relevant
.Xr opie 4
credentials.
It provides the user with an OPIE challenge,
and verifies that this is correct with
.Xr opiechallenge 3 .
.Pp
The following options may be passed to the authentication module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm auth_as_self"
.It Cm debug
.Xr syslog 3
debugging information at
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
level.
.It Cm auth_as_self
This option will require the user
to authenticate himself as the user
given by
.Xr getlogin 2 ,
not as the account they are attempting to access.
This is primarily for services like
.Xr su 1 ,
where the user's ability to retype
their own password
might be deemed sufficient.
.It Cm no_fake_prompts
Do not generate fake challenges for users who do not have an OPIE key.
Note that this can leak information to a hypothetical attacker about
who uses OPIE and who does not, but it can be useful on systems where
some users want to use OPIE but most do not.
.El
.Pp
Note that
.Nm
ignores the standard options
.Cm try_first_pass
and
.Cm use_first_pass ,
since a challenge must be generated before the user can submit a valid
response.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/opiekeys" -compact
.It Pa /etc/opiekeys
default OPIE password database.
.El
