The NoLogin service module for PAM,
.Nm
provides functionality for only one PAM category:
account management.
In terms of the
.Ar module-type
parameter, this is the
.Dq Li account
feature.
.Ss NoLogin Account Management Module
The NoLogin account management component,
.Fn pam_sm_acct_mgmt ,
verifies whether logins are administratively disabled via
.Xr nologin 5 .
It returns success if the user's login class has an "ignorenologin"
capability specified in
.Xr login.conf 5
or the
.Xr nologin 5
file does not exist.
If neither condition is met,
then the contents of
.Xr nologin 5
are echoed
before failure is returned.
The location of
.Xr nologin 5
is specified by a "nologin" capability in
.Xr login.conf 5 ,
which defaults to
.Pa /var/run/nologin .
.Pp
The following options may be passed to the module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm no_warn"
.It Cm debug
.Xr syslog 3
debugging information at
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
level.
.It Cm no_warn

reasons why the user's
