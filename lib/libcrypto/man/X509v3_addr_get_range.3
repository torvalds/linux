.Sh NAME
.Nm X509v3_addr_get_afi ,
.Nm X509v3_addr_get_range
.Nd parse helpers for the IP address delegation extension
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libcrypto
.In openssl/x509v3.h
.Ft unsigned
.Fn X509v3_addr_get_afi "const IPAddressFamily *af"
.Ft int
.Fo X509v3_addr_get_range

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509v3_addr_get_afi
returns the address family identifier (AFI) of
.Fa af .
.Pp
.Fn X509v3_addr_get_range
converts the minimum and maximum addresses in
the address prefix or range
.Fa aor
from internal encoding to IP addresses in network byte order
and places copies in the arrays
.Fa min
and
.Fa max ,
of size
.Fa length .
The
.Fa length
must be large enough to accommodate an address for
.Fa afi ,
which is at least 4 for
.Dv IANA_AFI_IPV4
and at least 16 for
.Dv IANA_AFI_IPV6 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509v3_addr_get_afi
returns the AFI encoded in
.Fa af
or 0 if
.Fa af
does not contain a valid AFI, or if the AFI is not IPv4 or IPv6.
.Pp
.Fn X509v3_addr_get_range
returns the number of bytes copied into
.Fa min
and
.Fa max
or 0 on error.
An error occurs if
.Fa aor
is malformed, if
.Fa afi
is not
.Dv IANA_AFI_IPV4
or
.Dv IANA_AFI_IPV6 ,
if either
.Fa min
or
.Fa max
is
.Dv NULL ,
or if
.Fa length
is smaller than 4 or 16, respectively.

.Sh HISTORY
These functions first appeared in OpenSSL 0.9.8e
and have been available since
.Ox 7.1 .
.Sh BUGS
There is no accessor for the SAFI of
.Fa af .
.Pp
An error from
.Fn X509v3_addr_get_afi
is indistinguishable from the reserved AFI 0 being set on
.Fa af .
.Pp
It is not entirely clear how a caller is supposed to obtain an
.Vt IPAddressFamily
object or an
.Vt IPAddressOrRange
object without reaching into various structs documented in
.Xr IPAddressRange_new 3 .
