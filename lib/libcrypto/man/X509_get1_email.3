objects having an
.Fa accessMethod
of OCSP which are contained in the Authority Information Access extension
of the
.Fa certificate .
.Pp
.Fn X509_email_free

.Sh HISTORY
.Fn X509_get1_email
and
.Fn X509_email_free
first appeared in OpenSSL 0.9.6 and have been available since
.Ox 2.9 .

.Fn X509_get1_ocsp
first appeared in OpenSSL 0.9.8h and has been available since
.Ox 4.5 .
.Sh BUGS
.Fn X509_email_free
is utterly misnamed.
It does not operate on any
.Vt X509
object, nor is it in any way restricted to email addresses;
instead, it simply frees a stack of strings.
