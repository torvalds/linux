.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions decode and encode X.509 certificates
and some of their substructures.
For details about the semantics, examples, caveats, and bugs, see
.Xr ASN1_item_d2i 3 .
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509
and
.Fn i2d_X509
decode and encode an ASN.1
.Vt Certificate
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.1.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_bio ,
.Fn d2i_X509_fp ,
.Fn i2d_X509_bio ,
and
.Fn i2d_X509_fp
are similar except that they decode or encode using a
.Vt BIO
or
.Vt FILE
pointer.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_AUX
is similar to
.Fn d2i_X509 ,
but the input is expected to consist of an X.509 certificate followed
by auxiliary trust information.
This is used by the PEM routines to read TRUSTED CERTIFICATE objects.
This function should not be called on untrusted input.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_X509_AUX
is similar to
.Fn i2d_X509 ,
but the encoded output contains both the certificate and any auxiliary
trust information.
This is used by the PEM routines to write TRUSTED CERTIFICATE objects.
Note that this is a non-standard OpenSSL-specific data format.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_CERT_AUX
and
.Fn i2d_X509_CERT_AUX
decode and encode optional non-standard auxiliary data appended to
a certificate, for example friendly alias names and trust data.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_CINF
and
.Fn i2d_X509_CINF
decode and encode an ASN.1
.Vt TBSCertificate
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.1.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_VAL
and
.Fn i2d_X509_VAL
decode and encode an ASN.1
.Vt Validity
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.1.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_re_X509_tbs
is similar to
.Fn i2d_X509 ,
except it encodes only the TBSCertificate portion of the certificate.
.Fn i2d_re_X509_CRL_tbs
and
.Fn i2d_re_X509_REQ_tbs
are analogous for CRL and certificate request, respectively.
The "re" in
.Fn i2d_re_X509_tbs
stands for "re-encode", and ensures that a fresh encoding is generated
in case the object has been modified after creation.
.Pp
The encoding of the TBSCertificate portion of a certificate is cached in
the
.Vt X509
structure internally to improve encoding performance and to ensure
certificate signatures are verified correctly in some certificates with
broken (non-DER) encodings.
.Pp
If, after modification, the
.Vt X509
object is re-signed with
.Xr X509_sign 3 ,
the encoding is automatically renewed.
Otherwise, the encoding of the TBSCertificate portion of the
.Vt X509
can be manually renewed by calling
.Fn i2d_re_X509_tbs .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn d2i_X509 ,
.Fn d2i_X509_bio ,
.Fn d2i_X509_fp ,
and
.Fn d2i_X509_AUX
return a valid
.Vt X509
structure or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_CERT_AUX ,
.Fn d2i_X509_CINF ,
and
.Fn d2i_X509_VAL
return an
.Vt X509_CERT_AUX ,
.Vt X509_CINF ,
or
.Vt X509_VAL
object, respectively, or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_X509 ,
.Fn i2d_X509_AUX ,
.Fn i2d_X509_CERT_AUX ,
.Fn i2d_X509_CINF ,
and
.Fn i2d_X509_VAL
return the number of bytes successfully encoded or a negative value
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_X509_bio
and
.Fn i2d_X509_fp
return 1 for success or 0 if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_re_X509_tbs ,
.Fn i2d_re_X509_CRL_tbs ,
and
.Fn i2d_re_X509_REQ_tbs
return the number of bytes successfully encoded or 0 if an error occurs.
.Pp
For all functions, the error code can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
