.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide the SM4 blockcipher in the
.Xr evp 3
framework.
.Pp
All modes use a key length of 128 bits and act on blocks of 128
bits.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_sm4_cfb
is an alias for
.Fn EVP_sm4_cfb128 ,
implemented as a macro.
.Pp
With an argument of
.Qq sm4
or
.Qq SM4 ,
.Xr EVP_get_cipherbyname 3
returns
.Fn EVP_sm4_cbc .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return an
.Vt EVP_CIPHER
structure that provides the implementation of the symmetric cipher.
