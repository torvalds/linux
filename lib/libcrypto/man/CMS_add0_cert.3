.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn CMS_add0_cert
adds the
.Fa certificate
to the
.Fa certificates
field of
.Fa cms
if it is of the type
.Vt SignedData
or to the
.Fa originatorInfo.certs
field if it is of the type
.Vt EnvelopedData .
.Fn CMS_add1_cert
does the same and also increments the reference count of the
.Fa certificate
with
.Xr X509_up_ref 3
in case of success.
.Pp
.Fn CMS_get1_certs
returns all certificates in
.Fa cms .
.Pp
.Fn CMS_add0_crl
adds the
.Fa crl
to the
.Fa crls
field of
.Fa cms
if it is of the type
.Vt SignedData
or to the
.Fa originatorInfo.crls
field if it is of the type
.Vt EnvelopedData .
.Fn CMS_add1_crl
does the same and also increments the reference count of the
.Fa crl
with
.Xr X509_CRL_up_ref 3
in case of success.
.Pp
.Fn CMS_get1_crls
returns any CRLs in
.Fa cms .
.Pp
An error occurs if
.Fa cms
is of any type other than
.Vt SignedData
or
.Vt EnvelopedData .
.Pp
The same
.Fa certificate
or
.Fa crl
must not be added to the same
.Fa cms
structure more than once.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn CMS_add0_cert ,
.Fn CMS_add1_cert ,
.Fn CMS_add0_crl ,
and
.Fn CMS_add1_crl
return 1 for success or 0 for failure.
.Pp
.Fn CMS_get1_certs
and
.Fn CMS_get1_crls
return the STACK of certificates or CRLs or
.Dv NULL
if there are none or an error occurs.
Possible errors are that the
.Fa cms
type is invalid or memory allocation failure.
Not all errors result in an error on the error stack.
The returned stack must be freed using the appropriate
macro wrapper of
.Xr sk_pop_free 3 ,
namely
.Dv sk_X509_pop_free()
or
.Dv sk_X509_CRL_pop_free() .
