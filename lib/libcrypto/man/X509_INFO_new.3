.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Vt X509_INFO
is a reference-counted wrapper object storing a pointer to an X.509
certificate together with pointers to the associated private key
and to an associated certificate revocation list.
It is for example used internally by
.Xr X509_load_cert_crl_file 3 .

.Fn X509_INFO_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt X509_INFO
object and sets its reference count to 1.
.Pp
.Fn X509_INFO_free
decrements the reference count of
.Fa info
by 1.
If the reference count reaches 0, it frees all referenced objects
as well as the storage needed for
.Fa info
itself.
If
.Fa info
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.

.Vt X509_INFO
object or
