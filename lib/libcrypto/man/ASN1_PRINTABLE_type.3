.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ASN1_PRINTABLE_type
.Nd classify a single-byte character string
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libcrypto
.In openssl/asn1.h
.Ft int
.Fo ASN1_PRINTABLE_type
.Fa "const unsigned char *string"
.Fa "int len"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn ASN1_PRINTABLE_type
assumes that the given
.Fa string
consists of single-byte characters and classifies it
according to which kinds characters occur.
If
.Fa len
is greater than 0, at most
.Fa len
characters are inspected.
Otherwise, the
.Fa string
needs to be NUL-terminated.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the given
.Fa string
contains a character outside the
.Xr ascii 7
range,
.Fn ASN1_PRINTABLE_type
returns
.Dv V_ASN1_T61STRING .
.Pp
Otherwise, if it contains a character that is neither a letter
nor a digit nor the space character
.Po
.Ql "\ " ,
ASCII 0x20
.Pc
nor the apostrophe quote
.Po
.Ql \(aq ,
ASCII 0x27
.Pc
nor contained in the set
.Qq ()+,\-./:=?\& ,
it returns
.Dv V_ASN1_IA5STRING .
.Pp
Otherwise, including if
.Fa string
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer or points to an empty string, it returns
.Dv V_ASN1_PRINTABLESTRING .

.Sh HISTORY
.Fn ASN1_PRINTABLE_type
first appeared in SSLeay 0.4.5d, has been part of the public API
since SSLeay 0.5.1, and has been available since
.Ox 2.4 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The ASN.1 notion of what constitutes a
.Vt PrintableString
is more restrictive than what the C library function
.Xr isprint 3
considers printable.
