.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn BN_rand
generates a cryptographically strong pseudo-random number of
.Fa bits
in length and stores it in
.Fa rnd .
If
.Fa top
is
.Dv BN_RAND_TOP_ANY ,
the most significant bit of the random number can be zero.
If
.Fa top
is
.Dv BN_RAND_TOP_ONE ,
the most significant bit is set to 1, and if
.Fa top
is
.Dv BN_RAND_TOP_TWO ,
the two most significant bits of the number will be set to 1, so
that the product of two such random numbers will always have
.Pf 2* Fa bits
length.
If
.Fa bottom
is
.Dv BN_RAND_BOTTOM_ODD ,
the number will be odd;
if it is
.Dv BN_RAND_BOTTOM_ANY ,
it can be odd or even.
The value of
.Fa bits
must be zero or greater.
If
.Fa bits
is +1 then
.Fa top
cannot be
.Dv BN_RAND_TOP_TWO .
.Pp
.Fn BN_rand_range
generates a cryptographically strong pseudo-random number
.Fa rnd
in the range 0 <=
.Fa rnd No < Fa range .
.Pp
.Fn BN_pseudo_rand
is a deprecated alias for
.Fn BN_rand ,
and
.Fn BN_pseudo_rand_range
for
.Fn BN_rand_range .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The functions return 1 on success, 0 on error.
The error codes can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr BN_new 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn BN_rand
first appeared in SSLeay 0.5.1 and has been available since
.Ox 2.4 .
.Pp
The
.Fa top
== -1 case and the function
.Fn BN_rand_range
first appeared in OpenSSL 0.9.6a and have been available since
.Ox 3.0 .
