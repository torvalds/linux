.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_CRL_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt X509_CRL
object, representing an ASN.1
.Vt CertificateList
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 5.1.
It can hold a pointer to an
.Vt X509_CRL_INFO
object discussed below together with a cryptographic signature
and information about the signature algorithm used.
The reference count is set to 1.
.Pp
.Fn X509_CRL_dup
creates a deep copy of
.Fa crl .
.Pp
.Fn X509_CRL_up_ref
increments the reference count of
.Fa crl
by 1.
.Pp
.Fn X509_CRL_free
decrements the reference count of
.Fa crl
by 1.
If the reference count reaches 0, it frees
.Fa crl .
.Pp
.Fn X509_CRL_INFO_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt X509_CRL_INFO
object, representing an ASN.1
.Vt TBSCertList
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 5.1.
It is used inside the
.Vt X509_CRL
object and can hold a list of revoked certificates, an issuer name,
the time the list was issued, the time when the next update of the
list is due, and optional extensions.
.Fn X509_CRL_INFO_free
frees
.Fa crl_info .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_CRL_new ,
.Fn X509_CRL_dup ,
and
.Fn X509_CRL_INFO_new
return the new
.Vt X509_CRL
or
.Vt X509_CRL_INFO
object, respectively, or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn X509_CRL_up_ref
returns 1 on success or 0 on error.
