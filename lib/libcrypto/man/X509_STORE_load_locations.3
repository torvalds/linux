.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_STORE_load_locations
instructs the
.Fa store
to use the PEM
.Fa file
and all the PEM files in the directories
contained in the colon-separated list
.Fa dirs
for looking up certificates, in addition to files and directories
that are already configured.
The certificates in the directories must be in hashed form, as documented in
.Xr X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir 3 .
Directories already in use are not added again.
If
.Dv NULL
is passed for
.Fa file
or
.Fa dirs ,
no new file or no new directories are added, respectively.
.Pp
.Fn X509_STORE_load_locations
is identical to
.Xr SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations 3
except that it operates directly on an
.Vt X509_STORE
object, rather than on the store used by an SSL context.
See that manual page for more information.
.Pp
.Fn X509_STORE_set_default_paths
is similar except that it instructs the
.Fa store
to use the default PEM file and directory
(as documented in
.Sx FILES )
in addition to what is already configured.
It ignores errors that occur while trying to load the file or to
add the directory, but it may still fail for other reasons, for
example when out of memory while trying to allocate the required
.Vt X509_LOOKUP
objects.
.Pp
.Fn X509_STORE_set_default_paths
is identical to
.Xr SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths 3
except that it operates directly on an
.Vt X509_STORE
object, rather than on the store used by an SSL context.
See that manual page for more information.
.Pp
The above functions are wrappers around
.Xr X509_LOOKUP_load_file 3
and
.Xr X509_LOOKUP_add_dir 3 .
.Pp
.Fn X509_STORE_load_mem
instructs the
.Fa store
to use the certificates contained in the memory
.Fa buffer
of the given
.Fa length
for certificate lookup.
It is a wrapper around
.Xr X509_LOOKUP_add_mem 3 .
.Pp
.Fn X509_STORE_add_lookup
checks whether the
.Fa store
already contains an
.Vt X509_LOOKUP
object using the given
.Fa method ;
if it does, the existing object is returned and no other action occurs.
Otherwise, a new
.Vt X509_LOOKUP
object is allocated, added, and returned.
This function is used internally by all the functions listed above.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_STORE_load_locations
returns 1 if all files and directories specified were successfully
added.
It returns 0 for failure.
That can happen if adding the file failed, if adding any of the
directories failed, or if both arguments were
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
.Fn X509_STORE_set_default_paths
returns 0 for some error conditions and 1 otherwise, not just for
success, but also for various cases of failure.
.Pp
.Fn X509_STORE_load_mem
returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.
In particular, parse errors or lack of memory can cause failure.
.Pp
.Fn X509_STORE_add_lookup
returns the existing or new lookup object or
.Dv NULL
on failure.
This is an internal pointer that must not be freed.
With LibreSSL, the only reason for failure is lack of memory.

.Sh HISTORY
.Fn X509_STORE_load_locations ,
.Fn X509_STORE_set_default_paths ,
and
.Fn X509_STORE_add_lookup
first appeared in SSLeay 0.8.0 and have been available since
.Ox 2.4 .
.Pp
.Fn X509_STORE_load_mem
first appeared in
.Ox 5.7 .
.Sh BUGS
By the time that adding a directory is found to have failed,
the file and some other directories may already have been successfully loaded,
so these functions may change the state of the store even when they fail.
.Pp
.Fn X509_STORE_set_default_paths
clears the error queue, deleting even error information that was
already present when it was called.
