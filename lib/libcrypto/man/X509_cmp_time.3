.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_cmp_time
parses
.Fa asn1_time
and compares it to
.Fa cmp_time ,
or to the current time if
.Fa cmp_time
is
.Dv NULL .
.Fn X509_cmp_current_time
compares it to the current time.
.Pp
.Fn X509_time_adj_ex
sets
.Fa out_time
to a time
.Fa offset_day
and
.Fa offset_sec
later than
.Fa in_time .
The values of
.Fa offset_day
and
.Fa offset_sec
can be negative to set a time before
.Fa in_time .
The
.Fa offset_sec
value can also exceed the number of seconds in a day.
If
.Fa in_time
is
.Dv NULL ,
the current time is used instead.
If
.Fa out_time
is
.Dv NULL ,
a new
.Vt ASN1_TIME
structure is allocated and returned.
.Pp
.Fn X509_time_adj
does the same with a 0 day offset.
.Pp
.Fn X509_gmtime_adj
does the same using the current time instead of
.Fa in_time ,
that is, it sets
.Fa out_time
to a time
.Fa offset_sec
seconds later than the current time.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_cmp_time
and
.Fn X509_cmp_current_time
return -1 if
.Fa asn1_time
is earlier than or equal to
.Fa cmp_time ,
1 if it is later, or 0 on error.
.Pp
.Fn X509_time_adj_ex ,
.Fn X509_time_adj ,
and
.Fn X509_gmtime_adj
return a pointer to the updated or newly allocated
.Vt ASN1_TIME
structure or
.Dv NULL
on error.
