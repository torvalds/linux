.Sh DESCRIPTION
The signing certificate may be included in the signedAttributes
field of a
.Vt SignerInfo
structure to mitigate simple substitution and re-issue attacks.
.Pp
.Fn ESS_SIGNING_CERT_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt ESS_SIGNING_CERT
object, representing an ASN.1
.Vt SigningCertificate
structure defined in RFC 2634 section 5.4.
It can hold the certificate used for signing the data,
additional authorization certificates that can be used during
validation, and policies applying to the certificate.
.Fn ESS_SIGNING_CERT_free
frees
.Fa signing_cert .
.Pp
.Fn ESS_CERT_ID_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt ESS_CERT_ID
object, representing an ASN.1
.Vt ESSCertID
structure defined in RFC 2634 section 5.4.1.
Such objects can be used inside
.Vt ESS_SIGNING_CERT
objects, and each one can hold a SHA1 hash of one certificate.
.Fn ESS_CERT_ID_free
frees
.Fa cert_id .
.Pp
.Fn ESS_ISSUER_SERIAL_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt ESS_ISSUER_SERIAL
object, representing an ASN.1
.Vt IssuerSerial
structure defined in RFC 2634 section 5.4.1.
It can hold an issuer name and a serial number and can be included in an
.Vt ESS_CERT_ID
object, which is useful for additional authorization certificates,
but redundant for the signing certificate itself.
.Fn ESS_ISSUER_SERIAL_free
frees
.Fa issuer_serial .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn ESS_SIGNING_CERT_new ,
.Fn ESS_CERT_ID_new ,
and
.Fn ESS_ISSUER_SERIAL_new
return the new
.Vt ESS_SIGNING_CERT ,
.Vt ESS_CERT_ID ,
or
.Vt ESS_ISSUER_SERIAL
object, respectively, or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurred.

.Sh STANDARDS
RFC 2634: Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME,
section 5: Signing Certificate Attribute
.Pp
Note that RFC 2634 has been updated by RFC 5035:
Enhanced Security Services (ESS) Update:
Adding CertID Algorithm Agility.
But the current implementation only supports the
Signing Certificate Attribute Definition Version 1
according to RFC 2634, not the
Signing Certificate Attribute Definition Version 2
according to RFC 5035.
.Sh HISTORY
These functions first appeared in OpenSSL 1.0.0
and have been available since
.Ox 4.9 .
