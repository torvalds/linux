.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_get_subject_name
returns the subject name of certificate
.Fa x .
The returned value is an internal pointer which must not be freed.
.Pp
.Fn X509_set_subject_name
sets the issuer name of certificate
.Fa x
to
.Fa name .
The
.Fa name
parameter is copied internally and should be freed up when it is no
longer needed.
.Pp
.Fn X509_get_issuer_name
and
.Fn X509_set_issuer_name
are identical to
.Fn X509_get_subject_name
and
.Fn X509_set_subject_name
except that they get and set the issuer name of
.Fa x .
.Pp
Similarly
.Fn X509_REQ_get_subject_name ,
.Fn X509_REQ_set_subject_name ,
.Fn X509_CRL_get_issuer ,
and
.Fn X509_CRL_set_issuer_name
get or set the subject or issuer names of certificate requests
of CRLs, respectively.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_get_subject_name ,
.Fn X509_get_issuer_name ,
.Fn X509_REQ_get_subject_name ,
and
.Fn X509_CRL_get_issuer
return a pointer to an
.Vt X509_NAME
object.
.Pp
.Fn X509_set_subject_name ,
.Fn X509_set_issuer_name ,
.Fn X509_REQ_set_subject_name ,
and
.Fn X509_CRL_set_issuer_name
return 1 for success or 0 for failure.
In some cases of failure, the reason can be determined with
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
