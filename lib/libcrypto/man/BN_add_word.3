.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions perform arithmetic operations on BIGNUMs with unsigned
integers.
They are much more efficient than the normal BIGNUM arithmetic
operations.
.Pp
.Vt BN_ULONG
is a macro that expands to
.Vt unsigned long Pq = Vt uint64_t
on
.Dv _LP64
platforms and
.Vt unsigned int Pq = Vt uint32_t
elsewhere.
.Pp
.Fn BN_add_word
adds
.Fa w
to
.Fa a
.Pq Li a+=w .
.Pp
.Fn BN_sub_word
subtracts
.Fa w
from
.Fa a
.Pq Li a-=w .
.Pp
.Fn BN_mul_word
multiplies
.Fa a
and
.Fa w
.Pq Li a*=w .
.Pp
.Fn BN_div_word
divides
.Fa a
by
.Fa w
.Pq Li a/=w
and returns the remainder.
.Pp
.Fn BN_mod_word
returns the remainder of
.Fa a
divided by
.Fa w
.Pq Li a%w .
.Pp
For
.Fn BN_div_word
and
.Fn BN_mod_word ,
.Fa w
must not be 0.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn BN_add_word ,
.Fn BN_sub_word ,
and
.Fn BN_mul_word
return 1 for success or 0 on error.
The error codes can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
.Pp
.Fn BN_mod_word
and
.Fn BN_div_word
return
.Fa a Ns % Ns Fa w
on success and
.Po Vt BN_ULONG Pc Ns -1
if an error occurred.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr BN_add 3 ,
.Xr BN_new 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn BN_add_word ,
.Fn BN_div_word ,
and
.Fn BN_mod_word
first appeared in SSLeay 0.5.1.
.Fn BN_sub_word
and
.Fn BN_mul_word
first appeared in SSLeay 0.9.0.
All these functions have been available since
.Ox 2.4 .
.Pp
Before 0.9.8a, the return value for
.Fn BN_div_word
and
.Fn BN_mod_word
in case of an error was 0.
