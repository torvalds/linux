.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_get_pubkey
attempts to decode the public key for certificate
.Fa x .
If successful, it returns the public key as an
.Vt EVP_PKEY
pointer with its reference count incremented: this means the returned
key must be freed up after use.
.Fn X509_get0_pubkey
is similar except that it does not increment the reference count
of the returned
.Vt EVP_PKEY ,
so it must not be freed up after use.
.Pp
.Fn X509_get_X509_PUBKEY
returns an internal pointer to the
.Vt SubjectPublicKeyInfo
structure contained in
.Fa x .
The returned value must not be freed up after use.
.Pp
.Fn X509_get0_pubkey_bitstr
returns an internal pointer to just the public key contained in this
.Vt SubjectPublicKeyInfo
structure, without the information about the algorithm used.
.Pp
.Fn X509_set_pubkey
attempts to set the public key for certificate
.Fa x
to
.Fa pkey .
The key
.Fa pkey
should be freed up after use.
.Pp
.Fn X509_REQ_get_pubkey ,
.Fn X509_REQ_get0_pubkey ,
and
.Fn X509_REQ_set_pubkey
are similar but operate on certificate request
.Fa req .
.Pp
The first time a public key is decoded, the
.Vt EVP_PKEY
structure is cached in the certificate or certificate request itself.
Subsequent calls return the cached structure with its reference count
incremented to improve performance.
.Pp
.Fn X509_extract_key
and
.Fn X509_REQ_extract_key
are deprecated aliases for
.Fn X509_get_pubkey
and
.Fn X509_REQ_get_pubkey ,
respectively, implemented as macros.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_get_pubkey ,
.Fn X509_get0_pubkey ,
.Fn X509_get_X509_PUBKEY ,
.Fn X509_get0_pubkey_bitstr ,
.Fn X509_REQ_get_pubkey ,
.Fn X509_REQ_get0_pubkey ,
.Fn X509_extract_key ,
and
.Fn X509_REQ_extract_key
return a public key or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurred.
.Pp
.Fn X509_set_pubkey
and
.Fn X509_REQ_set_pubkey
return 1 for success or 0 for failure.
.Pp
In some cases of failure of
.Fn X509_get0_pubkey ,
.Fn X509_set_pubkey ,
.Fn X509_REQ_get_pubkey ,
.Fn X509_REQ_get0_pubkey ,
and
.Fn X509_REQ_set_pubkey ,
the reason can be determined with
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn X509_get_pubkey ,
.Fn X509_get0_pubkey ,
.Fn X509_REQ_get_pubkey ,
.Fn X509_extract_key ,
and
.Fn X509_REQ_extract_key
provide diagnostics as documented for
.Xr X509_PUBKEY_get 3 .
If
.Fa x
or
.Fa req
is
.Dv NULL
or contains no certificate information,
they fail without pushing an error onto the stack.
.Pp
.Fn X509_get_X509_PUBKEY
provides no diagnostics and crashes by accessing a
.Dv NULL
pointer if
.Fa x
is
.Dv NULL
or contains no certificate information,
.Pp
.Fn X509_get0_pubkey_bitstr
provides no diagnostics
and fails without pushing an error onto the stack if
.Fa x
is
.Dv NULL ,
but it crashes by accessing a
.Dv NULL
pointer if
.Fa x
contains no certificate information.
