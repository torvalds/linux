.Dt I2D_CMS_BIO_STREAM 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm i2d_CMS_bio_stream
.Nd output CMS_ContentInfo structure in BER format
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libcrypto
.In openssl/cms.h
.Ft int
.Fo i2d_CMS_bio_stream
.Fa "BIO *out"
.Fa "CMS_ContentInfo *cms"
.Fa "BIO *data"
.Fa "int flags"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn i2d_CMS_bio_stream
outputs a
.Vt CMS_ContentInfo
structure in BER format.
.Pp
It is otherwise identical to the function
.Xr SMIME_write_CMS 3 .
.Pp
This function is effectively a version of
.Xr i2d_CMS_bio 3
supporting streaming.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn i2d_CMS_bio_stream
returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr CMS_ContentInfo_new 3 ,
.Xr CMS_encrypt 3 ,
.Xr CMS_sign 3 ,
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 ,
.Xr PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream 3 ,
.Xr SMIME_write_CMS 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn i2d_CMS_bio_stream
first appeared in OpenSSL 1.0.0
and has been available since
.Ox 6.7 .
.Sh BUGS
The prefix "i2d" is arguably wrong because the function outputs BER
format.
