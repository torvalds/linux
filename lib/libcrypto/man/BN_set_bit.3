.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn BN_set_bit
sets bit
.Fa n
in
.Fa a
to 1
.Pq Li a|=(1<<n) .
The number is expanded if necessary.
.Pp
.Fn BN_clear_bit
sets bit
.Fa n
in
.Fa a
to 0
.Pq Li a&=~(1<<n) .
An error occurs if
.Fa a
is shorter than
.Fa n
bits.
.Pp
.Fn BN_is_bit_set
tests if bit
.Fa n
in
.Fa a
is set.
.Pp
.Fn BN_mask_bits
truncates
.Fa a
to an
.Fa n
bit number
.Pq Li a&=~((~0)>>n) .
An error occurs if
.Fa a
already is shorter than
.Fa n
bits.
.Pp
.Fn BN_lshift
shifts
.Fa a
left by
.Fa n
bits and places the result in
.Fa r
.Pq Li r=a*2^n .
Note that
.Fa n
must be non-negative.
.Fn BN_lshift1
shifts
.Fa a
left by one and places the result in
.Fa r
.Pq Li r=2*a .
.Pp
.Fn BN_rshift
shifts
.Fa a
right by
.Fa n
bits and places the result in
.Fa r
.Pq Li r=a/2^n .
Note that
.Fa n
must be non-negative.
.Fn BN_rshift1
shifts
.Fa a
right by one and places the result in
.Fa r
.Pq Li r=a/2 .
.Pp
For the shift functions,
.Fa r
and
.Fa a
may be the same variable.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn BN_is_bit_set
returns 1 if the bit is set, 0 otherwise.
.Pp
All other functions return 1 for success, 0 on error.
The error codes can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
