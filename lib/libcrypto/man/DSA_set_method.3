.Sh DESCRIPTION
A
.Vt DSA_METHOD
object contains pointers to the functions used for DSA operations.
By default, the internal implementation returned by
.Fn DSA_OpenSSL
is used.
By selecting another method, alternative implementations
such as hardware accelerators may be used.
.Pp
.Fn DSA_set_default_method
selects
.Fa meth
as the default method for all
.Vt DSA
structures created later.
.Pp
.Fn DSA_get_default_method
returns a pointer to the current default method.
.Pp
.Fn DSA_set_method
selects
.Fa meth
to perform all operations using the key
.Fa dsa .
This replaces the
.Vt DSA_METHOD
used by the DSA key.
It is possible to have DSA keys that only work with certain
.Vt DSA_METHOD
implementations,
and in such cases attempting to change the
.Vt DSA_METHOD
for the key can have unexpected results.
.Pp
.Fn DSA_new_method
allocates and initializes a
.Vt DSA
structure.
The
.Fa engine
argument is ignored and
the default method controlled by
.Fn DSA_set_default_method
is used.
.Pp
The
.Vt DSA_METHOD
structure is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
struct {
	/* name of the implementation */
	const char *name;
	/* sign */
	DSA_SIG *(*dsa_do_sign)(const unsigned char *dgst, int dlen,
	    DSA *dsa);
	/* pre-compute k^-1 and r */
	int (*dsa_sign_setup)(DSA *dsa, BN_CTX *ctx_in, BIGNUM **kinvp,
	    BIGNUM **rp);
	/* verify */
	int (*dsa_do_verify)(const unsigned char *dgst, int dgst_len,
	    DSA_SIG *sig, DSA *dsa);
	/* called at DSA_new */
	int (*init)(DSA *DSA);
	/* called at DSA_free */
	int (*finish)(DSA *DSA);
	int flags;
} DSA_METHOD;
.Ed
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn DSA_OpenSSL
and
.Fn DSA_get_default_method
return pointers to the respective
.Vt DSA_METHOD .
.Pp
.Fn DSA_set_method
returns 1 on success or 0 on failure.
Currently, it cannot fail.
.Pp
.Fn DSA_new_method
returns
.Dv NULL
and sets an error code that can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3
if the allocation fails.
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.
