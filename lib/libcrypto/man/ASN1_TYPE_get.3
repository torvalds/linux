.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Vt ASN1_TYPE
data type and the
.Dv V_ASN1_ANY
type identifier constant represent the ASN.1 ANY type.
An
.Vt ASN1_TYPE
object can store an ASN.1 value of arbitrary type,
including constructed types such as a SEQUENCE.
It also remembers internally which type it currently holds.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt ASN1_TYPE
object of type
.Dv V_ASN1_UNDEF .
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_free
frees
.Fa a
including the value stored in it, if any.
If
.Fa a
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_get
returns the type currently held by
.Fa a ,
represented by one of the
.Dv V_ASN1_*
constants defined in
.In openssl/asn1.h .
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_set
frees the value contained in
.Fa a ,
if any, and sets the
.Fa value
and
.Fa type
now held in
.Fa a .
This function uses the pointer
.Fa value
internally so it must
.Sy not
be freed up after the call.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_set1
sets the type held by
.Fa a
to
.Fa type
and its value to a copy of
.Fa value .
If copying succeeds, the previous value that was contained in
.Fa a
is freed.
If copying fails,
.Fa a
remains unchanged.
.Pp
The type and meaning of the
.Fa value
argument of
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_set
and
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_set1
is determined by the
.Fa type
argument.
If
.Fa type
is
.Dv V_ASN1_NULL ,
.Fa value
is ignored.
If
.Fa type
is
.Dv V_ASN1_BOOLEAN ,
then the boolean is set to TRUE if
.Fa value
is not
.Dv NULL .
If
.Fa type
is
.Dv V_ASN1_OBJECT ,
then
.Fa value
is an
.Vt ASN1_OBJECT
structure.
Otherwise
.Fa type
is an
.Vt ASN1_STRING
structure.
If
.Fa type
corresponds to a primitive type or a string type, then the contents
of the
.Vt ASN1_STRING
contains the content octets of the type.
If
.Fa type
corresponds to a constructed type or a tagged type
.Pq Dv V_ASN1_SEQUENCE , V_ASN1_SET , No or Dv V_ASN1_OTHER ,
then the
.Vt ASN1_STRING
contains the entire ASN.1 encoding verbatim, including tag and
length octets.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_set_octetstring
allocates a new
.Vt ASN1_OCTET_STRING
object, copies
.Fa len
bytes of
.Fa data
into it using
.Xr ASN1_STRING_set 3 ,
and replaces the value of
.Fa a
with it by calling
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_set
with a type of
.Dv V_ASN1_OCTET_STRING .
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_get_octetstring
copies the contents of the
.Vt ASN1_OCTET_STRING
object contained in
.Fa a ,
but not more than
.Fa buflen
bytes, into the
.Fa buffer
provided by the caller.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_set_int_octetstring
frees the value contained in
.Fa a ,
if any, sets its type to
.Dv V_ASN1_SEQUENCE ,
and sets its value to a two-element ASN.1 sequence consisting of
an ASN.1 INTEGER object with the value
.Fa num
and an ASN.1 OCTET STRING object
containing a copy of the
.Fa len
bytes pointed to by
.Fa data .
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_get_int_octetstring
copies the integer value from the first element of the ASN.1 sequence
.Fa a
to
.Pf * Fa num
unless
.Fa num
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer and copies the octet string value from the second element,
but not more than
.Fa buflen
bytes, into the
.Fa buffer
provided by the caller unless
.Fa buffer
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_cmp
checks that
.Fa a
and
.Fa b
hold the same type, the same value, and are encoded in the same way.
.Pp
If the types agree and the values have the same meaning but are
encoded differently, they are considered different.
For example, a boolean value is represented
using a single content octet.
Under BER, any non-zero octet represents the TRUE value, but
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_cmp
will only report a match if the content octet is the same.
.Pp
If either or both of the arguments passed to
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_cmp
is
.Dv NULL ,
the result is a mismatch.
Technically, if both arguments are
.Dv NULL ,
the two types could be absent OPTIONAL fields and so should match,
however passing
.Dv NULL
values could also indicate a programming error (for example an
unparsable type which returns
.Dv NULL )
for types which do
.Sy not
match.
So applications should handle the case of two absent values separately.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_new
returns the new
.Vt ASN1_TYPE
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_get
returns the type currently held by
.Fa a
or 0 if an error occurs.
The latter can happen if
.Fa a
does not contain a value even though its type is not
.Dv V_ASN1_NULL .
For example, it will always happen for empty objects
newly constructed with
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_new .
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_set1 ,
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_set_octetstring ,
and
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_set_int_octetstring
return 1 on success or 0 on failure.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_get_octetstring
returns the number of data bytes contained in the
.Vt ASN1_OCTET_STRING
object contained in
.Fa a
or \-1 if
.Fa a
is not of the type
.Dv V_ASN1_OCTET_STRING
or does not contain any object.
If the return value is greater than the
.Fa buflen
argument, the content was truncated when copied to the
.Fa buffer .
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_get_int_octetstring
returns the number of data bytes contained in the
.Vt ASN1_OCTET_STRING
object that is the second element of the ASN.1 sequence
.Fa a
or \-1 if
.Fa a
is not of the type
.Dv V_ASN1_SEQUENCE
or if decoding fails.
If the return value is greater than the
.Fa buflen
argument, the content was truncated when copied to the
.Fa buffer .
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_TYPE_cmp
returns 0 for a match or non-zero for a mismatch.
