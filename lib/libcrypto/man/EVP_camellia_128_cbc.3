.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide the Camellia encryption algorithm in the
.Xr evp 3
framework.
Camellia is a block cipher operating on 128 bit blocks.
These functions use 128, 192, and 256-bit keys
in the following modes, respectively:
CBC, CFB with 1-bit shift, CFB with 8-bit shift, CFB with 128-bit shift,
ECB, and OFB.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_camellia_128_cfb ,
.Fn EVP_camellia_192_cfb ,
and
.Fn EVP_camellia_256_cfb
are aliases for
.Fn EVP_camellia_128_cfb128 ,
.Fn EVP_camellia_192_cfb128 ,
and
.Fn EVP_camellia_256_cfb128 ,
implemented as macros.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return an
.Vt EVP_CIPHER
structure that provides the implementation of the symmetric cipher.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr evp 3 ,
.Xr EVP_EncryptInit 3
.Sh HISTORY
These functions first appeared in OpenSSL 0.9.8c
and have been available since
.Ox 4.5 .
