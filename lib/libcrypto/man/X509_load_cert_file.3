.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_load_cert_file
with a
.Fa type
of
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_PEM
reads one or more certificates in PEM format from the given
.Fa file
using
.Xr PEM_read_bio_X509_AUX 3 ;
with a type of
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_ASN1 ,
if reads one certificate in DER format using
.Xr d2i_X509_bio 3 .
The certificates read are added to the
.Vt X509_STORE
memory cache object associated with the given
.Fa ctx
using
.Xr X509_STORE_add_cert 3 .
.Pp
.Fn X509_load_crl_file
with a
.Fa type
of
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_PEM
reads one or more certificate revocation lists in PEM format from the given
.Fa file
using
.Xr PEM_read_bio_X509_CRL 3 ;
with a type of
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_ASN1 ,
if reads one certificate revocation lists in DER format using
.Xr d2i_X509_CRL_bio 3 .
The certificate revocation lists read are added to the
.Vt X509_STORE
memory cache object associated with the given
.Fa ctx
using
.Xr X509_STORE_add_crl 3 .
.Pp
.Fn X509_load_cert_crl_file
with a
.Fa type
of
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_PEM
read one or more certificates and/or certificate revocation lists
in PEM format from the given
.Fa file
using
.Xr PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio 3
and adds them to the
.Vt X509_STORE
memory cache object associated with the given
.Fa ctx
using
.Xr X509_STORE_add_cert 3
and
.Xr X509_STORE_add_crl 3 ,
respectively.
.Pp
.Fn X509_load_cert_crl_file
with a
.Fa type
of
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_ASN1
is equivalent to
.Fn X509_load_cert_file
and cannot be used to read a certificate revocation list.
