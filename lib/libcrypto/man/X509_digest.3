.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_pubkey_digest
returns a digest of the DER representation of the public key contained in
.Fa data .
All other functions described here return a digest of the DER
representation of their entire
.Fa data
object.
.Pp
The
.Fa type
parameter specifies the digest to be used, such as
.Xr EVP_sha1 3 .
.Fa md
is a pointer to the buffer where the digest will be copied and is
assumed to be large enough; a size of at least
.Dv EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE
bytes is suggested.
The
.Fa len
parameter, if not
.Dv NULL ,
points to a place where the digest size will be stored.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return 1 for success or 0 for failure.
