.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide the DES encryption algorithm in the
.Xr evp 3
framework.
DES is a block cipher operating on 64 bit blocks.
The key length to be used for
.Xr EVP_EncryptInit 3
is 64 bits.
However, only 56 of these bits are used in the encryption algorithm.
The least significant bit in each of the eight bytes is only used
for checking parity.
Using this algorithm is discouraged because the short key length
makes it vulnerable to brute force attacks.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_des_cbc ,
.Fn EVP_des_cfb1 ,
.Fn EVP_des_cfb8 ,
.Fn EVP_des_cfb64 ,
.Fn EVP_des_ecb ,
and
.Fn EVP_des_ofb
provide DES in CBC, CFB with 1-bit shift, CFB with 8-bit shift,
CFB with 64-bit shift, ECB, and OFB modes.
.Fn EVP_des_cfb
is an alias for
.Fn EVP_des_cfb64 ,
implemented as a macro.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_des_ede_cbc ,
.Fn EVP_des_ede_cfb64 ,
.Fn EVP_des_ede_ecb ,
and
.Fn EVP_des_ede_ofb
provide two key triple DES in CBC, CFB with 64-bit shift, ECB, and OFB modes.
.Fn EVP_des_ede_cfb
is an alias for
.Fn EVP_des_ede_cfb64 ,
implemented as a macro.
.Fn EVP_des_ede
is an alias for
.Fn EVP_des_ede_ecb .
.Pp
.Fn EVP_des_ede3_cbc ,
.Fn EVP_des_ede3_cfb1 ,
.Fn EVP_des_ede3_cfb8 ,
.Fn EVP_des_ede3_cfb64 ,
.Fn EVP_des_ede3_ecb ,
.Fn EVP_des_ede3_ofb
provide three key triple DES in CBC, CFB with 1-bit shift, CFB with 8-bit
shift, CFB with 64-bit shift, ECB, and OFB modes.
.Fn EVP_des_ede3_cfb
is an alias for
.Fn EVP_des_ede3_cfb64 ,
implemented as a macro.
.Fn EVP_des_ede3
is an alias for
.Fn EVP_des_ede3_ecb .
.Pp
.Fn EVP_desx_cbc
provides the DES-X encryption algorithm in CBC mode.
It uses a key length of 128 bits and acts on blocks of 128 bits.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return an
.Vt EVP_CIPHER
structure that provides the implementation of the symmetric cipher.
