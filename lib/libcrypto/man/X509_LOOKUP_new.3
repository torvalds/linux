.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_free
is a deprecated function that
releases the memory used by
.Fa lookup .
It is provided for compatibility only.
If
.Fa lookup
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Pp
The operation of
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_ctrl
depends on the
.Vt X509_LOOKUP_METHOD
used by
.Fa lookup :
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Xr X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir 3
The
.Fa command
is required to be
.Dv X509_L_ADD_DIR
and the
.Fa source
argument is interpreted
as a colon-separated, NUL-terminated list of directory names.
These directories are added to an internal list of directories to search
for certificate files of the given
.Fa type .
.Pp
If
.Fa type
is
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_DEFAULT ,
the
.Fa source
argument is ignored and
.Pa /etc/ssl/certs
and a type of
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_PEM
are used instead.
.Pp
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_add_dir
is a macro that calls
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_ctrl
with a
.Fa command
of
.Dv X509_L_ADD_DIR
and
.Fa ret
set to
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
This lookup method is peculiar in so far as calling
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_ctrl
on a lookup object using it does not yet add any certificates to the associated
.Vt X509_STORE
object.
.It Xr X509_LOOKUP_file 3
The
.Fa command
is required to be
.Dv X509_L_FILE_LOAD
and the
.Fa source
argument is interpreted as a NUL-terminated file name.
If the
.Fa type
is
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_PEM ,
the file is read with
.Xr BIO_new_file 3
and
.Xr PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio 3
and the certificates and revocation lists found are added to the
.Vt X509_STORE
object associated with
.Fa lookup
using
.Xr X509_STORE_add_cert 3
and
.Xr X509_STORE_add_crl 3 .
If
.Fa type
is
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_DEFAULT ,
the
.Fa source
argument is ignored and
.Pa /etc/ssl/certs.pem
and a type of
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_PEM
are used instead.
If
.Fa type
is
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_ASN1 ,
the file is read with
.Xr d2i_X509_bio 3
and the single certificate is added to the
.Vt X509_STORE
object associated with
.Fa lookup
using
.Xr X509_STORE_add_cert 3 .
.Pp
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_load_file
is a macro calling
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_ctrl
with a
.Fa command
of
.Dv X509_L_FILE_LOAD
and
.Fa ret
set to
.Dv NULL .
.It Xr X509_LOOKUP_mem 3
The
.Fa command
and
.Fa type
are required to be
.Dv X509_L_MEM
and
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_PEM ,
respectively.
The
.Fa source
argument is interpreted as a pointer to an
.Vt iovec
structure defined in
.In sys/uio.h .
The memory area described by that structure is read with
.Xr BIO_new_mem_buf 3
and
.Xr PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio 3
and the certificates and revocation lists found are added to the
.Vt X509_STORE
object associated with
.Fa lookup
using
.Xr X509_STORE_add_cert 3
and
.Xr X509_STORE_add_crl 3 .
.Pp
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_add_mem
is a macro calling
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_ctrl
with a command of
.Dv X509_L_MEM
and
.Fa ret
set to
.Dv NULL .
.El
.Pp
With LibreSSL,
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_ctrl
always ignores the
.Fa ret
argument.
.Pp
If the
.Fa type
is
.Dv X509_LU_X509 ,
it searches the configured directories for files having that name,
with a file name extension that is a small, non-negative decimal integer
starting at
.Qq ".0" .
These files are read with
.Xr X509_load_cert_file 3 .
In each directory, the search is ended once a file with the expected name
and extension does not exists.
.Pp
If the
.Fa type
is
.Dv X509_LU_CRL ,
the file name extensions are expected to have a prefix of
.Qq "r" ,
i.e. they start with
.Qq ".r0" ,
and the files are read with
.Xr X509_load_crl_file 3 .
.Pp
In case of success, the first match is returned in the
.Pf * Fa object
provided by the caller, overwriting any previous content.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_ctrl
returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.
With library implementations other than LibreSSL,
it might also return \-1 for internal errors.
.Pp
.Fn X509_get_default_cert_dir
returns a pointer to the constant string
.Qq /etc/ssl/certs ,
.Fn X509_get_default_cert_file
to
.Qq /etc/ssl/certs.pem ,
.Fn X509_get_default_cert_dir_env
to
.Qq SSL_CERT_DIR ,
and
.Fn X509_get_default_cert_file_env
to
.Qq SSL_CERT_FILE .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
For reasons of security and simplicity,
LibreSSL ignores the environment variables
.Ev SSL_CERT_DIR
and
.Ev SSL_CERT_FILE ,
but other library implementations may use their contents instead
of the standard locations for trusted certificates, and a few
third-party application programs also inspect these variables
directly and may pass their values to
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_add_dir
and
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_load_file .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/ssl/certs.pem -compact
.It Pa /etc/ssl/certs/
default directory for storing trusted certificates
.It Pa /etc/ssl/certs.pem
default file for storing trusted certificates
.El

.Xr ERR_get_error 3 ,
.Xr ERR_GET_REASON 3 ,
and
.Xr ERR_reason_error_string 3 :

causes failure but provides no diagnostics.

.Sh BUGS
If the
.Fa type
is
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_DEFAULT
or
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_PEM ,
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_ctrl
with
.Dv X509_L_FILE_LOAD
and
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_load_file
silently ignore failure of
.Xr X509_STORE_add_cert 3
and
.Xr X509_STORE_add_crl 3
and indicate success anyway.
.Pp
Handling of a
.Dv NULL
.Fa source
is inconsistent for
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_ctrl
with
.Dv X509_L_FILE_LOAD
and for
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_load_file .
With
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_PEM ,
it causes failure, but with
.Dv X509_FILETYPE_ASN1 ,
no action occurs and success is indicated.
.Pp
When called on a
.Fa lookup
object using
.Xr X509_LOOKUP_mem 3 ,
.Fn X509_LOOKUP_ctrl
raises
.Dv ERR_R_PEM_LIB
when called with an invalid
.Fa command
or
.Fa type ,
when
.Xr BIO_new_mem_buf 3
fails, when
.Fa source
contains zero objects, or when
.Xr X509_STORE_add_cert 3
fails on the first object encountered, which is all inconsistent
with the behaviour of the other lookup methods.
