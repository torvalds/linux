.Fn ASN1_UNIVERSALSTRING_to_string
fails and leaves the
.Fa string
unchanged if its
.Xr ASN1_STRING_type 3
is not
.Dv V_ASN1_UNIVERSALSTRING ,
if its
.Xr ASN1_STRING_length 3
is not a multiple of four bytes,
or if any of its characters cannot be represented in ISO Latin-1.
.Pp
In case of success, the
.Xr ASN1_STRING_length 3
of the
.Fa string
is reduced by a factor of four.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn ASN1_UNIVERSALSTRING_to_string
returns 1 on success or 0 on failure.
