.Sh DESCRIPTION
Even though the X.501
.Vt Name
documented in
.Xr X509_NAME_new 3
is a complicated multi-layered structure, it is very rigid and not
flexible enough to represent various entities that many people want
to use as names in certificates.
For that reason, X.509 extensions use the X.509
.Vt GeneralName
wrapper structure rather than using the X.501
.Vt Name
structure directly, at the expense of adding one or two additional
layers of indirection.
.Pp
.Fn GENERAL_NAME_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt GENERAL_NAME
object, representing the ASN.1
.Vt GeneralName
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.6.
It can for example hold an
.Vt X509_name
object, an IP address, a DNS host name, a uniform resource identifier,
an email address, or an
.Vt EDIPARTYNAME
or
.Vt OTHERNAME
object described below.
.Fn GENERAL_NAME_free
frees
.Fa name .
.Pp
.Fn GENERAL_NAMES_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt GENERAL_NAMES
object, which is a
.Vt STACK_OF(GENERAL_NAME)
and represents the ASN.1
.Vt GeneralNames
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.6.
It is used by extension structures that can contain multiple names,
for example key identifier, alternative name, and distribution point
extensions.
.Fn GENERAL_NAMES_free
frees
.Fa names .
.Pp
.Fn EDIPARTYNAME_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt EDIPARTYNAME
object, representing the ASN.1
.Vt EDIPartyName
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.6, where
.Dq EDI
stands for
.Dq electronic data identifier .
It can hold two strings, the name itself and the name of the authority
that assigned that name.
.Fn EDIPARTYNAME_free
frees
.Fa name .
.Pp
.Fn OTHERNAME_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt OTHERNAME
object, representing the ASN.1
.Vt OtherName
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.6.
It can hold data of any
.Vt ASN1_TYPE
together with a type identifier.
.Fn OTHERNAME_free
frees
.Fa name .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn GENERAL_NAME_new ,
.Fn GENERAL_NAMES_new ,
.Fn EDIPARTYNAME_new ,
and
.Fn OTHERNAME_new
return a new
.Vt GENERAL_NAME ,
.Vt GENERAL_NAMES ,
.Vt EDIPARTYNAME ,
or
.Vt OTHERNAME
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
