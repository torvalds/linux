.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn d2i_PKEY_USAGE_PERIOD
and
.Fn i2d_PKEY_USAGE_PERIOD
decode and encode an ASN.1
.Vt PrivateKeyUsagePeriod
structure defined in RFC 3280 section 4.2.1.4.
For details about the semantics, examples, caveats, and bugs, see
.Xr ASN1_item_d2i 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn d2i_PKEY_USAGE_PERIOD
returns a
.Vt PKEY_USAGE_PERIOD
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_PKEY_USAGE_PERIOD
returns the number of bytes successfully encoded or a negative value
if an error occurs.
