.Sh NAME

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libcrypto

.Ft int
.Fo X509_check_private_key
.Fa "const X509 *x"
.Fa "const EVP_PKEY *k"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are seriously misnamed.
.Fn X509_check_private_key
compares the
.Em public
key components (e.g. exponent and modulus of an RSA key)
and parameters (e.g. EC params of an EC key) of
.Fa k
with the corresponding properties of
.Fa x .
Despite the name, it neither checks whether
.Fa k
contains private key components at all, nor, if any are present,
whether they are consistent with the public key components.
.Pp
.Fn X509_REQ_check_private_key
is equivalent to
.Fn X509_check_private_key
except that it compares to the public key
contained in a certificate request.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return 1 if the public key components and parameters
match, or 0 if they do not or if an error occurs.
On error or mismatch, a reason code can be obtained using
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
