.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_sign
signs the certificate
.Fa x
using the private key
.Fa pkey
and the message digest
.Fa md
and sets the signature in
.Fa x .
.Fn X509_sign_ctx
also signs the certificate
.Fa x
but uses the parameters contained in digest context
.Fa ctx .
.Pp
.Fn X509_verify
verifies the signature of certificate
.Fa x
using the public key
.Fa pkey .
Only the signature is checked: no other checks (such as certificate
chain validity) are performed.
.Pp
.Fn X509_REQ_sign ,
.Fn X509_REQ_sign_ctx ,
.Fn X509_REQ_verify ,
.Fn X509_CRL_sign ,
.Fn X509_CRL_sign_ctx ,
and
.Fn X509_CRL_verify
sign and verify certificate requests and CRLs, respectively.
.Pp
.Fn X509_sign_ctx
is used where the default parameters for the corresponding public key
and digest are not suitable.
It can be used to sign keys using RSA-PSS for example.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_sign ,
.Fn X509_sign_ctx ,
.Fn X509_REQ_sign ,
.Fn X509_REQ_sign_ctx ,
.Fn X509_CRL_sign ,
and
.Fn X509_CRL_sign_ctx
return the size of the signature in bytes for success or 0 for failure.
.Pp
.Fn X509_verify ,
.Fn X509_REQ_verify ,
and
.Fn X509_CRL_verify
return 1 if the signature is valid or 0 if the signature check fails.
If the signature could not be checked at all because it was invalid or
some other error occurred, then -1 is returned.
.Pp
In some cases of failure, the reason can be determined with
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
