.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_STORE_set_verify_cb
sets the verification callback of
.Sy ctx
to
.Sy verify_cb ,
overwriting any existing callback.
.Pp
.Fn X509_STORE_set_verify_cb_func
also sets the verification callback but it is implemented as a macro.
.Pp
The verification callback from an
.Vt X509_STORE
is inherited by the corresponding
.Vt X509_STORE_CTX
structure when it is initialized.
This can be used to set the verification callback when the
.Vt X509_STORE_CTX
is otherwise inaccessible (for example during S/MIME verification).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_STORE_get_verify_cb
returns the function pointer set with
.Fn X509_STORE_set_verify_cb ,
or
.Dv NULL
if that function was not called on
.Fa st .
