.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_signature_dump
writes the data bytes contained in the
.Fa signature
to
.Fa bio
in hexadecimal format with colons between bytes,
18 bytes per output line, each line indented with
.Fa indent
space characters.
.Pp
.Fn X509_signature_print
writes the name of the signature
.Fa algorithm ,
or, if no name for it is known, its object identifier (OID) to
.Fa bio
using
.Xr i2a_ASN1_OBJECT 3 .
After that, if a method object for the algorithm can be retrieved with
.Xr EVP_PKEY_asn1_find 3
and if that object defines a printing method, that printing method is
used to print the
.Fa signature .
Otherwise, unless the
.Fa signature
is
.Dv NULL ,
it is printed using
.Fn X509_signature_dump .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return 1 on success or 0 on failure.
They fail and return as soon as any write operation fails.
