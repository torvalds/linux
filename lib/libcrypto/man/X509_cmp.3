.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_cmp
compares two X.509 certificates using
.Xr memcmp 3
on the hashes of their canonical (DER) representations as generated with
.Xr X509_digest 3 .
The digest function is implementation-specific: LibreSSL uses SHA-512, other
implementations use SHA-1.
.Pp
.Fn X509_NAME_cmp
compares two X.501
.Vt Name
objects using their canonical (DER) representations generated with
.Xr i2d_X509_NAME 3 .
.Pp
.Fn X509_issuer_and_serial_cmp
compares the
.Fa issuer
and
.Fa serialNumber
fields of two
.Vt TBSCertificate
structures, using
.Fn X509_NAME_cmp
for the
.Fa issuer
fields.
.Pp
.Fn X509_issuer_name_cmp
compares the
.Fa issuer
fields of two
.Vt TBSCertificate
structures using
.Fn X509_NAME_cmp .
.Pp
.Fn X509_subject_name_cmp
compares the
.Fa subject
fields of two
.Vt TBSCertificate
structures using
.Fn X509_NAME_cmp .
.Pp
.Fn X509_CRL_cmp
is misnamed; it only compares the
.Fa issuer
fields of two
.Vt TBSCertList
structures using
.Fn X509_NAME_cmp .
.Pp
.Fn X509_CRL_match
compares two certificate revocation lists using
.Xr memcmp 3
on the hashes of their canonical (DER) representations as generated with
.Xr X509_CRL_digest 3 .
The digest function is implementation-specific: LibreSSL uses SHA-512, other
implementations use SHA-1.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
All these functions return 0 to indicate a match or a non-zero value
to indicate a mismatch.
.Pp
.Fn X509_NAME_cmp ,
.Fn X509_issuer_and_serial_cmp ,
.Fn X509_issuer_name_cmp ,
.Fn X509_subject_name_cmp
and
.Fn X509_CRL_cmp
may return -2 to indicate an error.

first appeared in SSLeay 0.5.1 and
.Fn X509_NAME_cmp
and
.Fn X509_CRL_cmp
in SSLeay 0.8.0.

.Sh BUGS
For
.Fn X509_NAME_cmp ,
.Fn X509_issuer_and_serial_cmp ,
.Fn X509_issuer_name_cmp ,
.Fn X509_subject_name_cmp
and
.Fn X509_CRL_cmp ,
the return value -2 sometimes indicates a mismatch and sometimes an error.
