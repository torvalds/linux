.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn DH_size
returns the Diffie-Hellman prime size in bytes.
It can be used to determine how much memory must be allocated for the
shared secret computed by
.Xr DH_compute_key 3 .
.Pp
.Fn DH_bits
returns the number of significant bits in the key.
.Pp
.Fa dh
and
.Fa dh->p
must not be
.Dv NULL .
