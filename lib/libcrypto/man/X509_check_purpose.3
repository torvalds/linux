.Lb libcrypto

.Sh DESCRIPTION
If the
.Fa purpose
argument is \-1,
.Fn X509_check_purpose
ignores the
.Fa ca
argument and checks that all the extensions of the
.Fa certificate
can be parsed and pass minimal sanity checks, ensuring that
no extension occurs more than once.
It also makes sure that all extensions are cached in the
.Vt X509
object.
.Pp
If the
.Fa purpose
argument is not \-1 and the
.Fa ca
flag is 0,
.Fn X509_check_purpose
also checks whether the public key contained in the
.Fa certificate
is intended to be used for the given
.Fa purpose ,
which can be one of the following integer constants.
The check succeeds if none of the conditions given in the list below
are violated.
It always fails if parsing fails for any extension contained in the
.Fa certificate .

This extension is marked as critical.

.El
.Pp
If the
.Fa purpose
argument is not \-1 and the

flag is non-zero,
.Fn X509_check_purpose
instead checks, in addition to the minimal sanity checks, whether the
.Fa certificate
can be used as a certificate authority certificate
in the context of the given
.Fa purpose .
To succeed, the check always requires that none of the following
conditions are violated:
