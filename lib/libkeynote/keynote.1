.Sh DESCRIPTION
For more details on
.Nm KeyNote ,
see RFC 2704.
.Sh KEY GENERATION
.Nm
.Cm keygen
creates a public/private key of size
.Ar KeySize
(in bits), for the algorithm specified by
.Ar AlgorithmName .
Typical keysizes are 512, 1024, or 2048 (bits).
The minimum key size for DSA keys is 512 (bits).
Supported
.Ar AlgorithmName
identifiers are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It dsa-hex:
.It dsa-base64:
.It rsa-hex:
.It rsa-base64:
.El
.Pp
Notice that the trailing colon is required.
The resulting public key is stored in file
.Ar PublicKeyFile .
Similarly, the resulting private key is stored in file
.Ar PrivateKeyFile .
Either of the filenames can be specified to be
.Sq - ,
in which case the corresponding key(s) will be printed to standard output.
.Pp
The optional parameters
.Ar print-offset
and
.Ar print-length
specify the offset from the beginning of the line where the key
will be printed, and the number of characters of the key that will
be printed per line.
.Ar print-length
includes
.Ar AlgorithmName
for the first line and has to be longer (by at least 2) than
.Ar AlgorithmName .
.Ar print-length
also accounts for the line-continuation character (backslash) at
the end of each line, and the double quotes at the beginning and end
of the key encoding.
Default values are 12 and 50 respectively.
.Sh ASSERTION SIGNING
.Nm
.Cm sign
reads the assertion contained in
.Ar AssertionFile
and generates a signature specified by
.Ar AlgorithmName
using the private key stored in
.Ar PrivateKeyFile .
The private key is expected to be of the form output by
.Nm
.Cm keygen .
The private key algorithm and the
.Ar AlgorithmName
specified as an argument are expected to match.
There is no requirement for the internal or ASCII encodings to match.
Valid
.Ar AlgorithmName
identifiers are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It sig-dsa-sha1-hex:
.It sig-dsa-sha1-base64:
.It sig-rsa-sha1-hex:
.It sig-rsa-sha1-base64:
.It sig-rsa-md5-hex:
.It sig-rsa-md5-base64:
.It sig-x509-sha1-hex:
.It sig-x509-sha1-base64:
.El
.Pp
Notice that the trailing colon is required.
The resulting signature is printed to standard output.
This can then be added (via cut-and-paste or some script) at the end of the
assertion, in the
.Ar Signature
field.
.Pp
The public key corresponding to the private key in
.Ar PrivateKeyFile
is expected to already be included in the
.Ar Authorizer
field of the assertion, either directly or indirectly (i.e., through
use of a
.Ar Local-Constants
attribute).
Furthermore, the assertion must have a
.Ar Signature
field (even if it is empty), as the signature is computed on
everything between the
.Ar KeyNote-Version
and
.Ar Signature
keywords (inclusive), and the
.Ar AlgorithmName
string.
.Pp
If the
.Fl v
flag is provided,
.Nm
.Cm sign
will also verify the newly-created signature using the
.Ar Authorizer
field key.
.Pp
The optional parameters
.Ar print-offset
and
.Ar print-length
specify the offset from the beginning of the line where the signature
will be printed, and the number of characters of the signature that will
be printed per line.
.Ar print-length
includes
.Ar AlgorithmName
for the first line and has to be longer (by at least 2) than
.Ar AlgorithmName .
.Ar print-length
also accounts for the line-continuation character (backslash) at
the end of each line, and the double quotes at the beginning and end
of the signature encoding.
Default values are 12 and 50 respectively.
.Sh SIGNATURE VERIFICATION
.Nm
.Cm sigver
reads the assertions contained in
.Ar AssertionFile
and verifies the public-key signatures on all of them.
.Sh QUERY TOOL
For each operand that names a
.Ar file ,
.Nm
.Cm verify
reads the file and parses the assertions contained therein (one assertion
per file).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "retlist"
.It Fl e Ar file
Specify a file containing environment variables and their values,
in the following format:
.Pp
.Dl varname = \&"value\&"
.Pp
.Ar varname
can begin with any letter (upper or lower case) or number,
and can contain underscores.
.Ar value
is a quoted string, and can contain any character, and escape
(backslash) processing is performed, as specified in the KeyNote
RFC.
.It Fl h
Print a usage message and exit.
.It Fl k Ar file
Add a key from
.Ar file
in the action authorizers.
.It Fl l Ar file
Specify a file containing trusted assertions (no signature
verification is performed), and the
.Ar Authorizer
field can contain non-key principals.
There should be at least one assertion with the
.Ar POLICY
keyword in the
.Ar Authorizer
field.
.It Fl r Ar retlist
Specify a comma-separated list of return values, in
increasing order of compliance from left to right.
.El
.Pp
Exactly one
.Fl r
and at least one each of the
.Fl e ,
.Fl l ,
and
.Fl k
flags should be given per invocation.
If no flags are given,
.Nm
.Cm verify
prints the usage message and exits with error code \-1.
.Pp
.Nm
.Cm verify
exits with code \-1 if there was an error, and 0 on success.
