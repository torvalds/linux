.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn log ,
.Fn logf ,
and
.Fn logl
functions compute the natural logarithm of
.Fa x .
.Pp
The
.Fn log10 ,
.Fn log10f ,
and
.Fn log10l
functions compute the logarithm base 10 of
.Fa x ,
while
.Fn log2 ,
.Fn log2f ,
and
.Fn log2l
compute the logarithm base 2 of
.Fa x .
.Pp
The
.Fn log1p ,
.Fn log1pf ,
and
.Fn log1pl
functions compute the natural logarithm of
.No "1 + x" .
Computing the natural logarithm as
.Li log1p(x)
is more accurate than computing it as
.Li log(1 + x)
when
.Fa x
is close to zero.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return the requested logarithm; the logarithm of 1 is +0.
An attempt to take the logarithm of \*(Pm0 results in a divide-by-zero
exception, and -\*(If is returned.
Otherwise, attempting to take the logarithm of a negative number
results in an invalid exception and a return value of \*(Na.
