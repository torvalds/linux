.Sh NAME
.Nm cos ,
.Nm cosf ,
.Nm cosl
.Nd cosine functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn cos "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn cosf "float x"
.Ft long double
.Fn cosl "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cos ,
.Fn cosf ,
and
.Fn cosl
functions compute the cosine of
.Fa x
(measured in radians).
A large magnitude argument may yield a result with little or no
significance.
For a discussion of error due to roundoff, see
.Xr math 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn cos ,
.Fn cosf ,
and
.Fn cosl
functions return the cosine value.
