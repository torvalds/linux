.Sh NAME
.Nm asin ,
.Nm asinf ,
.Nm asinl
.Nd arc sine functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn asin "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn asinf "float x"
.Ft long double
.Fn asinl "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn asin ,
.Fn asinf ,
and
.Fn asinl
functions compute the principal value of the arc sine of
.Fa x .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return the arc sine in the range
.Bk -words
.Bq -\*(Pi/2 , +\*(Pi/2
.Ek
radians.
If:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
.Pf \&| Ns Ar x Ns \&| > 1
.Ed
.Pp
.Fn asin x
raises an invalid exception and returns an \*(Na.
