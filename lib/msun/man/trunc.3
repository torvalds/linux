.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn trunc "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn truncf "float x"
.Ft "long double"
.Fn truncl "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn trunc ,
.Fn truncf ,
and
.Fn truncl
functions return the nearest integral value with magnitude less than
or equal to
.Pf | Fa x Ns | .
They are equivalent to
.Fn rint ,
.Fn rintf ,
and
.Fn rintl ,
respectively, in the
.Dv FE_TOWARDZERO
rounding mode.
