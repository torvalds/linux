.Sh NAME
.Nm math
.Nd "floating-point mathematical library"
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The math library includes the following components:
.Bl -column "<complex.h>" "polymorphic (type-generic) versions of functions" -compact -offset indent
.In math.h Ta basic routines and real-valued functions
.In complex.h Ta complex number support
.In tgmath.h Ta polymorphic (type-generic) versions of functions
.In fenv.h Ta routines to control rounding and exceptions
.El
The rest of this manual page describes the functions provided by
.In math.h .
Please consult
.Xr complex 3 ,
.Xr tgmath 3 ,
and
.Xr fenv 3
for information on the other components.
.Sh "LIST OF FUNCTIONS"
Each of the following
.Vt double
functions has a
.Vt float
counterpart with an
.Ql f
appended to the name and a
.Vt "long double"
counterpart with an
.Ql l
appended.
As an example, the
.Vt float
and
.Vt "long double"
counterparts of
.Ft double
.Fn acos "double x"
are
.Ft float
.Fn acosf "float x"
and
.Ft "long double"
.Fn acosl "long double x" ,
respectively.
The classification macros and silent order predicates are type generic and
should not be suffixed with
.Ql f
or
.Ql l .

.Pp
The routines
in this section might not produce a result that is correctly rounded,
so reproducible results cannot be guaranteed across platforms.
For most of these functions, however, incorrect rounding occurs
rarely, and then only in very-close-to-halfway cases.

.Sh HISTORY
A math library with many of the present functions appeared in
.At v7 .
The library was substantially rewritten for
.Bx 4.3
to provide
better accuracy and speed on machines supporting either VAX
or IEEE 754 floating-point.
Most of this library was replaced with FDLIBM, developed at Sun
Microsystems, in
.Fx 1.1.5 .
Additional routines, including ones for
.Vt float
and
.Vt long double
values, were written for or imported into subsequent versions of FreeBSD.
.Sh BUGS
Many of the routines to compute transcendental functions produce
inaccurate results in other than the default rounding mode.
.Pp
On the i386 platform, trigonometric argument reduction is not
performed accurately for huge arguments, resulting in
large errors
for such arguments to
.Fn cos ,
.Fn sin ,
and
.Fn tan .
