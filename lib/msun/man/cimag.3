.Sh DESCRIPTION
Let
.Sm off
.Fa a + b * Em i
.Sm on
denote the complex number
.Fa z .
.Pp
The
.Fn creal
functions return the real part
.Fa a ,
and the
.Fn cimag
functions return the imaginary part
.Fa b .
.Pp
The
.Fn conj
functions return the complex conjugate
.Sm off
.Fa a - b * Em i .
.Sm on
.Pp
The
.Fn cproj
functions return the projection onto the Riemann sphere.
If
.Fa z
contains an infinite component, then the result is
.Fa \*(If \*(Pm 0 Ns * Ns Em i ,
where the (zero) imaginary part of the result has the same sign as
.Fa b .
Otherwise, the result is
.Fa z .
.Pp
These functions do not signal any floating point exceptions.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn cimag ,
.Fn conj ,
.Fn cproj ,
and
.Fn creal
functions conform to
.St -isoC-99 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn cimag ,
.Fn conj
and
.Fn creal
functions first appeared in
.Fx 5.3 .
The
.Fn cproj
functions appeared in
.Fx 8.0 .
