.Sh NAME
.Nm cbrt ,
.Nm cbrtf ,
.Nm cbrtl ,
.Nm sqrt ,
.Nm sqrtf ,
.Nm sqrtl
.Nd cube root and square root functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn cbrt "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn cbrtf "float x"
.Ft long double
.Fn cbrtl "long double x"
.Ft double
.Fn sqrt "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn sqrtf "float x"
.Ft long double
.Fn sqrtl "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cbrt ,
.Fn cbrtf ,
and
.Fn cbrtl
functions compute
the cube root of
.Ar x .
.Pp
The
.Fn sqrt ,
.Fn sqrtf ,
and
.Fn sqrtl
functions compute the
non-negative square root of
.Ar x .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn cbrt ,
.Fn cbrtf ,
and
.Fn cbrtl
functions return the requested cube root.
The
.Fn sqrt ,
.Fn sqrtf ,
and
.Fn sqrtl
functions return the requested square root
unless an error occurs.
An attempt to take the
.Fn sqrt
of negative
.Fa x
raises an invalid exception and causes an \*(Na to be returned
(except that the square root of -0 is valid and equal to -0.)
