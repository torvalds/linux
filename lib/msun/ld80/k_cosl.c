/*
 * Domain [-0.7854, 0.7854], range ~[-2.43e-23, 2.425e-23]:
 * |cos(x) - c(x)| < 2**-75.1
 *
 * The coefficients of c(x) were generated by a pari-gp script using
 * a Remez algorithm that searches for the best higher coefficients
 * after rounding leading coefficients to a specified precision.
 *
 * Simpler methods like Chebyshev or basic Remez barely suffice for
 * cos() in 64-bit precision, because we want the coefficient of x^2
 * to be precisely -0.5 so that multiplying by it is exact, and plain
 * rounding of the coefficients of a good polynomial approximation only
 * gives this up to about 64-bit precision.  Plain rounding also gives
 * a mediocre approximation for the coefficient of x^4, but a rounding
 * error of 0.5 ulps for this coefficient would only contribute ~0.01
 * ulps to the final error, so this is unimportant.  Rounding errors in
 * higher coefficients are even less important.
 *
 * In fact, coefficients above the x^4 one only need to have 53-bit
 * precision, and this is more efficient.  We get this optimization
 * almost for free from the complications needed to search for the best
 * higher coefficients.
