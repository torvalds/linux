 * We save and restore the floating-point environment to avoid raising
 * an inexact exception.  We can get away with using fesetenv()
 * instead of feclearexcept()/feupdateenv() to restore the environment
 * because the only exception defined for rint() is overflow, and
 * rounding can't overflow as long as emax >= p.
 *
 * The volatile keyword is needed below because clang incorrectly assumes
 * that rint won't raise any floating-point exceptions. Declaring ret volatile
 * is sufficient to trick the compiler into doing the right thing.
