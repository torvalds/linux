.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm radius.conf
.Nd RADIUS client configuration file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /etc/radius.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
contains the information necessary to configure the RADIUS client
library.
It is parsed by
.Xr rad_config 3 .
The file contains one or more lines of text, each describing a
single RADIUS server which will be used by the library.
Leading
white space is ignored, as are empty lines and lines containing
only comments.
.Pp
A RADIUS server is described by three to seven fields on a line:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
Service type
.It
Server host
.It
Shared secret
.It
Timeout
.It
Retries
.It
Dead time
.It
Bind address
.El
.Pp
The fields are separated by white space.
The
.Ql #
character at the beginning of a field begins a comment, which extends
to the end of the line.
A field may be enclosed in double quotes,
in which case it may contain white space and/or begin with the
.Ql #
character.
Within a quoted string, the double quote character can
be represented by
.Ql \e\&" ,
and the backslash can be represented by
.Ql \e\e .
No other escape sequences are supported.
.Pp
The first field gives the service type, either
.Ql auth
for RADIUS authentication or
.Ql acct
for RADIUS accounting.
If a single server provides both services, two
lines are required in the file.
Earlier versions of this file did
not include a service type.
For backward compatibility, if the first
field is not
.Ql auth
or
.Ql acct
the library behaves as if
.Ql auth
were specified, and interprets the fields in the line as if they
were fields two through five.
.Pp
The second field specifies
the server host, either as a fully qualified domain name or as a
dotted-quad IP address.
The host may optionally be followed by a
.Ql \&:
and a numeric port number, without intervening white space.
If the
port specification is omitted, it defaults to the
.Ql radius
or
.Ql radacct
service in the
.Pa /etc/services
file for service types
.Ql auth
and
.Ql acct ,
respectively.
If no such entry is present, the standard ports 1812 and 1813 are
used.
.Pp
The third field contains the shared secret, which should be known
only to the client and server hosts.
It is an arbitrary string of
characters, though it must be enclosed in double quotes if it
contains white space.
The shared secret may be
any length, but the RADIUS protocol uses only the first 128
characters.
N.B., some popular RADIUS servers have bugs which
prevent them from working properly with secrets longer than 16
characters.
.Pp
The fourth field contains a decimal integer specifying the timeout in
seconds for receiving a valid reply from the server.
If this field
is omitted, it defaults to 3 seconds.
.Pp
The fifth field contains a decimal integer specifying the maximum
number of attempts that will be made to authenticate with the server
before giving up.
If omitted, it defaults to 3 attempts.
Note,
this is the total number of attempts and not the number of retries.
.Pp
The sixth field contains a decimal integer specifying a time interval
in seconds when the server will not requested if it was inaccessible
on the last try. 0 means ask always.
.Pp
The seventh field contains an IP address on multihomed host. All
requests will be binded to this IP.
.Pp
Up to 10 RADIUS servers may be specified for each service type.
The servers are tried in
round-robin fashion, until a valid response is received or the
maximum number of tries has been reached for all servers.
.Pp
The standard location for this file is
.Pa /etc/radius.conf .
But an alternate pathname may be specified in the call to
.Xr rad_config 3 .
Since the file contains sensitive information in the form of the
shared secrets, it should not be readable except by root.

# A simple entry using all the defaults:
acct  radius1.domain.com  OurLittleSecret

# A server still using the obsolete RADIUS port, with increased
# timeout and maximum tries:
auth  auth.domain.com:1645  "I can't see you"  5  4

# As above but set dead time and bind address
auth  auth.domain.com:1645  "I can't see you"  5  4  60  192.168.1.8

# A server specified by its IP address:
auth  192.168.27.81  $X*#..38947ax-+=
