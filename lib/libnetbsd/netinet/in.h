/*
 * Local port number conventions:
 *
 * Ports < IPPORT_RESERVED are reserved for privileged processes (e.g. root),
 * unless a kernel is compiled with IPNOPRIVPORTS defined.
 *
 * When a user does a bind(2) or connect(2) with a port number of zero,
 * a non-conflicting local port address is chosen.
 *
 * The default range is IPPORT_ANONMIN to IPPORT_ANONMAX, although
 * that is settable by sysctl(3); net.inet.ip.anonportmin and
 * net.inet.ip.anonportmax respectively.
 *
 * A user may set the IPPROTO_IP option IP_PORTRANGE to change this
 * default assignment range.
 *
 * The value IP_PORTRANGE_DEFAULT causes the default behavior.
 *
 * The value IP_PORTRANGE_HIGH is the same as IP_PORTRANGE_DEFAULT,
 * and exists only for FreeBSD compatibility purposes.
 *
 * The value IP_PORTRANGE_LOW changes the range to the "low" are
 * that is (by convention) restricted to privileged processes.
 * This convention is based on "vouchsafe" principles only.
 * It is only secure if you trust the remote host to restrict these ports.
 * The range is IPPORT_RESERVEDMIN to IPPORT_RESERVEDMAX.
