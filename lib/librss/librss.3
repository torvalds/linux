.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library and the functions it provides are used for both fetching
the system RSS configuration and interacting with RSS aware
sockets.
.Pp
Applications will typically call
.Fn rss_config_get
to fetch the current RSS configuration from the system and perform
initial setup.
This typically involves spawning worker threads, one per RSS bucket,
and optionally binding them to the per-bucket CPU set.
.Pp
The
.Vt rss_config
struct is defined as:
.Bd -literal
struct rss_config {
	int rss_ncpus;
	int rss_nbuckets;
	int rss_basecpu;
	int *rss_bucket_map;
};
.Ed
.Pp
Applications will typically use the
.Fn rss_config_get_bucket_count
function to fetch the number of RSS buckets, create one thread
per RSS bucket for RSS aware work, then one RSS aware socket to receive
UDP datagrams or TCP connections
in each particular RSS bucket / thread.
.Pp
The
.Fn rss_get_bucket_cpuset
function sets the given cpuset up for the given
RSS bucket and behaviour.
Typically applications will wish to just query for
.Vt RSS_BUCKET_TYPE_KERNEL_ALL
unless they wish to potentially setup different
worker threads for transmit and receive.
.Pp
The
.Vt rss_bucket_type_t
enum is defined as:
.Bd -literal
typedef enum {
        RSS_BUCKET_TYPE_NONE = 0,
        RSS_BUCKET_TYPE_KERNEL_ALL = 1,
        RSS_BUCKET_TYPE_KERNEL_TX = 2,
        RSS_BUCKET_TYPE_KERNEL_RX = 3,
        RSS_BUCKET_TYPE_MAX = 3,
} rss_bucket_type_t;
.Ed
.Pp
The rebalance callback
.Vt rss_bucket_rebalance_cb_t
is defined as:
.Bd -literal
typedef void rss_bucket_rebalance_cb_t(void *arg);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn rss_set_bucket_rebalance_cb
function sets an optional callback that will be called if the kernel
rebalances RSS buckets.
This is intended as a future expansion to rebalance buckets rather than
reprogram the RSS key, so typically the only work to be performed
is to rebind worker threads to an updated cpuset.
.Pp
Once RSS setup is completed,
.Fn rss_config_free
is called to free the RSS configuration structure.
.Pp
To make a
.Vt bind
socket RSS aware, the
.Fn rss_sock_set_bindmulti
function is used to enable or disable per-RSS bucket
behaviour.
The socket filedescriptor, address family and enable flag
.Vt val
are passed in.
.Pp
If
.Vt val
is set to 1, the socket can be placed in an RSS bucket and will only accept
datagrams (for UDP) or connections (for TCP) that are received for that
RSS bucket.
If set to 0, the socket is placed in the default PCB and will see
datagrams/connections that are not initially consumed by a PCB aware
socket.
.Pp
The
.Fn rss_sock_set_rss_bucket
function configures the RSS bucket which a socket belongs in.
Note that TCP sockets created by
.Xr accept 2
will automatically be assigned to the RSS bucket.
.Pp
The
.Fn rss_sock_set_recvrss
function enables or disables receiving RSS related information
as socket options in.
.2 recvmsg
calls.
.Pp
When enabled, UDP datagrams will have a message with the
.Vt IP_RECVFLOWID
option indicating the 32-bit receive flowid as a uint32_t,
and the
.Vt IP_RECVRSSBUCKETID
option indicating the 32 bit RSS bucket id as a uint32_t.
.Sh ERRORS
The functions return either <0 or NULL as appropriate upon error.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Xr librss.3
library first appeared in
.Fx 11.0 .

.Sh BUGS
There is currently no kernel mechanism to rebalance the RSS bucket to CPU
mapping, and so the callback mechanism is a no-op.
