.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

utility is used for setting up a device which contains a shared secret.
The secret is shared between the given providers.
To collect the secret, all providers are needed.
If one of the components is missing, there is no way to get any useful data from
the rest of them.
The first argument to
.Nm
indicates an action to be performed:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm destroy"
.It Cm label
Set up a shared secret device from the given components with the specified
.Ar name .
Metadata are stored in the last sector of every component.
.It Cm stop
Turn off an existing shared secret device by its
.Ar name .
This command does not touch on-disk metadata!
.It Cm clear

.It Cm dump

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example shows how to create a shared secret device.

.Bd -literal -offset indent
gshsec label -v secret /dev/ada0s1 /dev/da0
newfs /dev/shsec/secret

device.
