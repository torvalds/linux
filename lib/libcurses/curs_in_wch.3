.SH NAME
\fBin_wch\fP,
\fBmvin_wch\fP,
\fBmvwin_wch\fP,
\fBwin_wch\fP \- extract a complex character and rendition from a window
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint in_wch(cchar_t *\fIwcval\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint win_wch(WINDOW *\fIwin\fB, cchar_t *\fIwcval\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint mvin_wch(int \fIy\fB, int \fIx\fB, cchar_t *\fIwcval\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint mvwin_wch(WINDOW *\fIwin\fB, int \fIy\fB, int \fIx\fB, cchar_t *\fIwcval\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions extract the complex character and rendition from
the current position in the named window into the \fBcchar_t\fP object
referenced by wcval.
.SH RETURN VALUE
No errors are defined in the XSI Curses standard.
This implementation checks for null pointers, returns \fBERR\fP in that case.
Also, the \fImv\fP routines check for error moving the cursor,
returning \fBERR\fP in that case.
Otherwise they return \fBOK\fP.
.PP
Functions with a \*(``mv\*('' prefix first perform a cursor movement using
\fBwmove\fP, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
or if the window pointer is null.
.SH NOTES
Note that all of these routines may be macros.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3),
\fBcurs_inch\fP(3).
