# This script takes terminfo.head and terminfo.tail and splices in between
# them a table derived from the Caps data file.  Besides avoiding having
# the docs fall out of sync with the table, this also lets us set up tbl
# commands for better formatting of the table.
#
# NOTE: The s in this script really are control characters.  It translates
#  to \n because I couldn't get used to inserting linefeeds directly.  There
# had better be no s in the table source text.
#
# keep the order independent of locale:

if test "${LC_ALL+set}"      = set; then LC_ALL=C;      export LC_ALL;      fi
if test "${LC_MESSAGES+set}" = set; then LC_MESSAGES=C; export LC_MESSAGES; fi
