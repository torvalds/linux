.SH NAME
\fBcurses_version\fP,
\fBuse_extended_names\fP \- miscellaneous curses extensions
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP
.sp
\fBconst char * curses_version(void);\fP
.br
\fBint use_extended_names(bool \fIenable\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are extensions to the curses library
which do not fit easily into other categories.
.SS curses_version
Use \fBcurses_version\fP
to get the version number, including patch level of the library,
prefixed by \*(``ncurses\*('', e.g.,
.RS
.sp
.B ncurses 5.0.19991023
.RE
.SS use_extended_names
The \fBuse_extended_names\fP
function controls whether the calling application
is able to use user-defined or nonstandard names
which may be compiled into the terminfo
description, i.e., via the terminfo or termcap interfaces.
Normally these names are available for use, since the essential decision
is made by using the \fB\-x\fP option of \fBtic\fP to compile
extended terminal definitions.
However you can disable this feature
to ensure compatibility with other implementations of curses.
.SH RETURN VALUE
\fBcurses_version\fP returns a pointer to static memory; you should not free
this in your application.
.PP
\fBuse_extended_names\fP returns the previous state, allowing you to
save this and restore it.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines are specific to ncurses.
They were not supported on
Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.
It is recommended that
any code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
