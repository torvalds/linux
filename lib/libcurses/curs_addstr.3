.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions write the (null-terminated) character string
\fIstr\fP on the given window.
It is similar to calling \fBwaddch\fP once for each byte in the string.
.PP
The \fImv\fP functions perform cursor movement once, before writing any
characters.
Thereafter, the cursor is advanced as a side-effect of writing to the window.
.PP
The four functions with \fIn\fP as the last argument
write at most \fIn\fP bytes,
or until a terminating null is reached.
If \fIn\fP is \-1, then the entire string will be added.
.SH RETURN VALUE
All functions return the integer \fBERR\fP upon failure and \fBOK\fP on success.
.PP
X/Open does not define any error conditions.
This implementation returns an error
.bP
if the window pointer is null or
.bP
if the string pointer is null or
.bP
if the corresponding calls to \fBwaddch\fP return an error.
.PP
Functions with a \*(``mv\*('' prefix first perform a cursor movement using
\fBwmove\fP, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
or if the window pointer is null.
If an error is returned by the \fBwmove\fP,
no characters are added to the window.
.PP
If an error is returned by \fBwaddch\fP
(e.g.,
because the window is not large enough,
or an illegal byte sequence was detected)
only part of the string may be added.
Aside from that,
there is a special case in \fBwaddch\fP where an error may be
returned after successfully writing a character to the lower-right corner
of a window when \fBscrollok\fP(3) is disabled.
.SH NOTES
All of these functions except \fBwaddnstr\fP may be macros.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3),
\fBcurs_addch\fP(3).
