.TH wresize 3 2023-07-01 "ncurses 6.4" "Library calls"
.SH NAME
\fBwresize\fP \- resize a curses window
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint wresize(WINDOW *\fIwin\fB, int \fIlines\fB, int \fIcolumns\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an extension to the curses library.
It reallocates storage for an \fBncurses\fP
window to adjust its dimensions to the specified values.
If either dimension is larger than the current values, the
window's data is filled with blanks that have the current background rendition
(as set by \fBwbkgdset\fP) merged into them.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function returns the integer \fBERR\fP upon failure and \fBOK\fP on success.
It will fail if either of the dimensions less than or equal to zero,
or if an error occurs while (re)allocating memory for the window.
.SH NOTES
The only restriction placed on the dimensions is that they be greater than zero.
The dimensions are not compared to \fBcurses\fP screen dimensions to
simplify the logic of \fBresizeterm\fP.
The caller must ensure that the window's dimensions fit within the
actual screen dimensions.
.SH PORTABILITY
It is not possible to resize windows with SVr4 curses.
.PP
This extension of ncurses was introduced in mid-1995.
It was adopted in NetBSD curses (2001) and PDCurses (2003).
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBresizeterm\fP(3).
.SH AUTHOR
Thomas Dickey (from an equivalent function written in 1988 for BSD curses).
