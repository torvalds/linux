.SH NAME
\fBmove\fP,
\fBwmove\fP \- move \fBcurses\fP window cursor
.ad
.hy
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint move(int \fIy\fB, int \fIx\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint wmove(WINDOW *\fIwin\fB, int \fIy\fB, int \fIx\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines move the cursor associated with the window to line \fIy\fP and
column \fIx\fP.
This routine does not move the physical cursor of the terminal
until \fBrefresh\fP(3) is called.
The position specified is relative to the upper
left-hand corner of the window, which is (0,0).
.SH RETURN VALUE
These routines return \fBERR\fP upon failure and \fBOK\fP (SVr4
specifies only "an integer value other than \fBERR\fP") upon successful
completion.
.PP
Specifically, they return an error
if the window pointer is null, or
if the position is outside the window.
.SH NOTES
Note that \fBmove\fP may be a macro.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3), \fBcurs_refresh\fP(3)
