.TH curs_deleteln 3 2023-07-01 "ncurses 6.4" "Library calls"
.SH NAME
\fBdeleteln\fP,
\fBwdeleteln\fP,
\fBinsdelln\fP,
\fBwinsdelln\fP,
\fBinsertln\fP,
\fBwinsertln\fP \- delete and insert lines in a \fBcurses\fP window
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint deleteln(void);\fP
.br
\fBint wdeleteln(WINDOW *\fIwin\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint insdelln(int \fIn\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint winsdelln(WINDOW *\fIwin\fB, int \fIn\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint insertln(void);\fP
.br
\fBint winsertln(WINDOW *\fIwin\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBdeleteln\fP and \fBwdeleteln\fP routines delete the line under the
cursor in the window; all lines below the current line are moved up one line.
The bottom line of the window is cleared.
The cursor position does not change.
.PP
The \fBinsdelln\fP and \fBwinsdelln\fP routines, for positive \fIn\fP, insert
\fIn\fP lines into the specified window above the current line.
The \fIn\fP
bottom lines are lost.
For negative \fIn\fP, delete \fIn\fP lines (starting
with the one under the cursor), and move the remaining lines up.
The bottom
\fIn\fP lines are cleared.
The current cursor position remains the same.
.PP
The \fBinsertln\fP and \fBwinsertln\fP routines insert a blank line above the
current line and the bottom line is lost.
.SH RETURN VALUE
All routines return the integer \fBERR\fP upon failure and an \fBOK\fP (SVr4
specifies only "an integer value other than \fBERR\fP") upon successful
completion.
.PP
X/Open defines no error conditions.
In this implementation,
if the window parameter is null, an error is returned.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
The
standard specifies that they return \fBERR\fP on failure, but specifies no
error conditions.
.SH NOTES
Note that all but \fBwinsdelln\fP may be macros.
.PP
These routines do not require a hardware line delete or insert feature in the
terminal.
In fact, they will not use hardware line delete/insert unless
\fBidlok(..., TRUE)\fP has been set on the current window.
