.TH keyok 3 2022-02-12 "ncurses 6.4" "Library calls"
.SH NAME
\fBkeyok\fP \- enable or disable a keycode
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint keyok(int \fIkeycode\fB, bool \fIenable\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an extension to the curses library.
It permits an application to disable specific keycodes, rather than
use the \fBkeypad\fP function to disable all keycodes.
Keys that have been disabled can be re-enabled.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The keycode must be greater than zero, else \fBERR\fP is returned.
If it does not correspond to a defined key, then \fBERR\fP is returned.
If the \fIenable\fP parameter is true, then the key must have been disabled,
and vice versa.
Otherwise, the function returns \fBOK\fP.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines are specific to ncurses.
They were not supported on
Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.
It is recommended that
any code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBdefine_key\fP(3).
