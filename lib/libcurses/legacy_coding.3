.TH legacy_coding 3 2022-02-12 "ncurses 6.4" "Library calls"
.SH NAME
\fBuse_legacy_coding\fP \- override locale-encoding checks
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint use_legacy_coding(int \fIlevel\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBuse_legacy_coding\fP function is an extension to the curses library.
It allows the caller to change the result of \fBunctrl\fP,
and suppress related checks within the library that would normally
cause nonprinting characters to be rendered in visible form.
This affects only 8-bit characters.
.PP
The \fIlevel\fP parameter controls the result:
.RS
.TP 5
0
the library functions normally,
rendering nonprinting characters as described in \fBunctrl\fP.
.TP
1
the library ignores \fBisprintf\fP for codes in the range 160-255.
.TP
2
the library ignores \fBisprintf\fP for codes in the range 128-255.
It also modifies the output of \fBunctrl\fP, showing codes in the
range 128-159 as is.
.RE
.SH RETURN VALUE
If the screen has not been initialized,
or the \fIlevel\fP parameter is out of range,
the function returns \fBERR\fP.
Otherwise, it returns the previous level: \fB0\fP, \fB1\fP or \fB2\fP.
.SH PORTABILITY
This routine is specific to ncurses.
It was not supported on Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.
It is recommended that any code depending on ncurses extensions
be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBunctrl\fP(3).
.SH AUTHOR
Thomas Dickey (to support lynx's font-switching feature).
