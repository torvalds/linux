.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS add_wch
The
\fBadd_wch\fP,
\fBwadd_wch\fP,
\fBmvadd_wch\fP, and
\fBmvwadd_wch\fP
functions put the complex character \fIwch\fP into the given
window at its current position,
which is then advanced.
These functions perform
wrapping and special-character processing as follows:
.bP
If \fIwch\fP refers to a spacing character,
then any previous character at that location is removed.
A new character specified by \fIwch\fP is
placed at that location with rendition specified by \fIwch\fP.
The cursor then advances after this spacing character,
to prepare for writing the next character on the screen.
.IP
The newly added spacing character is the base of the active complex character.
Subsequent non-spacing characters can be combined with this base
until another spacing character is written to the screen,
or the cursor is moved, e.g., using \fBwmove\fP.
.bP
If \fIwch\fP refers to a non-spacing character,
it is appended to the active complex character,
retaining the previous characters at that location.
The rendition specified by \fIwch\fP is ignored.
.IP
The cursor is not advanced after adding a non-spacing character.
Subsequent calls to add non-spacing characters will update the same position.
.bP
If the character part of \fIwch\fP is
a tab, newline, backspace or other control character,
the window is updated and the cursor moves as if \fBaddch\fP were called.
.SS echo_wchar
The \fBecho_wchar\fP
function is functionally equivalent to a call to
\fBadd_wch\fP
followed by a call to
\fBrefresh\fP(3).
Similarly, the
\fBwecho_wchar\fP
is functionally equivalent to a call to
\fBwadd_wch\fP
followed by a call to
\fBwrefresh\fP.
The knowledge
that only a single character is being output is taken into consideration and,
for non-control characters, a considerable performance gain might be seen
by using the *\fBecho\fP* functions instead of their equivalents.
.SS Line Graphics
Like \fBaddch\fP(3),
\fBaddch_wch\fP accepts symbols which make it simple to draw lines and other
frequently used special characters.
These symbols correspond to the same VT100 line-drawing set as
\fBaddch\fP(3).

Unicode's descriptions for these characters differs slightly from ncurses,
by introducing the term \*(``light\*('' (along with less important details).
Here are its descriptions for the normal, thick, and double horizontal lines:
.bP
U+2500 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT HORIZONTAL
.bP
U+2501 BOX DRAWINGS HEAVY HORIZONTAL
.bP
U+2550 BOX DRAWINGS DOUBLE HORIZONTAL
.SH RETURN VALUE
All routines return the integer \fBERR\fP upon failure and \fBOK\fP on success.
.PP
X/Open does not define any error conditions.
This implementation returns an error
.bP
if the window pointer is null or
.bP
if it is not possible to add a complete character in the window.
.PP
The latter may be due to different causes:
.bP
If \fBscrollok\fP(3) is not enabled,
writing a character at the lower right margin succeeds.
However, an error is returned because
it is not possible to wrap to a new line
.bP
If an error is detected when converting a multibyte character to a sequence
of bytes,
or if it is not possible to add all of the resulting bytes in the window,
an error is returned.
.PP
Functions with a \*(``mv\*('' prefix first perform a cursor movement using
\fBwmove\fP, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
or if the window pointer is null.
.SH NOTES
Note that
\fBadd_wch\fP,
\fBmvadd_wch\fP,
\fBmvwadd_wch\fP, and
\fBecho_wchar\fP
may be macros.
.SH PORTABILITY
All of these functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
The defaults specified for line-drawing characters apply in the POSIX locale.
.SS WACS Symbols
X/Open Curses makes it clear that the WACS_ symbols should be defined as
a pointer to \fBcchar_t\fP data, e.g., in the discussion of \fBborder_set\fP.
A few implementations are problematic:
.bP
NetBSD curses defines the symbols as a \fBwchar_t\fP within a \fBcchar_t\fP.
.bP
HPUX curses equates some of the \fBACS_\fP symbols
to the analogous \fBWACS_\fP symbols as if the \fBACS_\fP symbols were
wide characters.
The misdefined symbols are the arrows
and other symbols which are not used for line-drawing.
.PP
X/Open Curses does not define symbols for thick- or double-lines.
SVr4 curses implementations defined their line-drawing symbols in
terms of intermediate symbols.
This implementation extends those symbols, providing new definitions
which are not in the SVr4 implementations.
.PP
Not all Unicode-capable terminals provide support for VT100-style
alternate character sets (i.e., the \fBacsc\fP capability),
with their corresponding line-drawing characters.
X/Open Curses did not address the aspect of integrating Unicode with
line-drawing characters.
Existing implementations of Unix curses (AIX, HPUX, Solaris)
use only the \fBacsc\fP character-mapping to provide this feature.
As a result, those implementations can only use single-byte line-drawing
characters.
Ncurses 5.3 (2002) provided a table of Unicode values to solve these problems.
NetBSD curses incorporated that table in 2010.
.PP
In this implementation, the Unicode values are used instead of the
terminal description's \fBacsc\fP mapping as discussed in ncurses(3)
for the environment variable \fBNCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS\fP.
In contrast, for the same cases, the line-drawing characters
described in \fBcurs_addch\fP(3) will use only the ASCII default values.
.PP
Having Unicode available does not solve all of the problems with
line-drawing for curses:
.bP
The closest Unicode equivalents to the
VT100 graphics \fIS1\fP, \fIS3\fP, \fIS7\fP and \fIS9\fP
frequently are not displayed at
the regular intervals which the terminal used.
.bP
The \fIlantern\fP is a special case.
It originated with the AT&T 4410 terminal in the early 1980s.
There is no accessible documentation depicting the lantern symbol
on the AT&T terminal.
.IP
Lacking documentation, most readers assume that a \fIstorm lantern\fP
was intended.
But there are several possibilities, all with problems.
.IP
Unicode 6.0 (2010) does provide two lantern symbols: U+1F383 and U+1F3EE.
Those were not available in 2002, and are irrelevant since
they lie outside the BMP and as a result are not generally available
in terminals.
They are not storm lanterns, in any case.
.IP
Most \fIstorm lanterns\fP have a tapering glass chimney
(to guard against tipping);
some have a wire grid protecting the chimney.
.IP
For the tapering appearance, \[u2603] U+2603 was adequate.
In use on a terminal, no one can tell what the image represents.
Unicode calls it a snowman.
.IP
Others have suggested these alternatives:
\[sc] U+00A7 (section mark),
\[u0398] U+0398 (theta),
\[u03A6] U+03A6 (phi),
\[u03B4] U+03B4 (delta),
\[u2327] U+2327 (x in a rectangle),
\[u256C] U+256C (forms double vertical and horizontal), and
\[u2612] U+2612 (ballot box with x).
.SS Complex Characters
The complex character type \fBcchar_t\fR
can store more than one wide character (\fBwchar_t\fR).
The X/Open Curses description does not mention this possibility,
describing only the cases where \fIwch\fP is a spacing character
or a non-spacing character.
.PP
This implementation assumes that \fIwch\fP is constructed using
\fBsetcchar\fP(3), and in turn that the result
.bP
contains at most one spacing character in the beginning of its list of wide
characters,
and zero or more non-spacing characters
or
.bP
may hold one non-spacing character.
.PP
In the latter case, ncurses adds the non-spacing character to the active
(base) spacing character.
