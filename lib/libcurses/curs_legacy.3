.SH NAME
curs_legacy \- get \fBcurses\fP cursor and window coordinates, attributes
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint getattrs(const WINDOW *\fIwin\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint getbegx(const WINDOW *\fIwin\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint getbegy(const WINDOW *\fIwin\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint getcurx(const WINDOW *\fIwin\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint getcury(const WINDOW *\fIwin\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint getmaxx(const WINDOW *\fIwin\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint getmaxy(const WINDOW *\fIwin\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint getparx(const WINDOW *\fIwin\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint getpary(const WINDOW *\fIwin\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
These legacy functions are simpler to use than the X/Open Curses functions:
.bP
The \fBgetattrs\fP function returns the same attribute data as \fBwattr_get\fP.
.IP
However, \fBgetattrs\fP returns an integer (actually a \fBchtype\fP),
while \fBwattr_get\fP returns the current color pair in a separate parameter.
In the wide-character library configuration,
color pairs may not fit into a \fBchtype\fP,
so \fBwattr_get\fP is the only way to obtain the color information.
.IP
Because \fBgetattrs\fP returns the attributes in a single parameter,
it would not be possible for an application to distinguish that from
\fBERR\fP (a \fI-1\fP).
If the window parameter is null, \fBgetattrs\fP returns \fBA_NORMAL\fP (zero).
.bP
The \fBgetbegy\fP and \fBgetbegx\fP functions return the same
data as \fBgetbegyx\fP.
.bP
The \fBgetcury\fP and \fBgetcurx\fP functions return the same
data as \fBgetyx\fP.
.bP
The \fBgetmaxy\fP and \fBgetmaxx\fP functions return the same
data as \fBgetmaxyx\fP.
.bP
The \fBgetpary\fP and \fBgetparx\fP functions return the same
data as \fBgetparyx\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Except as noted,
these functions return an integer,
or \fBERR\fP if the window parameter is null.
.SH NOTES
All of these interfaces are provided as macros and functions.
The macros are suppressed (and only the functions provided)
when \fBNCURSES_OPAQUE\fP is defined.
The standard forms such as \fBgetyx\fP must be implemented as macros,
and (in this implementation) are defined in terms of the functions
described here,
to avoid reliance on internal details of the WINDOW structure.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions were supported on Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.
None of those implementations checked the window parameter.
.PP
The \fBgetattrs\fP function and macro are defined to return a (signed) integer
for compatibility with those implementations
although an unsigned type would have been more appropriate.
