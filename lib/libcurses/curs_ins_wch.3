.SH NAME
\fBins_wch\fP,
\fBmvins_wch\fP,
\fBmvwins_wch\fP,
\fBwins_wch\fP \- insert a complex character and rendition into a window
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curses.h>
.sp
\fBint ins_wch(const cchar_t *\fIwch\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint wins_wch(WINDOW *\fIwin\fB, const cchar_t *\fIwch\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint mvins_wch(int \fIy\fB, int \fIx\fB, const cchar_t *\fIwch\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint mvwins_wch(WINDOW *\fIwin\fB, int \fIy\fB, int \fIx\fB, const cchar_t *\fIwch\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines, insert the complex character \fIwch\fP with rendition
before the character under the cursor.
All characters to the right of the cursor are moved one space to the right,
with the possibility of the rightmost character on the line being lost.
The insertion operation does not change the cursor position.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If successful, these functions return \fBOK\fP.
If not, they return \fBERR\fP.
.PP
Functions with a \*(``mv\*('' prefix first perform a cursor movement using
\fBwmove\fP, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
or if the window pointer is null.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3),
\fBcurs_insch\fP(3).
