.TH define_key 3 2022-02-12 "ncurses 6.4" "Library calls"
.SH NAME
\fBdefine_key\fP \- define a keycode
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint define_key(const char *\fIdefinition\fB, int \fIkeycode\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an extension to the curses library.
It permits an application to define keycodes with their corresponding control
strings, so that the ncurses library will interpret them just as it would
the predefined codes in the terminfo database.
.PP
If the given string is null, any existing definition for the keycode is
removed.
Similarly, if the given keycode is negative or zero, any existing string
for the given definition is removed.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The keycode must be greater than zero, and the string non-null,
otherwise \fBERR\fP is returned.
\fBERR\fP may also be returned if there is insufficient memory to allocate the
data to store the definition.
If no error is detected, \fBOK\fP is returned.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines are specific to ncurses.
They were not supported on
Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.
It is recommended that
any code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBkeyok\fP(3),
\fBkey_defined\fP(3).
