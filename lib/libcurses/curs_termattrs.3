.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS baudrate
The \fBbaudrate\fP routine returns the output speed of the terminal.
The
number returned is in bits per second, for example \fB9600\fP, and is an
integer.
.SS erasechar, erasewchar
The \fBerasechar\fP routine returns the user's current erase character.
.PP
The \fBerasewchar\fP routine stores the current erase character
in the location referenced by \fIch\fP.
If no erase character has been defined, the routine fails
and the location referenced by \fIch\fP is not changed.
.SS has_is, has_il
The \fBhas_ic\fP routine is true if the terminal has insert- and delete-
character capabilities.
.PP
The \fBhas_il\fP routine is true if the terminal has insert- and delete-line
capabilities, or can simulate them using scrolling regions.
This might
be used to determine if it would be appropriate to turn on physical
scrolling using \fBscrollok\fP(3).
.SS killchar, killwchar
The \fBkillchar\fP routine returns the user's current line kill character.
.PP
The \fBkillwchar\fP routine stores the current line-kill character
in the location referenced by \fIch\fP.
If no line-kill character has been defined,
the routine fails and the location referenced by \fIch\fP is not changed.
.SS longname
The \fBlongname\fP routine returns a pointer to a static area
containing a verbose description of the current terminal.
The maximum
length of a verbose description is 128 characters.
It is defined only
after the call to \fBinitscr\fP or \fBnewterm\fP.  The area is
overwritten by each call to \fBnewterm\fP and is not restored by
\fBset_term\fP, so the value should be saved between calls to
\fBnewterm\fP if \fBlongname\fP is going to be used with multiple
terminals.
.SS termattrs, term_attrs
If a given terminal does not support a video attribute that an
application program is trying to use, \fBcurses\fP may substitute a
different video attribute for it.
The \fBtermattrs\fP and \fBterm_attrs\fP functions
return a logical \fBOR\fP of all video attributes supported by the
terminal using \fBA_\fP and \fBWA_\fP constants respectively.
This information is useful when a \fBcurses\fP program
needs complete control over the appearance of the screen.
.SS termname
The \fBtermname\fP routine returns the terminal name used by \fBsetupterm\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
\fBlongname\fP and \fBtermname\fP return \fBNULL\fP on error.
.PP
Routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fP upon failure and \fBOK\fP
(SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than \fBERR\fP") upon successful
completion.
.SH NOTES
Note that \fBtermattrs\fP may be a macro.
.SH PORTABILITY
The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.
It changes the
return type of \fBtermattrs\fP to the new type \fBattr_t\fP.
Most versions of curses truncate the result returned by \fBtermname\fP to
14 characters.
