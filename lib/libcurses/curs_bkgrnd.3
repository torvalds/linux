.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS bkgrndset
The \fBbkgrndset\fP and \fBwbkgrndset\fP routines manipulate the
background of the named window.
The window background is a \fBcchar_t\fP consisting of
any combination of attributes (i.e., rendition) and a complex character.
.bP
The attribute part of the background is combined (OR'ed) with all non-blank
characters that are written into the window with \fBwaddch\fP.
.bP
Both
the character and attribute parts of the background are combined with
the blank characters.
.PP
The background becomes a property of the
character and moves with the character through any scrolling and
insert/delete line/character operations.
.PP
To the extent possible on a
particular terminal, the attribute part of the background is displayed
as the graphic rendition of the character put on the screen.
.SS bkgrnd
The \fBbkgrnd\fP and \fBwbkgrnd\fP functions
set the background property of the current or specified window
and then apply this setting to every character position in that window:
.bP
The rendition of every character on the screen is changed to
the new background rendition.
.bP
Wherever the former background character
appears, it is changed to the new background character.
.SS getbkgrnd
The \fBgetbkgrnd\fP function returns the given window's current background
character/attribute pair via the \fBwch\fP pointer.
If the given window pointer is null,
the character is not updated (but no error returned).
.SH NOTES
Note that
\fBbkgrnd\fP,
\fBbkgrndset\fP, and
\fBgetbkgrnd\fP
may be macros.
.PP
X/Open Curses does not provide details on how the rendition is changed.
This implementation follows the approach used in SVr4 curses,
which is explained in the manual page for \fBwbkgd\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The \fBbkgrndset\fP and \fBwbkgrndset\fP routines do not return a value.
.PP
Upon successful completion, the other functions return \fBOK\fP.
Otherwise, they return \fBERR\fP:
.bP
A null window pointer is treated as an error.
.bP
A null character pointer is treated as an error.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4
(X/Open Curses).
