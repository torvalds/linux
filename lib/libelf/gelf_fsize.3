.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions return the size in bytes of the file representation of
.Ar count
numbers of objects of ELF type
.Ar type .
For ELF types that are of variable length, these functions return a
size of one byte.
.Pp
Functions
.Fn elf32_fsize
and
.Fn elf64_fsize
return sizes for files of class
.Dv ELFCLASS32
and
.Dv ELFCLASS64
respectively.
Function
.Fn gelf_fsize
returns the size for the class of ELF descriptor
.Ar elf .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return a non-zero value in case of success, or zero in
case of an error.
.Sh ERRORS
These functions may fail with:
.Bl -tag -width "[ELF_E_RESOURCE]"
.It Bq Er ELF_E_ARGUMENT
Argument
