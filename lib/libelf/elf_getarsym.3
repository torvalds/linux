.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm elf_getarsym
.Nd retrieve the symbol table of an archive
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libelf
.In libelf.h
.Ft "Elf_Arsym *"
.Fn elf_getarsym "Elf *elf" "size_t *ptr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn elf_getarsym
retrieves the symbol table for an
.Xr ar 1
archive, if one is available.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar elf
should be a descriptor for an
.Xr ar 1
archive opened using
.Fn elf_begin
or
.Fn elf_memory .
.Pp
If the archive
.Ar elf
contains a symbol table with n entries, this function returns a
pointer to an array of n+1
.Vt Elf_Arsym
structures.
An
.Vt Elf_Arsym
structure has the following elements:
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Vt "char *" Va as_name
This structure member is a pointer to a null-terminated symbol name.
.It Vt "off_t" Va as_off
This structure member contains the byte offset from the beginning of the archive to
the header for the archive member.
This value is suitable for use with
.Xr elf_rand 3 .
.It Vt "unsigned long" Va as_hash
This structure member contains a portable hash value for the symbol
name, as computed by
.Xr elf_hash 3 .
.El
.Pp
The last entry of the returned array will have a NULL value for member
.Va as_name ,
a zero value for member
.Va as_off
and an illegal value of ~0UL for
.Va as_hash .
.Pp
If argument
.Ar ptr
is non-null, the
.Fn elf_getarsym
function will store the number of table entries returned (including the
sentinel entry at the end) into the location it points to.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Function
.Fn elf_getarsym
returns a pointer to an array of
.Vt Elf_Arsym
structures if successful, or a NULL
pointer if an error was encountered.
.Pp
If argument
.Ar ptr
is non-null and there was no error, the library will store the
number of archive symbol entries returned into the location it
points to.
If argument
.Ar ptr
is non-null and an error was encountered, the library will
set the location pointed to by it to zero.
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn elf_getarsym
may fail with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width "[ELF_E_RESOURCE]"
.It Bq Er ELF_E_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Ar elf
was NULL.
.It Bq Er ELF_E_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Ar elf
was not a descriptor for an
.Xr ar 1
archive.
