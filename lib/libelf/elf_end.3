.Ft int
.Fn elf_end "Elf *elf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn elf_end
is used to release the resources associated with an ELF descriptor
pointed to by argument
.Ar elf .

.Ar elf .

.Fn elf_end
decrements the activation count for descriptor
.Ar elf
by one.
The resources associated with the descriptor are only released
with its activation count goes to zero.

returns zero, the ELF descriptor
.Ar elf
will no longer be valid and should not be used further.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
