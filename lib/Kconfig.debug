config PRINTK_TIME
	bool "Show timing information on printks"
	depends on PRINTK
	help
	  Selecting this option causes time stamps of the printk()
	  messages to be added to the output of the syslog() system
	  call and at the console.

	  The timestamp is always recorded internally, and exported
	  to /dev/kmsg. This flag just specifies if the timestamp should
	  be included, not that the timestamp is recorded.

	  The behavior is also controlled by the kernel command line
	  parameter printk.time=1. See Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.rst

config PRINTK_CALLER
	bool "Show caller information on printks"
	depends on PRINTK
	help
	  Selecting this option causes printk() to add a caller "thread id" (if
	  in task context) or a caller "processor id" (if not in task context)
	  to every message.

	  This option is intended for environments where multiple threads
	  concurrently call printk() for many times, for it is difficult to
	  interpret without knowing where these lines (or sometimes individual
	  line which was divided into multiple lines due to race) came from.

	  Since toggling after boot makes the code racy, currently there is
	  no option to enable/disable at the kernel command line parameter or
	  sysfs interface.

config STACKTRACE_BUILD_ID
	bool "Show build ID information in stacktraces"
	depends on PRINTK
	help
	  Selecting this option adds build ID information for symbols in
	  stacktraces printed with the printk format '%p[SR]b'.

	  This option is intended for distros where debuginfo is not easily
	  accessible but can be downloaded given the build ID of the vmlinux or
	  kernel module where the function is located.

config CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT
	int "Default console loglevel (1-15)"
	range 1 15
	default "7"
	help
	  Default loglevel to determine what will be printed on the console.

	  Setting a default here is equivalent to passing in loglevel=<x> in
	  the kernel bootargs. loglevel=<x> continues to override whatever
	  value is specified here as well.

	  Note: This does not affect the log level of un-prefixed printk()
	  usage in the kernel. That is controlled by the MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT
	  option.

config CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_QUIET
	int "quiet console loglevel (1-15)"
	range 1 15
	default "4"
	help
	  loglevel to use when "quiet" is passed on the kernel commandline.

	  When "quiet" is passed on the kernel commandline this loglevel
	  will be used as the loglevel. IOW passing "quiet" will be the
	  equivalent of passing "loglevel=<CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_QUIET>"

config MESSAGE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT
	int "Default message log level (1-7)"
	range 1 7
	default "4"
	help
	  Default log level for printk statements with no specified priority.

	  This was hard-coded to KERN_WARNING since at least 2.6.10 but folks
	  that are auditing their logs closely may want to set it to a lower
	  priority.

	  Note: This does not affect what message level gets printed on the console
	  by default. To change that, use loglevel=<x> in the kernel bootargs,
	  or pick a different CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT configuration value.

config BOOT_PRINTK_DELAY
	bool "Delay each boot printk message by N milliseconds"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && PRINTK && GENERIC_CALIBRATE_DELAY
	help
	  This build option allows you to read kernel boot messages
	  by inserting a short delay after each one.  The delay is
	  specified in milliseconds on the kernel command line,
	  using "boot_delay=N".

	  It is likely that you would also need to use "lpj=M" to preset
	  the "loops per jiffie" value.
	  See a previous boot log for the "lpj" value to use for your
	  system, and then set "lpj=M" before setting "boot_delay=N".
	  NOTE:  Using this option may adversely affect SMP systems.
	  I.e., processors other than the first one may not boot up.
	  BOOT_PRINTK_DELAY also may cause LOCKUP_DETECTOR to detect
	  what it believes to be lockup conditions.

config DYNAMIC_DEBUG
	bool "Enable dynamic printk() support"
	default n
	depends on PRINTK
	depends on (DEBUG_FS || PROC_FS)
	select DYNAMIC_DEBUG_CORE
	help

	  Compiles debug level messages into the kernel, which would not
	  otherwise be available at runtime. These messages can then be
	  enabled/disabled based on various levels of scope - per source file,
	  function, module, format string, and line number. This mechanism
	  implicitly compiles in all pr_debug() and dev_dbg() calls, which
	  enlarges the kernel text size by about 2%.

	  If a source file is compiled with DEBUG flag set, any
	  pr_debug() calls in it are enabled by default, but can be
	  disabled at runtime as below.  Note that DEBUG flag is
	  turned on by many CONFIG_*DEBUG* options.

	  Usage:

	  Dynamic debugging is controlled via the 'dynamic_debug/control' file,
	  which is contained in the 'debugfs' filesystem or procfs.
	  Thus, the debugfs or procfs filesystem must first be mounted before
	  making use of this feature.
	  We refer the control file as: <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control. This
	  file contains a list of the debug statements that can be enabled. The
	  format for each line of the file is:

		filename:lineno [module]function flags format

	  filename : source file of the debug statement
	  lineno : line number of the debug statement
	  module : module that contains the debug statement
	  function : function that contains the debug statement
	  flags : '=p' means the line is turned 'on' for printing
	  format : the format used for the debug statement

	  From a live system:

		nullarbor:~ # cat <debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control
		# filename:lineno [module]function flags format
		fs/aio.c:222 [aio]__put_ioctx =_ "__put_ioctx:\040freeing\040%p\012"
		fs/aio.c:248 [aio]ioctx_alloc =_ "ENOMEM:\040nr_events\040too\040high\012"
		fs/aio.c:1770 [aio]sys_io_cancel =_ "calling\040cancel\012"

	  Example usage:

		// enable the message at line 1603 of file svcsock.c
		nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'file svcsock.c line 1603 +p' >
						<debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control

		// enable all the messages in file svcsock.c
		nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'file svcsock.c +p' >
						<debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control

		// enable all the messages in the NFS server module
		nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'module nfsd +p' >
						<debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control

		// enable all 12 messages in the function svc_process()
		nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'func svc_process +p' >
						<debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control

		// disable all 12 messages in the function svc_process()
		nullarbor:~ # echo -n 'func svc_process -p' >
						<debugfs>/dynamic_debug/control

	  See Documentation/admin-guide/dynamic-debug-howto.rst for additional
	  information.

config DYNAMIC_DEBUG_CORE
	bool "Enable core function of dynamic debug support"
	depends on PRINTK
	depends on (DEBUG_FS || PROC_FS)
	help
	  Enable core functional support of dynamic debug. It is useful
	  when you want to tie dynamic debug to your kernel modules with
	  DYNAMIC_DEBUG_MODULE defined for each of them, especially for
	  the case of embedded system where the kernel image size is
	  sensitive for people.

config SYMBOLIC_ERRNAME
	bool "Support symbolic error names in printf"
	default y if PRINTK
	help
	  If you say Y here, the kernel's printf implementation will
	  be able to print symbolic error names such as ENOSPC instead
	  of the number 28. It makes the kernel image slightly larger
	  (about 3KB), but can make the kernel logs easier to read.

config DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE

	  The implicit default version of DWARF debug info produced by a

	  Users of dpkg-deb via scripts/package/builddeb may find an increase in
	  size of their debug .deb packages with this config set, due to the

	  In the code, functions and variables are annotated with

	  The panic can be used in combination with panic_timeout,
	  to cause the system to reboot automatically after a

	  Say Y here to enable the kernel to detect "hung tasks",

	  When a hung task is detected, the kernel will print the

	  It can be adjusted at runtime via the kernel.hung_task_timeout_secs
	  sysctl or by writing a value to

	 In short, this feature enables the kernel to report locking
	 related deadlocks before they actually occur.

	 The proof does not depend on how hard and complex a
	 deadlock scenario would be to trigger: how many
	 participant CPUs, tasks and irq-contexts would be needed
	 for it to trigger. The proof also does not depend on

	 is), it will be proven so and will immediately be
	 reported by the kernel (once the event is observed that
	 makes the deadlock theoretically possible).

	 If a deadlock is impossible (i.e. the locking rules, as
	 observed by the kernel, are mathematically correct), the
	 kernel reports nothing.

	 NOTE: this feature can also be enabled for rwlocks, mutexes

	  If you want to debug problems which hang or crash the kernel early

	  this feature to remotely access the memory of the crashed machine
	  over FireWire. This employs remote DMA as part of the OHCI1394
	  specification which is now the standard for FireWire controllers.

	  With remote DMA, you can monitor the printk buffer remotely using
	  firescope and access all memory below 4GB using fireproxy from gdb.
	  Even controlling a kernel debugger is possible using remote DMA.

	  Usage:

	  If ohci1394_dma=early is used as boot parameter, it will initialize
	  all OHCI1394 controllers which are found in the PCI config space.

	  As all changes to the FireWire bus such as enabling and disabling
	  devices cause a bus reset and thereby disable remote DMA for all
	  devices, be sure to have the cable plugged and FireWire enabled on
	  the debugging host before booting the debug target for debugging.

	  This code (~1k) is freed after boot. By then, the firewire stack
	  in charge of the OHCI-1394 controllers should be used instead.

config RUST_DEBUG_ASSERTIONS
	bool "Debug assertions"
	depends on RUST
	help
	  Enables rustc's `-Cdebug-assertions` codegen option.

	  This flag lets you turn `cfg(debug_assertions)` conditional
	  compilation on or off. This can be used to enable extra debugging
	  code in development but not in production. For example, it controls
	  the behavior of the standard library's `debug_assert!` macro.

	  Note that this will apply to all Rust code, including `core`.

	  If unsure, say N.

config RUST_OVERFLOW_CHECKS
	bool "Overflow checks"
	default y
	depends on RUST
	help
	  Enables rustc's `-Coverflow-checks` codegen option.

	  This flag allows you to control the behavior of runtime integer
	  overflow. When overflow-checks are enabled, a Rust panic will occur
	  on overflow.

	  Note that this will apply to all Rust code, including `core`.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config RUST_BUILD_ASSERT_ALLOW
	bool "Allow unoptimized build-time assertions"
	depends on RUST
	help
	  Controls how are `build_error!` and `build_assert!` handled during build.

	  If calls to them exist in the binary, it may indicate a violated invariant
	  or that the optimizer failed to verify the invariant during compilation.

	  This should not happen, thus by default the build is aborted. However,
	  as an escape hatch, you can choose Y here to ignore them during build
	  and let the check be carried at runtime (with `panic!` being called if
	  the check fails).

	  If unsure, say N.

config RUST_KERNEL_DOCTESTS
	bool "Doctests for the `kernel` crate" if !KUNIT_ALL_TESTS
	depends on RUST && KUNIT=y
	default KUNIT_ALL_TESTS
	help
	  This builds the documentation tests of the `kernel` crate
	  as KUnit tests.

	  For more information on KUnit and unit tests in general,
	  please refer to the KUnit documentation in Documentation/dev-tools/kunit/.

	  If unsure, say N.
