v0.4 Sat Jul 25 12:40:09 PDT 1998

- Fix endian problem with DLT_NULL devices. From FreeBSD via Bill
  Fenner (fenner@parc.xerox.com)

- Fix alignment problem with FDDI under DLPI. This was causing core
  dumps under Solaris.

- Added configure options to disable flex and bison. Resulted from a
  bug report by barnett@grymoire.crd.ge.com (Bruce Barnett). Also added
  options to disable gcc and to force a particular packet capture type.

- Added support for Fore ATM interfaces (qaa and fa) under IRIX. Thanks
  to John Hawkinson (jhawk@mit.edu)

- Change Linux PPP and SLIP to use DLT_RAW since the kernel does not
  supply any "link layer" data.

- Change Linux to use SIOCGIFHWADDR ioctl to determine link layer type.
  Thanks to Thomas Sailer (sailer@ife.ee.ethz.ch)

- Change IRIX PPP to use DLT_RAW since the kernel does not supply any
  "link layer" data.

- Modified to support the new BSD/OS 2.1 PPP and SLIP link layer header
  formats.

- Added some new SGI snoop interface types. Thanks to Steve Alexander
  (sca@refugee.engr.sgi.com)

- Fixes for HP-UX 10.20 (which is similar to HP-UX 9). Thanks to
  Richard Allen (ra@hp.is) and Steinar Haug (sthaug@nethelp.no)

- Fddi supports broadcast as reported by Jeff Macdonald
  (jeff@iacnet.com). Also correct ieee802 and arcnet.

- Determine Linux pcap buffer size at run time or else it might not be
  big enough for some interface types (e.g. FDDI). Thanks to Jes
  Sorensen (Jes.Sorensen@cern.ch)

- Fix some linux alignment problems.

- Document promisc argument to pcap_open_live(). Reported by Ian Marsh
  (ianm@sics.se)

- Support Metricom radio packets under Linux. Thanks to Kevin Lai
  (laik@gunpowder.stanford.edu)

- Bind to interface name under Linux to avoid packets from multiple
  interfaces on multi-homed hosts. Thanks to Kevin Lai
  (laik@gunpowder.stanford.edu)

- Change L_SET to SEEK_SET for HP-UX. Thanks to Roland Roberts
  (rroberts@muller.com)

- Fixed an uninitialized memory reference found by Kent Vander Velden
  (graphix@iastate.edu)

- Fixed lex pattern for IDs to allow leading digits. As reported by
  Theo de Raadt (deraadt@cvs.openbsd.org)

- Fixed Linux include file problems when using GNU libc.

- Ifdef ARPHRD_FDDI since not all versions of the Linux kernel have it.
  Reported reported by Eric Jacksch (jacksch@tenebris.ca)

- Fixed bug in pcap_dispatch() that kept it from returning on packet
  timeouts.

- Changed ISLOOPBACK() macro when IFF_LOOPBACK isn't available to check
  for "lo" followed by an eos or digit (newer versions of Linux
  apparently call the loopback "lo" instead of "lo0").

- Fixed Linux networking include files to use ints instead of longs to
  avoid problems with 64 bit longs on the alpha. Thanks to Cristian
  Gafton (gafton@redhat.com)

  (barnett@grymoire.crd.ge.com)

  justifing"

- Add "sca" keyword (for DEC cluster services) as suggested by Terry
  Kennedy (terry@spcvxa.spc.edu)

- Add "atalk" keyword as suggested by John Hawkinson.

  Alexander (sca@engr.sgi.com)

v0.1 Fri Apr 28 18:11:03 PDT 1995

- Fixed compiler and optimizer bugs.  The BPF filter engine uses unsigned
  comparison operators, while the code generator and optimizer assumed
  signed semantics in several places.  Thanks to Charlie Slater
  (cslater@imatek.com) for pointing this out.

  expiring.

v0.0.4 Thu Apr 20 20:41:48 PDT 1995

- Change configuration to not use gcc v2 flags with gcc v1.

  IRIX 5. Thanks to J. Eric Townsend (jet@abulafia.genmagic.com).

- Hack around deficiency in Ultrix's make.

  "fixincludes" script has been run.

v0.0.3 Tue Oct 18 18:13:46 PDT 1994

  by Mahesh Jethanandani (mahesh@npix.com).

v0.0.1 Fri Jun 24 14:50:57 PDT 1994

- Fixed bug in nit_setflags() in pcap-snit.c. The streams ioctl timeout
  wasn't being initialized sometimes resulting in an "NIOCSFLAGS:
  Invalid argument" error under OSF/1. Reported by Matt Day
  (mday@artisoft.com) and Danny Mitzel (dmitzel@whitney.hitc.com).

- Turn on FDDI support by default.
