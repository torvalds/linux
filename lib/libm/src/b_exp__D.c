/* EXP(X)
 * RETURN THE EXPONENTIAL OF X
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (IEEE 53 bits, VAX D FORMAT 56 BITS)
 * CODED IN C BY K.C. NG, 1/19/85;
 * REVISED BY K.C. NG on 2/6/85, 2/15/85, 3/7/85, 3/24/85, 4/16/85, 6/14/86.
 *
 * Required system supported functions:
 *	scalb(x,n)
 *	copysign(x,y)
 *	isfinite(x)
 *
 * Method:
 *	1. Argument Reduction: given the input x, find r and integer k such
 *	   that
 *	                   x = k*ln2 + r,  |r| <= 0.5*ln2 .
 *	   r will be represented as r := z+c for better accuracy.
 *
 *	2. Compute exp(r) by
 *
 *		exp(r) = 1 + r + r*R1/(2-R1),
 *	   where
 *		R1 = x - x^2*(p1+x^2*(p2+x^2*(p3+x^2*(p4+p5*x^2)))).
 *
 *	3. exp(x) = 2^k * exp(r) .
 *
 * Special cases:
 *	exp(INF) is INF, exp(NaN) is NaN;
 *	exp(-INF)=  0;
 *	for finite argument, only exp(0)=1 is exact.
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	exp(x) returns the exponential of x nearly rounded. In a test run
 *	with 1,156,000 random arguments on a VAX, the maximum observed
 *	error was 0.869 ulps (units in the last place).
