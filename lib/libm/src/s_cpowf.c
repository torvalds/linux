/*							cpowf
 *
 *	Complex power function
 *
 *
 *
 * SYNOPSIS:
 *
 * float complex cpowf();
 * float complex a, z, w;
 *
 * w = cpowf (a, z);
 *
 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * Raises complex A to the complex Zth power.
 * Definition is per AMS55 # 4.2.8,
 * analytically equivalent to cpow(a,z) = cexp(z clog(a)).
 *
 * ACCURACY:
 *
 *                      Relative error:
 * arithmetic   domain     # trials      peak         rms
 *    IEEE      -10,+10     30000       9.4e-15     1.5e-15
