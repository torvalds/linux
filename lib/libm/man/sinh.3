.Sh NAME
.Nm sinh ,
.Nm sinhf ,
.Nm sinhl
.Nd hyperbolic sine functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libm
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn sinh "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn sinhf "float x"
.Ft long double
.Fn sinhl "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sinh
function computes the hyperbolic sine of
.Fa x .
The
.Fn sinhf
function is a single precision version of
.Fn sinh .
The
.Fn sinhl
function is an extended precision version of
.Fn sinh .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn sinh ,
.Fn sinhf
and
.Fn sinhl
functions return the hyperbolic sine value unless
the magnitude
of
.Fa x
is too large; in this event, the global variable
.Va errno
is set to
.Er ERANGE .
