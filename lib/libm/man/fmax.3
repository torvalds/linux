.Sh NAME
.Nm fmax ,
.Nm fmaxf ,
.Nm fmaxl ,
.Nm fmin ,
.Nm fminf ,
.Nm fminl
.Nd floating-point maximum and minimum functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libm
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn fmax "double x" "double y"
.Ft float
.Fn fmaxf "float x" "float y"
.Ft long double
.Fn fmaxl "long double x" "long double y"
.Ft double
.Fn fmin "double x" "double y"
.Ft float
.Fn fminf "float x" "float y"
.Ft long double
.Fn fminl "long double x" "long double y"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fmax ,
.Fn fmaxf ,
and
.Fn fmaxl
functions return the larger of
.Fa x
and
.Fa y ,
and likewise the
.Fn fmin ,
.Fn fminf ,
and
.Fn fminl
functions return the smaller of
.Fa x
and
.Fa y .
They treat
.Li +0.0
as being larger than
.Li -0.0 .
If one argument is an NaN, then the other argument is returned.
If both arguments are NaNs, then the result is an NaN.
These routines do not raise any floating-point exceptions.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fabs 3 ,
.Xr fdim 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn fmax ,
.Fn fmaxf ,
.Fn fmaxl ,
.Fn fmin ,
.Fn fminf ,
and
.Fn fminl
functions conform to
.St -isoC-99 .
.Sh HISTORY
These routines first appeared in
.Ox 4.5 .
