.Sh NAME
.Nm cosh ,
.Nm coshf ,
.Nm coshl
.Nd hyperbolic cosine functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libm
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn cosh "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn coshf "float x"
.Ft long double
.Fn coshl "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cosh
function computes the hyperbolic cosine of

The
.Fn coshf
function is a single precision version of
.Fn cosh .
The
.Fn coshl
function is an extended precision version of
.Fn cosh .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the magnitude of x is too large,
.Fn cosh "x" ,
.Fn coshf "x"
and
.Fn coshl "x"
return infinity and set the global variable
.Va errno
to
.Er ERANGE .
