.Sh NAME
.Nm sin ,
.Nm sinf ,
.Nm sinl
.Nd sine functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libm
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn sin "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn sinf "float x"
.Ft long double
.Fn sinl "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn sin
function computes the sine of
.Fa x
(measured in radians).
The
.Fn sinf
function is a single precision version of
.Fn sin .
The
.Fn sinl
function is an extended precision version of
.Fn sin .
A large magnitude argument may yield a result with little or no
significance.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn sin ,
.Fn sinf
and
.Fn sinl
functions return the sine value.
