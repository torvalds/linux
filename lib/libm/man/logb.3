.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions allow users to test conformance to
.St -ieee754 .
Their use is not otherwise recommended.
.Pp
.Fn logb x
returns
.Fa x Ns 's exponent
.Fa n ,
a signed integer converted to double\-precision floating\-point.
.Fn logb \(+-infinity
= +infinity;
.Fn logb 0
= -infinity with a division by zero exception.
.Fn logbf
is the single precision form of
.Fn logb .
.Fn logbl
is the extended precision form of
.Fn logb .
.Pp
.Fn scalb x n
returns
.Fa x Ns *(2** Ns Fa n )
computed by exponent manipulation.
.Fn scalbf
is the single precision form of
.Fn scalb .
.Fn scalbl
is the extended precision form of
.Fn scalb .
.Pp
.Fn significand x
returns
.Fa sig ,
where
.Fa x
:=
.Fa sig No * 2** Ns Fa n
with 1 \(<=
.Fa sig
< 2.
.Fn significand x
is not defined when
.Fa x
is 0, \(+-infinity, or NaN.
.Fn significandf
is the single precision for of
.Fn significand .
