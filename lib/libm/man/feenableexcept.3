.Sh NAME
.Nm feenableexcept ,
.Nm fedisableexcept ,
.Nm fegetexcept
.Nd control floating-point exception masks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libm
.In fenv.h
.Ft int
.Fn feenableexcept "int excepts"
.Ft int
.Fn fedisableexcept "int excepts"
.Ft int
.Fn fegetexcept void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide control of the floating-point exception
masks.
The
.Fa excepts
input argument is a bitmask specifying an exception type and
containing any of the values listed in
.Xr feclearexcept 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn feenableexcept
function unmasks the floating-point exceptions represented by
.Fa excepts .
The future floating-point operations that produce
.Fa excepts
will trap, and a
.Dv SIGFPE
will be delivered to the process.
.Pp
The
.Fn fedisableexcept
function masks the floating-point exceptions represented by
.Fa excepts .
All exceptions are masked by default.
.Pp
The
.Fn fegetexcept
function returns the current exception mask.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn feenableexcept ,
and
.Fn fedisableexcept
functions return the previous exception mask.
The
.Fn fegetexcept
function returns the current exception mask.
