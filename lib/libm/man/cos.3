.Sh NAME
.Nm cos ,
.Nm cosf ,
.Nm cosl
.Nd cosine functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libm
.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn cos "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn cosf "float x"
.Ft long double
.Fn cosl "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn cos
function computes the cosine of
.Fa x
(measured in radians).
The
.Fn cosf
function is a single precision version of
.Fn cos .
The
.Fn cosl
function is an extended precision version of
.Fn cos .
A large magnitude argument may yield a result with little or no
significance.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn cos ,
.Fn cosf
and
.Fn cosl
functions return the cosine value.
