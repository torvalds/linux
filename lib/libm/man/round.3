.In math.h
.Ft double
.Fn round "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn roundf "float x"
.Ft long double
.Fn roundl "long double x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn round ,
.Fn roundf
and
.Fn roundl
functions return the nearest integral value to
.Fa x ;
if
.Fa x
lies halfway between two integral values, then these
functions return the integral value with the larger
absolute value (i.e., they round away from zero).
