.Sh NAME
.Nm clog ,
.Nm clogf ,
.Nm clogl
.Nd complex natural logarithm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Lb libm
.In complex.h
.Ft double complex
.Fn clog "double complex z"
.Ft float complex
.Fn clogf "float complex z"
.Ft long double complex
.Fn clogl "long double complex z"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn clog ,
.Fn clogf
and
.Fn clogl
functions compute the complex logarithm to the base
.Ms e
(2.718...) of
.Fa z .
.Pp
If
.Fa z
= x + iy, then
.Bd -literal -offset indent
clog(z) = log(sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) + i atan(y / x).

.Fn clog ,
.Fn clogf
and
.Fn clogl
functions return the complex logarithm to the base
.Ms e
of
.Fa z
with imaginary part in the interval
.Bq -Pi, Pi ,
and unbounded real part.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cexp 3 ,
.Xr cpow 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn clog ,
.Fn clogf
and
.Fn clogl
functions conform to
.St -isoC-99 .
