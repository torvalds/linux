.SH NAME
\fBform_page\fP \- set and get form page number
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint set_current_field(FORM *\fIform\fB, FIELD *\fIfield\fB);\fR
.br
\fBFIELD *current_field(const FORM *\fIform\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint unfocus_current_field(FORM *\fIform\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint set_form_page(FORM *\fIform\fB, int \fIn\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint form_page(const FORM *\fIform\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint field_index(const FIELD *\fIfield\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_current_field\fP sets the current field of the given
form; \fBcurrent_field\fP returns the current field of the given form.
.PP
The function \fBunfocus_current_field\fP removes the focus from the current
field of the form.
In such state, inquiries via \fBcurrent_field\fP shall return a NULL pointer.
.PP
The function \fBset_form_page\fP sets the form's page number (goes to page
\fIn\fP of the form).
.PP
The function \fBform_page\fP returns the form's current page number.
.PP
The function \fBfield_index\fP returns the index of the field in the
field array of the form it is connected to.
It returns \fBERR\fP if
the argument is the null pointer or the field is not connected.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Except for \fBform_page\fP, each routine returns one of the following:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_STATE
Routine was called from an initialization or termination function.
.TP 5
.B E_INVALID_FIELD
Contents of a field are not valid.
.TP 5
.B E_REQUEST_DENIED
The form driver could not process the request.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fP(3)).
.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3), \fBform\fP(3).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fP automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fP.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
.PP
The \fBunfocus_current_field\fP function is an ncurses extension.
