.SH DESCRIPTION
These are building blocks for the form library,
defining fields that can be created using
the \fBform_fieldtype\fP(3) functions.
Each provides functions for field- and character-validation,
according to the given datatype.
.SS TYPE_ALNUM
This holds alphanumeric data.
.SS TYPE_ALPHA
This holds alphabetic data.
.SS TYPE_ENUM
This holds an enumerated type.
.SS TYPE_INTEGER
This holds a decimal integer.
.SS TYPE_IPV4
This holds an IPv4 internet address, e.g., "127.0.0.1".
.SS TYPE_NUMERIC
This holds a decimal number, with optional sign and decimal point.
.SS TYPE_REGEXP
This holds a regular expression.
.SH PORTABILITY
The \fBTYPE_IPV4\fP variable is an extension not provided by older
implementations of the form library.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBform\fP(3).
