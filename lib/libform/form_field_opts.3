.TH form_field_opts 3 2023-07-01 "ncurses 6.4" "Library calls"
.SH NAME
\fBset_field_opts\fP,
\fBfield_opts_on\fP,
\fBfield_opts_off\fP,
\fBfield_opts\fP \- set and get field options
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint set_field_opts(FIELD *\fIfield\fB, Field_Options \fIopts\fB);\fR
.br
\fBField_Options field_opts(const FIELD *\fIfield\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint field_opts_on(FIELD *\fIfield\fB, Field_Options \fIopts\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint field_opts_off(FIELD *\fIfield\fB, Field_Options \fIopts\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_field_opts\fP sets all the given field's option bits (field
option bits may be logically-OR'ed together).
.PP
The function \fBfield_opts_on\fP turns on the given option bits, and leaves
others alone.
.PP
The function \fBfield_opts_off\fP turns off the given option bits, and leaves
others alone.
.PP
The function \fBfield_opts\fP returns the field's current option bits.
.PP
The following standard options are defined (all are on by default):
.TP 5
O_ACTIVE
The field is visited during processing.
If this option is off, the field will
not be reachable by navigation keys.
Please notice that an invisible field
appears to be inactive also.
.TP 5
O_AUTOSKIP
Skip to the next field when this one fills.
.TP 5
O_BLANK
The field is cleared whenever a character is entered at the first position.
.TP 5
O_EDIT
The field can be edited.
.TP 5
O_NULLOK
Allow a blank field.
.TP 5
O_PASSOK
Validate field only if modified by user.
.TP 5
O_PUBLIC
The field contents are displayed as data is entered.
.TP 5
O_STATIC
Field buffers are fixed to field's original size.
Turn this option off to create a dynamic field.
.TP 5
O_VISIBLE
The field is displayed.
If this option is off, display of the field is
suppressed.
.TP 5
O_WRAP
Words that do not fit on a line are wrapped to the next line.
Words are
blank-separated.
.PP
These extension options are defined (extensions are off by default):
.TP 5
O_DYNAMIC_JUSTIFY
Permit dynamic fields to be justified, like static fields.
.TP 5
O_NO_LEFT_STRIP
Preserve leading whitespace in the field buffer, which is normally discarded.
.TP 5
O_EDGE_INSERT_STAY
When inserting into a field up to the boundary position,
optionally delay the scrolling,
so that the last inserted character remains visible,
but advance the cursor to reflect the insertion.
This allows the form library to display the
inserted character in one-character fields
as well as allowing the library to maintain consistent state.
.TP 5
O_INPUT_FIELD
The \fBset_max_field\fP function checks for this extension,
which allows a dynamic field to shrink if the new
limit is smaller than the current field size.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Except for \fBfield_opts\fP, each routine returns one of the following:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_CURRENT
The field is the current field.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fP(3)).
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3),
\fBform\fP(3).
\fBform_field_just\fP(3).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fP automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fP.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
