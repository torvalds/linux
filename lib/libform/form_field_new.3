.SH NAME
\fBnew_field\fP,
\fBdup_field\fP,
\fBlink_field\fP,
\fBfree_field\fP \- create and destroy form fields
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fP
.sp
\fBFIELD *new_field(int \fIheight\fB, int \fIwidth\fB,\fR
                 \fBint \fItoprow\fB, int \fIleftcol\fB,\fR
                 \fBint \fIoffscreen\fB, int \fInbuffers\fB);\fR
.br
\fBFIELD *dup_field(FIELD *\fIfield\fB, int \fItoprow\fB, int \fIleftcol\fB);\fR
.br
\fBFIELD *link_field(FIELD *\fIfield\fB, int \fItoprow\fB, int \fIleftcol\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint free_field(FIELD *\fIfield\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBnew_field\fP allocates a new field and initializes it from the
parameters given: height, width, row of upper-left corner, column of upper-left
corner, number off-screen rows, and number of additional working buffers.
.PP
The function \fBdup_field\fP duplicates a field at a new location.
Most
attributes (including current contents, size, validation type, buffer count,
growth threshold, justification, foreground, background, pad character,
options, and user pointer) are copied.
Field status and the field page bit are
not copied.
.PP
The function \fBlink_field\fP acts like \fBdup_field\fP, but the new field
shares buffers with its parent.
Attribute data is separate.
.PP
The function \fBfree_field\fP de-allocates storage associated with a field.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The functions \fBnew_field\fP, \fBdup_field\fP, \fBlink_field\fP return
\fBNULL\fP on error.
They set \fBerrno\fP according to their success:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred, e.g., malloc failure.
.PP
The function \fBfree_field\fP returns one of the following:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_CONNECTED
field is connected.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3), \fBform\fP(3).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fP automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fP.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
.PP
It may be unwise to count on the set of attributes copied by
\fBdup_field\fP being portable; the System V forms library documents are
not very explicit about what gets copied and what does not.
