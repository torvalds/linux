.SH NAME
\fBset_form_opts\fP,
\fBform_opts_on\fP,
\fBform_opts_off\fP,
\fBform_opts\fP \- set and get form options
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint set_form_opts(FORM *\fIform\fB, Field_Options \fIopts\fB);\fR
.br
\fBField_Options form_opts(const FORM *\fIform\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint form_opts_on(FORM *\fIform\fB, Field_Options \fIopts\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint form_opts_off(FORM *\fIform\fB, Field_Options \fIopts\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_form_opts\fP sets all the given form's option bits (form
option bits may be logically-OR'ed together).
.PP
The function \fBform_opts_on\fP turns on the given option bits, and leaves
others alone.
.PP
The function \fBform_opts_off\fP turns off the given option bits, and leaves
others alone.

.PP
The following options are defined (all are on by default):
.TP 5
O_NL_OVERLOAD

end of a field goes to the next field.
.TP 5
O_BS_OVERLOAD
Overload the \fBREQ_DEL_PREV\fP forms driver request so that calling it at the
beginning of a field goes to the previous field.

.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
