.TH form_win 3 2023-07-01 "ncurses 6.4" "Library calls"
.SH NAME
\fBform_win\fP \- make and break form window and subwindow associations
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint set_form_win(FORM *\fIform\fB, WINDOW *\fIwin\fB);\fR
.br
\fBWINDOW *form_win(const FORM *\fIform\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint set_form_sub(FORM *\fIform\fB, WINDOW *\fIsub\fB);\fR
.br
\fBWINDOW *form_sub(const FORM *\fIform\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint scale_form(const FORM *\fIform\fB, int *\fIrows\fB, int *\fIcolumns\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Every form has an associated pair of \fBcurses\fP windows.
The form window
displays any title and border associated with the window; the form subwindow
displays the items of the form that are currently available for selection.
.PP
The first four functions get and set those windows.
It is not necessary to set
either window; by default, the driver code uses \fBstdscr\fP for both.
.PP
In the \fBset_\fP functions, window argument of \fBNULL\fP is treated as though
it were \fBstsdcr\fP.  A form argument of \fBNULL\fP is treated as a request
to change the system default form window or subwindow.
.PP
The function \fBscale_form\fP returns the minimum size required for the
subwindow of \fIform\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Routines that return pointers return \fBNULL\fP on error.
Routines that return
an integer return one of the following error codes:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fP(3)).
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_POSTED
The form has already been posted.
.TP 5
.B E_NOT_CONNECTED
No items are connected to the form.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3),
\fBcurs_variables\fP(3),
\fBform\fP(3).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fP automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fP.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
