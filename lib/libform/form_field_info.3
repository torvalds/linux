.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <form.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint field_info(const FIELD *\fIfield\fB,\fR
               \fBint *\fIrows\fB, int *\fIcols\fB,\fR
               \fBint *\fIfrow\fB, int *\fIfcol\fB,\fR
               \fBint *\fInrow\fB, int *\fInbuf\fB);\fR
.sp
\fBint dynamic_field_info(const FIELD *\fIfield\fB,\fR
                       \fBint *\fIrows\fB, int *\fIcols\fB, int *\fImax\fB);\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBfield_info\fP returns the sizes and other attributes passed in
to the field at its creation time.
The attributes are: height, width, row of
upper-left corner, column of upper-left corner, number off-screen rows, and
number of working buffers.
.PP
The function \fBdynamic_field_info\fP returns the actual size of the field, and
its maximum possible size.
If the field has no size limit, the location
addressed by the third argument will be set to 0.
A field can be made dynamic
by turning off the \fBO_STATIC\fP option with \fBfield_opts_off\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
These routines return one of the following:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fP(3)).
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3) and related pages whose names begin \*(``form_\*('' for detailed
descriptions of the entry points.
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fP automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fP.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
.PP
A null (zero pointer) is accepted for any of the return values,
to ignore that value.
Not all implementations allow this, e.g., Solaris 2.7 does not.
