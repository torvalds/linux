.TH form_field_userptr 3 2022-02-12 "ncurses 6.4" "Library calls"
.SH NAME
\fBset_field_userptr\fP,
\fBfield_userptr\fP \- associate application data with a form field
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint set_field_userptr(FIELD *\fIfield\fB, void *\fIuserptr\fB);\fR
.br
\fBvoid *field_userptr(const FIELD *\fIfield\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Every form field has a field that can be used to hold application-specific data
(that is, the form-driver code leaves it alone).
These functions get and set
that field.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function \fBfield_userptr\fP returns a pointer (which may be \fBNULL\fP).
It does not set \fBerrno\fP.
.PP
The function \fBset_field_userptr\fP returns \fBE_OK\fP (success).
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3), \fBform\fP(3).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fP automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fP.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
.PP
The user pointer is a void pointer.
We chose not to leave it as a char pointer for SVr4 compatibility.
.SH AUTHORS
Juergen Pfeifer.
