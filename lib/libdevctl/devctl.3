.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library adjusts the state of devices in the kernel's internal device
hierarchy.
Each control operation accepts a
.Fa device
argument that identifies the device to adjust.
The
.Fa device
may be specified as either the name of an existing device or as a
bus-specific address.
The following bus-specific address formats are currently supported:
.Bl -tag -offset indent
.It Sy pci Ns Fa domain Ns : Ns Fa bus Ns : Ns Fa slot Ns : Ns Fa function
A PCI device with the specified
.Fa domain ,
.Fa bus ,
.Fa slot ,
and
.Fa function .
.It Sy pci Ns Fa bus Ns : Ns Fa slot Ns : Ns Fa function
A PCI device in domain zero with the specified
.Fa bus ,
.Fa slot ,
and
.Fa function .
.It Fa handle
A device with an ACPI handle of
.Fa handle .
The handle must be specified as an absolute path and must begin with a
.Dq \e .
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn devctl_attach
function probes a device and attaches a suitable device driver if one is
found.
.Pp
The
.Fn devctl_detach
function detaches a device from its current device driver.
The device is left detached until either a new driver for its parent
bus is loaded or the device is explicitly probed via
.Fn devctl_attach .
If
.Fa force
is true,
the current device driver will be detached even if the device is busy.
.Pp
The
.Fn devctl_delete
function deletes a device from the device tree.
No
If
.Fa force
is true,
the device is deleted even if the device is physically present.
.Pp
The
.Fn devctl_disable
function disables a device.
If the device is currently attached to a device driver,
the device driver will be detached from the device,
but the device will retain its current name.
If
.Fa force_detach
is true,
the current device driver will be detached even if the device is busy.
The device will remain disabled and detached until it is explicitly enabled
via
.Fn devctl_enable .
.Pp
The
.Fn devctl_enable
function re-enables a disabled device.
The device will probe and attach if a suitable device driver is found.
.Pp
The
.Fn devctl_suspend
function suspends a device.
This may include placing the device in a reduced power state,
but any device driver currently attached to the device will remain attached.
.Pp
The
.Fn devctl_resume
function resumes a suspended device to a fully working state.
.Pp
The
.Fn devctl_set_driver
function attaches a device driver named
.Fa driver
to a device.
If the device is already attached and
.Fa force
is false,
the request will fail.
If the device is already attached and
.Fa force
is true,
the device will be detached from its current device driver before it is
attached to the new device driver.
.Pp
The
.Fn devctl_clear_driver
function resets a device so that it can be attached to any valid device
driver rather than only drivers with a previously specified name.
This function is used to undo a previous call to
.Fn devctl_set_driver .
If the device is already attached and
.Fa force
is false,
the request will fail.
If the device is already attached and
.Fa force
is true,
the device will be detached from its current device driver.
After the device's name is reset,
it is reprobed and attached to a suitable device driver if one is found.
.Pp
The
.Fn devctl_rescan
function rescans a bus device checking for devices that have been added or
removed.
.Pp
The
.Fn devctl_freeze
function freezes probe and attach processing initiated in response to
drivers being loaded.
.Pp
The
.Fn devctl_thaw
function resumes (thaws the freeze) probe and attach processing
initiated in response to drivers being loaded.

.Sh HISTORY
The

and the entire machine is subsequently suspended,
the device will be resumed when the machine resumes.
