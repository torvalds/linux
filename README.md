# Linux kernel

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
[Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst) first.

In order to build the documentation, use ```make htmldocs``` or ```make pdfdocs```.  
The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/)

There are various text files in the [Documentation/](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/Documentation) subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the [Documentation/process/changes.rst](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/process/changes.rst) file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
